            The Vindictive Monk or The Fatal Ring Isaac Crookenden The young Calini was descended of a good family  was heir to great and still-increasing wealth  was the last representative of an honorable house  and the delight and admiration not only of his doting parent, but of every body who knew him. He possessed every grace of mental perfection  for his education had been conducted on so liberal a plan, that a clear, just, and accurate perception had been the happy result of his juvenile studies. His person was every way answerable to the above delineation of his mind. His make exhibited the truest symmetry  and his countenance beamed with masculine dignity, corrected with a gracious condescension. Although Calini was reared up in the principles of the Romish church, that did not hinder him from seeing some of its absurdities  and therefore, while some of the votaries placed the essence of their religion in a gaudy exhibition of pompous ceremonies, his consisted in a steady, uniform system of good actions  an undeviating rectitude of conduct, prompted by the motive of his present and everlasting interest, as well as by the intrinsic beauty of benevolence. Such was the youth, whom we have selected for the hero of these memoirs. One day his father ( as the youth had ever considered him ), took him aside, and spake as follows - The substance of what I am now going to unfold, I once thought I should have buried in oblivion  but, upon mature deliberation, I am come to a determination of entrusting you with it. You have always been thought to be my son. This is the moment to undeceive you. You are not my child! - Not your son! exclaimed the youth, in the utmost astonishment  whose then can I be? - That you will never probably know, replied Signor Calini. But you have not many obligations to your parents, who left you to perish in your infancy. My story excites your astonishment. Listen attentively, while I disclose the circumstance which induced me to bring you up as my own offspring. About twenty years ago, as I was landing from a gondola, one dark night, on the northern shores of the Adriatic, after I had returned from visiting one of my estates, my sight was struck with a white bundle within a foot from the waves  on examining which, I found it contained an infant. It was yourself  and I resolved that the direful intention of those who left you should not only be frustrated, but I would adopt you as my son, two of mine having recently died. When I got home, I examined the bundle more accurately, and was surprised to see this ring. ( Here he presented one to the astonished youth ) You see, it is of a peculiar make  there is some name underneath. ( The young man turned it, and saw the world Ollorini engraved on it ) I bed, that from this day you would wear it, to remind you of the singular event  and be assured, my dear boy, although you are not the natural issue of my own loins, yet I shall always feel for you a father s tenderness. Here Signor Calini concluded his narration, and left his auditor overwhelmed with astonishment. The barbarity of his real parents affected him severely  but the kindness of the signor afforded him a continual source of the most pleasing sensation. A short time after this wondrous disclosure, young Calini ( for so we shall still call him ) had been to visit a young lady, to whom he was sincerely attached  and was now returning home on horseback. The night was far advanced, and very threatening. His road lay through a dark wood  in the midst of which, he was seized by two men, who dragged him along, till they came to the ruins of an old castle, where they halted, till one, who had a lamp, sought for a door, and at length told his comrade he had found it. They then led our hero through a door, and entered a gloomy stone dungeon. A strong chain, which was fastened to an enormous staple in the wall, discovered to the youth the horrors which awaited him. Here, said one of the ruffians, here is your habitation, till you resign all pretensions to lady Alexa. Our young lover now saw through the whole affair. He had been seized by order of a rival  but who this rival was, he had no means of judging. The inhuman monsters chained him to the wall, and, without speaking another word, left the dungeon. This mysterious event we shall now unfold: There lived, in the neighbourhood of Calini., a man called Sceloni  of a gloomy character, and who was never seen once to smile  he was dependant on a nobleman, and had, from motives of self-interest, engaged to administer to his lewd propensities. This nobleman was enamoured of the very same lady our hero loved. Seeing no possibility of supplanting him in her affection, he called in the aid of the dark Sceloni, to whom he promised great pecuniary rewards, if he would dispatch his rival, and secure to him the possession of Alexa. The avaricious Italian undertook to perform what he required. For this purpose, he way-laid the youth on his return from Alexa s house, as we have observed. But as he did not wish to embrue his hands in blood, if it could be done without, he had conveyed him to the ruins of the castle, whose intricate windings he well knew. Here he meant to keep him, till he should be able to extort an oath from him, that he would for ever resign all pretensions to Alexa. When he left the dungeon, he went directly to his employer, and told him the rival of his love was removed beyond the possibility of again being formidable. Signor Holbruzi took these words to mean no less than the death of the youth  and therefore he reaped the golden reward he aimed at. But, notwithstanding this, Alexa was decidedly against his suit  and as she could not but be surprised at Calini s unaccountable absence, as well as very much affected at it  she not only conceived addition disgust at Hobruzfs address, but began to be suspicious of some base design having been executed against Calini. In the mean time, that unfortunate youth was suffering the severest extremities of imprisonment, and calling in vain on his dear Alexa. He was visited in the dungeon frequently by Sceloni, who endeavored, by every means in his power, to make him resign all pretension to Alexa  but he was steady in his refusal  nor did he yield, even when he was threatened with assassination. Calini was as unsuccessful in trying to discover the name and quality of his rival, as Sceloni was in extorting a resignation of Alexa. After Sceloni had quitted the dungeon, the miserable youth began to reflect anew on his unhappy situation. He saw no probability of being united to the beloved object of his soul  why not then resign her? There was something in this word which seemed to imply cowardice, and he pertinaciously objected it. Holbruzi finding Alexa so little disposed to favor his passion, was resolved to possess her at all events. He ordered Sceloni to force her from her home, and bring her to his palace  which, under cover of a dark night, he effected. Alexa was left an orphan at an early age  and, after her parents death, she was reared up by a tender aunt, who loved her as her own child  but having a very slender income, necessity had obliged her to part with an estate in Piedmont, and she had purchased a small but near villa in the neighborhood of Naples, where she resided with her beloved niece. The young Calini had found them out in their retirement, and had made his addresses to the fair Alexa  which at first was discouraged by the aunt, not as she had any objection to the youth  on the contrary, she was convinced he was worthy of her niece  but she knew the girl was his inferior in point of fortune. Yet when she found how firm he had taken hold of Alexa s heart, and likewise heard of the liberal sentiments of signor Calini, she no longer opposed the mutual bias of their young and innocent hearts. Things were in this situation, when Calini discontinued so unaccountably ( to them at least ) his visits. This circumstance, severe as it was to the young lady, was also felt by the aunt, who had conceived the greatest friendship for him. But her sorrows were unspeakably acute, when one night several ruffians broke into the hose, and tore away her beloved Alexa. These were the cruel Sceloni and his emissaries, who conveyed her to the monster Holbruzi, as already related. But that lascivious wretch did not yet find his end answered. The persecuted maid was enabled to make a vigorous resistance to his meretricious wishes. Force he could have employed  but this he determined to delay, till every other method had been tried. He thought no way so likely to weaken her virtuous resolutions, as to let her know that her union with Calini was impossible, as that being was no longer an inhabitant of earth. This fatal intelligence overwhelmed her unfortunate breast with fresh despair, and rendered Holbruzi more than ever an object of disgust and abhorrence. His pride was severely mortified by her fixed dislike and undisguised contempt. In this unreasonable moment, Sceloni solicited a new supply for his late services in bringing Alexa to his palace. Holbruzi, smarting with the indifference of that female, answered sternly, that his trifling services had already been more than sufficiently rewarded  and, after rebuking him sharply for his avarice, absolutely refused to give him another carlin ( fourpence of our money ). Sceloni seemed all humility, but he quitted the palace with a soul full of revenge  to accomplish which, he concerted a deep-laid scheme. He retired to the outskirts of the city, wrote to Holbruzi that he was leaving for his monastery ( for this wretch was of an holy order ), and going to a different part of the world  but conjured him to release the young Calini ( who he confessed was alive, but imprisoned ), and he described a dungeon where the youth was not. After he had sent this letter, he provided himself with a brace of pistols, and repaired to that very dungeon which he had mentioned in his letter as the prison of Calini. Here he threw himself on the ground, and personating the distress of that unfortunate youth, waited deliberately for Holbruzi s arrival  for he never foubted but that vindictive tyrant would come to sacrifice Calini with his own hand. He was not deceived in his conjecture. When that monster received the monk s letter, his countenance bespoke the savage passions it inspired. What! said he, my detested rival living! This night he breathes his last. He accordingly stole away that very evening, muffled up in a disguise, with a lamp in one hand, and a dagger in the other, through the dark passages of the ruins. Sceloni heard him coming, and <sound>uttered</sound> a <sound>groan</sound>, on purpose to direct his steps to the dungeon where he was. Sceloni soon heard the door unfasted, and he kept his finger close to the trigger. Holbruzi cautiously advanced the light, and then entered. The subtle Sceloni laid as if he was in a disturbed sleep. Holbruzi drew near  and as he bent over him, exclaimed favored minion! Wilt thou ever more rival me in love? Thou sleepest. Awake in - he would have said death  but at this moment the pseudo-Calini pressed the trigger, and dismissed his soul from the world. But Sceloni was not yet satisfied  his revengeful soul thirsted for more blood. He considered, that if Calini had resigned Alexa, that maid, out of revenge, might have yielded to Holbruzi  and consequently he should not have met with that mortifying refusal from him, which had stimulated him to take the bloody means that he had just executed. His vindictive spirit resolving upon a double revenge, marked Calini for a second victim. No sooner had he made this horrible determination, but, snatching up the lamp ( which had not been extinguished in falling ), and the yet bloodless dagger, he rushed out of the dungeon into that of the destined youth, fully resolved to accomplish his dreadful purpose. The report of the pistol, as it was at a considerable distance from him, and vented in a close-pent dungeon, did not reach his auditory nerves  and he was yet in a deep slumber, with his right hand on his breast. Sceloni drew near to strike  but, on observing the position of his hand, stooped down to remove it. The rays of light discovered the ring, which his supposed father desired him to wear. It excited Sceloni s curiosity. He gently drew it off, and examined it by the lamp. Each moment furnished new alarm to his terrified mind. His face assumed an ashy paleness  his jointed trembled with amazement and horror  but when he turned it up, and saw the engraved name of Ollorini upon it, his horror and astonishment was complete. He hastily threw away the dagger  and awaking the youth, interrogated him about the mysterious ring. He could only relate what his supposed father had told him. This was enough. Sceloni, while convulsive <sound>sobs</sound> <sound>burst</sound> from his torn bosom, could only exclaim, I am your father. The astonished youth looked up, and thought his reason was unsettled  but seeing his tears and <sound>groans</sound>, he knew not what to think. At length, he desired him to give some indubitable proof that he was his father. I will, my son, I will do it, answered Sceloni  but this is not a proper place for conversation  let me unbind you from these ignominious chains! He then freed the youth from his fetters  and they left the dungeon together, and retired to a small house, where, after they had entered a private room, he addressed the wondering impatient youth as follows: - Although, in reciting those circumstances which prove you to be my son, I must criminate myself  yet I shall not hesitate to do it, as I am sensible that you have more virtue than to conspire against the life of your father. Here he paused a moment  for he recollected, that he himself had conspired against the life of his son. At length, he proceeded. My real name is Dictori. I was brought up under very indulgent parents. My natural temper, which was violent in the extreme, was put into a hot-bed, by the unreasonable and fatal indulgence of those parents. Tis that indulgence which has caused my ruin. If they had done their duty, and restrained, by due correction, the impetuosity of my natural temper, I should not have been a prey to those destructive passions of my nature, which have since acted as gourds to prick me forward down the slipper path of vice. I was early attached to a lady, whose name was Mariana Vicenza  but my native pride was severely wounded, when I discovered that she not only beheld me with indifference, but with a fixed dislike. I now, through obstinacy, advanced my suit with more eagerness than ever  when it would have been more honorable silently to withdraw it. However, her parents obliged her to accept of my hand at the altar. As I never could forgive the little affection she had shown for me, I soon began to retaliate upon her after marriage. Among other passions which I vented upon her without mercy, the demon of jealousy began to agitate my restless breast with its hydra horrors. I thought it was very probably that she, who was forced to marry a man whom she did not like, should entertain in his absence one she did. My suspicions were strengthened by seeing this very ring upon her finger, which I apprehended was given her by her gallant. I went so far as to believe you was his child. In a frenzy of rage, I murdered my wife, and committed you to the waves, together with the detested and fatal ring. I have had proof since, that the very ring was given her before marriage by an uncle who had gone beyond sea  that he had his name engraved on it, which was Ollorini. As I was afraid to stay in that part, I came to Naples, and become a monk of the order of St. Francis. Spare me the rest! This truly wonderful relation affected the astonished youth a great deal. But we must take leave of Calini a little while to look after the lovely persecuted Alexa. That unfortunate maid was ready to abandon herself to despair. Torn away from her peaceful retreat by ruffians, at the dreadful, the horror-working hour of midnight, to fall a prey to the unbridled lust of a lewd barbarian! Separated from her dear aunt! Torn too from the fond, the protected arms of the youth she sighed for! what can exeed her misery, wretched captive as she then was in the most hated mansion of the nefarious monster Holbruzi? for she as yet knew nothing of the sanguinary scenes which had been exhibited in the castle-ruins. The savage Holbruzi, when he left his house at midnight, had consigned the wretched maid to one of his trusty servants, who executed with relentless rigor the confidence reposed in him. We now, for a short time, turn from the unhappy beauty, to see the mournful effect which her loss had upon her disconsolate aunt. That distressed matron, now separate by cruel fate from a beloved niece, in whom her very existence seemed to be wrapt up, experience the most poignant anguish that can possibly be imagined. She wrung her aged hands in wild despair, and in frantic accents called on her far-off niece, her dear Alexa. While she was in the heighth of her <sound>lamentation</sound>, a <sound>knocking</sound> at the door was heard. For a considerable time she was afraid to open it, least, in so doing, she should let in those who ravished from her embraces her beloved niece, and thereby become herself a victim of their savage fury. But while she hesitated what to do, she heard a voice at the door requesting admission  the cadence of which she thought she remembered, though her distress would not permit her to be certain to whom it belonged. She however assumed courage sufficient to open it, when Calini directly rushed in. As he knew nothing of Alexa being at Holbruzi s detested mansion, he, as soon as he left the monk, repaired to her residence, though not without dreadful apprehensions for her safety, occasioned by the silence of Sceloni, on his asking after her. It may perhaps be thought strange, that the monk should not have told his son where she was  seeing he knew she was at Holbruzi s palace. But, if we consider that he had been some time absent from Naples, and that he knew so much of that villain as to think it probable that he had murdered that maid, before he intended to assassinate her lover, we shall cease to wonder at his conduct. Add to this, that if he had discovered to Calini that Alexa was at Holbruzi s mansion, it would naturally have introduced an inquiry into that monster s mysterious absence - an inquiry which would doubtless have directed the finger of suspicion to himself. This was what the monk dreaded should transpire. He had already dipped his hands so deep in blood, that his conscience was already pointing to the gibbet, or the inquisitional torture. He had therefore preserved an obstinate silence respecting Alexa  and our hero, unable to endure the tortures of suspense, flew upon the pinions of indescribable anxiety to her aunt s, as already mentioned. The reputed father of our hero received his foster son with the greatest joy imaginable, and heard with astonishment and horror the circumstances which had happened to him. He was, however, severely afflicted at the loss of the amiable Alexa  for that lovely maid stood very high both in his esteem and affection  and he had beheld the growing love which the youth evinced for her with cheerful approbation. It excited his utmost surprise to think who could possibly have stolen her from her peaceful home. He little thought that it was the machinations of one who often partook of his hospitality, and had been a frequent visitor at his festive board. But this very consideration enabled our hero to trace out her persecutor, and her present prison. He recollected Holbruzi being at his father s, as he then thought him  as likewise, that he was always exceedingly discourteous to himself, the occasion of which he had in vain attempted to unravel  but now it appeared plain enough. Calini considered also, that he knew perfectly well of his love for Alexa, and also the place of that young lady s residence. When therefore he, in his cooler moments, put all of these circumstances together the suspicions they excited were so strong, that our unfortunate youth found it impossible to think otherways than that he must be certainly somehow concerned, if not the principal agent in the removal of the unfortunate girl. Influence by this supposition, he determined to go directly to the palace of Holbruzi, to see if the beloved of his soul was really there. But, upon second thoughts, he resolved to await all night  and set spies in the mean time about the house, to discover, if possible, the secret transactions going forward in it. The spires brought him intelligence, that they saw a young lady superficially through one of the windows, leaning upon her arm in a melancholy posture, and that she appeared to be in extreme distress. This was sufficient to stimulate our hero to instant exertion. He directly went, with a desperate determination, well armed  resolving, if they denied him admission, to force the door. But the servant admitted him upon the first summons, expecting it was his master. Our hero instantly rushed up stairs  and hearing a female <sound>scream</sound>, he broke into the room, and beheld his beloved Alexa, struggling in the embraces of a ruffian  whom he severely wounded, and rescued the lovely maid. How was she rejoiced to see her dear, her loved Calini! Sceloni had the satisfaction of seeing them happy before he retired for life to his monastery. He now found no difficulty in being united to his dear Alexa  whose marriage was celebrated amid an amazing multitude of admiring spectators. The monk, after this, was never seen beyond the walls of his convent  but passed his life in the most rigorous penance. The Vindictive Monk or The Fatal Ring Isaac Crookenden The young Calini was descended of a good family  was heir to great and still-increasing wealth  was the last representative of an honorable house  and the delight and admiration not only of his doting parent, but of every body who knew him. He possessed every grace of mental perfection  for his education had been conducted on so liberal a plan, that a clear, just, and accurate perception had been the happy result of his juvenile studies. His person was every way answerable to the above delineation of his mind. His make exhibited the truest symmetry  and his countenance beamed with masculine dignity, corrected with a gracious condescension. Although Calini was reared up in the principles of the Romish church, that did not hinder him from seeing some of its absurdities  and therefore, while some of the votaries placed the essence of their religion in a gaudy exhibition of pompous ceremonies, his consisted in a steady, uniform system of good actions  an undeviating rectitude of conduct, prompted by the motive of his present and everlasting interest, as well as by the intrinsic beauty of benevolence. Such was the youth, whom we have selected for the hero of these memoirs. One day his father ( as the youth had ever considered him ), took him aside, and spake as follows - The substance of what I am now going to unfold, I once thought I should have buried in oblivion  but, upon mature deliberation, I am come to a determination of entrusting you with it. You have always been thought to be my son. This is the moment to undeceive you. You are not my child! - Not your son! exclaimed the youth, in the utmost astonishment  whose then can I be? - That you will never probably know, replied Signor Calini. But you have not many obligations to your parents, who left you to perish in your infancy. My story excites your astonishment. Listen attentively, while I disclose the circumstance which induced me to bring you up as my own offspring. About twenty years ago, as I was landing from a gondola, one dark night, on the northern shores of the Adriatic, after I had returned from visiting one of my estates, my sight was struck with a white bundle within a foot from the waves  on examining which, I found it contained an infant. It was yourself  and I resolved that the direful intention of those who left you should not only be frustrated, but I would adopt you as my son, two of mine having recently died. When I got home, I examined the bundle more accurately, and was surprised to see this ring. ( Here he presented one to the astonished youth ) You see, it is of a peculiar make  there is some name underneath. ( The young man turned it, and saw the world Ollorini engraved on it ) I bed, that from this day you would wear it, to remind you of the singular event  and be assured, my dear boy, although you are not the natural issue of my own loins, yet I shall always feel for you a father s tenderness. Here Signor Calini concluded his narration, and left his auditor overwhelmed with astonishment. The barbarity of his real parents affected him severely  but the kindness of the signor afforded him a continual source of the most pleasing sensation. A short time after this wondrous disclosure, young Calini ( for so we shall still call him ) had been to visit a young lady, to whom he was sincerely attached  and was now returning home on horseback. The night was far advanced, and very threatening. His road lay through a dark wood  in the midst of which, he was seized by two men, who dragged him along, till they came to the ruins of an old castle, where they halted, till one, who had a lamp, sought for a door, and at length told his comrade he had found it. They then led our hero through a door, and entered a gloomy stone dungeon. A strong chain, which was fastened to an enormous staple in the wall, discovered to the youth the horrors which awaited him. Here, said one of the ruffians, here is your habitation, till you resign all pretensions to lady Alexa. Our young lover now saw through the whole affair. He had been seized by order of a rival  but who this rival was, he had no means of judging. The inhuman monsters chained him to the wall, and, without speaking another word, left the dungeon. This mysterious event we shall now unfold: There lived, in the neighbourhood of Calini., a man called Sceloni  of a gloomy character, and who was never seen once to smile  he was dependant on a nobleman, and had, from motives of self-interest, engaged to administer to his lewd propensities. This nobleman was enamoured of the very same lady our hero loved. Seeing no possibility of supplanting him in her affection, he called in the aid of the dark Sceloni, to whom he promised great pecuniary rewards, if he would dispatch his rival, and secure to him the possession of Alexa. The avaricious Italian undertook to perform what he required. For this purpose, he way-laid the youth on his return from Alexa s house, as we have observed. But as he did not wish to embrue his hands in blood, if it could be done without, he had conveyed him to the ruins of the castle, whose intricate windings he well knew. Here he meant to keep him, till he should be able to extort an oath from him, that he would for ever resign all pretensions to Alexa. When he left the dungeon, he went directly to his employer, and told him the rival of his love was removed beyond the possibility of again being formidable. Signor Holbruzi took these words to mean no less than the death of the youth  and therefore he reaped the golden reward he aimed at. But, notwithstanding this, Alexa was decidedly against his suit  and as she could not but be surprised at Calini s unaccountable absence, as well as very much affected at it  she not only conceived addition disgust at Hobruzfs address, but began to be suspicious of some base design having been executed against Calini. In the mean time, that unfortunate youth was suffering the severest extremities of imprisonment, and calling in vain on his dear Alexa. He was visited in the dungeon frequently by Sceloni, who endeavored, by every means in his power, to make him resign all pretension to Alexa  but he was steady in his refusal  nor did he yield, even when he was threatened with assassination. Calini was as unsuccessful in trying to discover the name and quality of his rival, as Sceloni was in extorting a resignation of Alexa. After Sceloni had quitted the dungeon, the miserable youth began to reflect anew on his unhappy situation. He saw no probability of being united to the beloved object of his soul  why not then resign her? There was something in this word which seemed to imply cowardice, and he pertinaciously objected it. Holbruzi finding Alexa so little disposed to favor his passion, was resolved to possess her at all events. He ordered Sceloni to force her from her home, and bring her to his palace  which, under cover of a dark night, he effected. Alexa was left an orphan at an early age  and, after her parents death, she was reared up by a tender aunt, who loved her as her own child  but having a very slender income, necessity had obliged her to part with an estate in Piedmont, and she had purchased a small but near villa in the neighborhood of Naples, where she resided with her beloved niece. The young Calini had found them out in their retirement, and had made his addresses to the fair Alexa  which at first was discouraged by the aunt, not as she had any objection to the youth  on the contrary, she was convinced he was worthy of her niece  but she knew the girl was his inferior in point of fortune. Yet when she found how firm he had taken hold of Alexa s heart, and likewise heard of the liberal sentiments of signor Calini, she no longer opposed the mutual bias of their young and innocent hearts. Things were in this situation, when Calini discontinued so unaccountably ( to them at least ) his visits. This circumstance, severe as it was to the young lady, was also felt by the aunt, who had conceived the greatest friendship for him. But her sorrows were unspeakably acute, when one night several ruffians broke into the hose, and tore away her beloved Alexa. These were the cruel Sceloni and his emissaries, who conveyed her to the monster Holbruzi, as already related. But that lascivious wretch did not yet find his end answered. The persecuted maid was enabled to make a vigorous resistance to his meretricious wishes. Force he could have employed  but this he determined to delay, till every other method had been tried. He thought no way so likely to weaken her virtuous resolutions, as to let her know that her union with Calini was impossible, as that being was no longer an inhabitant of earth. This fatal intelligence overwhelmed her unfortunate breast with fresh despair, and rendered Holbruzi more than ever an object of disgust and abhorrence. His pride was severely mortified by her fixed dislike and undisguised contempt. In this unreasonable moment, Sceloni solicited a new supply for his late services in bringing Alexa to his palace. Holbruzi, smarting with the indifference of that female, answered sternly, that his trifling services had already been more than sufficiently rewarded  and, after rebuking him sharply for his avarice, absolutely refused to give him another carlin ( fourpence of our money ). Sceloni seemed all humility, but he quitted the palace with a soul full of revenge  to accomplish which, he concerted a deep-laid scheme. He retired to the outskirts of the city, wrote to Holbruzi that he was leaving for his monastery ( for this wretch was of an holy order ), and going to a different part of the world  but conjured him to release the young Calini ( who he confessed was alive, but imprisoned ), and he described a dungeon where the youth was not. After he had sent this letter, he provided himself with a brace of pistols, and repaired to that very dungeon which he had mentioned in his letter as the prison of Calini. Here he threw himself on the ground, and personating the distress of that unfortunate youth, waited deliberately for Holbruzi s arrival  for he never foubted but that vindictive tyrant would come to sacrifice Calini with his own hand. He was not deceived in his conjecture. When that monster received the monk s letter, his countenance bespoke the savage passions it inspired. What! said he, my detested rival living! This night he breathes his last. He accordingly stole away that very evening, muffled up in a disguise, with a lamp in one hand, and a dagger in the other, through the dark passages of the ruins. Sceloni heard him coming, and <sound>uttered</sound> a <sound>groan</sound>, on purpose to direct his steps to the dungeon where he was. Sceloni soon heard the door unfasted, and he kept his finger close to the trigger. Holbruzi cautiously advanced the light, and then entered. The subtle Sceloni laid as if he was in a disturbed sleep. Holbruzi drew near  and as he bent over him, exclaimed favored minion! Wilt thou ever more rival me in love? Thou sleepest. Awake in - he would have said death  but at this moment the pseudo-Calini pressed the trigger, and dismissed his soul from the world. But Sceloni was not yet satisfied  his revengeful soul thirsted for more blood. He considered, that if Calini had resigned Alexa, that maid, out of revenge, might have yielded to Holbruzi  and consequently he should not have met with that mortifying refusal from him, which had stimulated him to take the bloody means that he had just executed. His vindictive spirit resolving upon a double revenge, marked Calini for a second victim. No sooner had he made this horrible determination, but, snatching up the lamp ( which had not been extinguished in falling ), and the yet bloodless dagger, he rushed out of the dungeon into that of the destined youth, fully resolved to accomplish his dreadful purpose. The report of the pistol, as it was at a considerable distance from him, and vented in a close-pent dungeon, did not reach his auditory nerves  and he was yet in a deep slumber, with his right hand on his breast. Sceloni drew near to strike  but, on observing the position of his hand, stooped down to remove it. The rays of light discovered the ring, which his supposed father desired him to wear. It excited Sceloni s curiosity. He gently drew it off, and examined it by the lamp. Each moment furnished new alarm to his terrified mind. His face assumed an ashy paleness  his jointed trembled with amazement and horror  but when he turned it up, and saw the engraved name of Ollorini upon it, his horror and astonishment was complete. He hastily threw away the dagger  and awaking the youth, interrogated him about the mysterious ring. He could only relate what his supposed father had told him. This was enough. Sceloni, while convulsive <sound>sobs</sound> <sound>burst</sound> from his torn bosom, could only exclaim, I am your father. The astonished youth looked up, and thought his reason was unsettled  but seeing his tears and <sound>groans</sound>, he knew not what to think. At length, he desired him to give some indubitable proof that he was his father. I will, my son, I will do it, answered Sceloni  but this is not a proper place for conversation  let me unbind you from these ignominious chains! He then freed the youth from his fetters  and they left the dungeon together, and retired to a small house, where, after they had entered a private room, he addressed the wondering impatient youth as follows: - Although, in reciting those circumstances which prove you to be my son, I must criminate myself  yet I shall not hesitate to do it, as I am sensible that you have more virtue than to conspire against the life of your father. Here he paused a moment  for he recollected, that he himself had conspired against the life of his son. At length, he proceeded. My real name is Dictori. I was brought up under very indulgent parents. My natural temper, which was violent in the extreme, was put into a hot-bed, by the unreasonable and fatal indulgence of those parents. Tis that indulgence which has caused my ruin. If they had done their duty, and restrained, by due correction, the impetuosity of my natural temper, I should not have been a prey to those destructive passions of my nature, which have since acted as gourds to prick me forward down the slipper path of vice. I was early attached to a lady, whose name was Mariana Vicenza  but my native pride was severely wounded, when I discovered that she not only beheld me with indifference, but with a fixed dislike. I now, through obstinacy, advanced my suit with more eagerness than ever  when it would have been more honorable silently to withdraw it. However, her parents obliged her to accept of my hand at the altar. As I never could forgive the little affection she had shown for me, I soon began to retaliate upon her after marriage. Among other passions which I vented upon her without mercy, the demon of jealousy began to agitate my restless breast with its hydra horrors. I thought it was very probably that she, who was forced to marry a man whom she did not like, should entertain in his absence one she did. My suspicions were strengthened by seeing this very ring upon her finger, which I apprehended was given her by her gallant. I went so far as to believe you was his child. In a frenzy of rage, I murdered my wife, and committed you to the waves, together with the detested and fatal ring. I have had proof since, that the very ring was given her before marriage by an uncle who had gone beyond sea  that he had his name engraved on it, which was Ollorini. As I was afraid to stay in that part, I came to Naples, and become a monk of the order of St. Francis. Spare me the rest! This truly wonderful relation affected the astonished youth a great deal. But we must take leave of Calini a little while to look after the lovely persecuted Alexa. That unfortunate maid was ready to abandon herself to despair. Torn away from her peaceful retreat by ruffians, at the dreadful, the horror-working hour of midnight, to fall a prey to the unbridled lust of a lewd barbarian! Separated from her dear aunt! Torn too from the fond, the protected arms of the youth she sighed for! what can exeed her misery, wretched captive as she then was in the most hated mansion of the nefarious monster Holbruzi? for she as yet knew nothing of the sanguinary scenes which had been exhibited in the castle-ruins. The savage Holbruzi, when he left his house at midnight, had consigned the wretched maid to one of his trusty servants, who executed with relentless rigor the confidence reposed in him. We now, for a short time, turn from the unhappy beauty, to see the mournful effect which her loss had upon her disconsolate aunt. That distressed matron, now separate by cruel fate from a beloved niece, in whom her very existence seemed to be wrapt up, experience the most poignant anguish that can possibly be imagined. She wrung her aged hands in wild despair, and in frantic accents called on her far-off niece, her dear Alexa. While she was in the heighth of her <sound>lamentation</sound>, a <sound>knocking</sound> at the door was heard. For a considerable time she was afraid to open it, least, in so doing, she should let in those who ravished from her embraces her beloved niece, and thereby become herself a victim of their savage fury. But while she hesitated what to do, she heard a voice at the door requesting admission  the cadence of which she thought she remembered, though her distress would not permit her to be certain to whom it belonged. She however assumed courage sufficient to open it, when Calini directly rushed in. As he knew nothing of Alexa being at Holbruzi s detested mansion, he, as soon as he left the monk, repaired to her residence, though not without dreadful apprehensions for her safety, occasioned by the silence of Sceloni, on his asking after her. It may perhaps be thought strange, that the monk should not have told his son where she was  seeing he knew she was at Holbruzi s palace. But, if we consider that he had been some time absent from Naples, and that he knew so much of that villain as to think it probable that he had murdered that maid, before he intended to assassinate her lover, we shall cease to wonder at his conduct. Add to this, that if he had discovered to Calini that Alexa was at Holbruzi s mansion, it would naturally have introduced an inquiry into that monster s mysterious absence - an inquiry which would doubtless have directed the finger of suspicion to himself. This was what the monk dreaded should transpire. He had already dipped his hands so deep in blood, that his conscience was already pointing to the gibbet, or the inquisitional torture. He had therefore preserved an obstinate silence respecting Alexa  and our hero, unable to endure the tortures of suspense, flew upon the pinions of indescribable anxiety to her aunt s, as already mentioned. The reputed father of our hero received his foster son with the greatest joy imaginable, and heard with astonishment and horror the circumstances which had happened to him. He was, however, severely afflicted at the loss of the amiable Alexa  for that lovely maid stood very high both in his esteem and affection  and he had beheld the growing love which the youth evinced for her with cheerful approbation. It excited his utmost surprise to think who could possibly have stolen her from her peaceful home. He little thought that it was the machinations of one who often partook of his hospitality, and had been a frequent visitor at his festive board. But this very consideration enabled our hero to trace out her persecutor, and her present prison. He recollected Holbruzi being at his father s, as he then thought him  as likewise, that he was always exceedingly discourteous to himself, the occasion of which he had in vain attempted to unravel  but now it appeared plain enough. Calini considered also, that he knew perfectly well of his love for Alexa, and also the place of that young lady s residence. When therefore he, in his cooler moments, put all of these circumstances together the suspicions they excited were so strong, that our unfortunate youth found it impossible to think otherways than that he must be certainly somehow concerned, if not the principal agent in the removal of the unfortunate girl. Influence by this supposition, he determined to go directly to the palace of Holbruzi, to see if the beloved of his soul was really there. But, upon second thoughts, he resolved to await all night  and set spies in the mean time about the house, to discover, if possible, the secret transactions going forward in it. The spires brought him intelligence, that they saw a young lady superficially through one of the windows, leaning upon her arm in a melancholy posture, and that she appeared to be in extreme distress. This was sufficient to stimulate our hero to instant exertion. He directly went, with a desperate determination, well armed  resolving, if they denied him admission, to force the door. But the servant admitted him upon the first summons, expecting it was his master. Our hero instantly rushed up stairs  and hearing a female <sound>scream</sound>, he broke into the room, and beheld his beloved Alexa, struggling in the embraces of a ruffian  whom he severely wounded, and rescued the lovely maid. How was she rejoiced to see her dear, her loved Calini! Sceloni had the satisfaction of seeing them happy before he retired for life to his monastery. He now found no difficulty in being united to his dear Alexa  whose marriage was celebrated amid an amazing multitude of admiring spectators. The monk, after this, was never seen beyond the walls of his convent  but passed his life in the most rigorous penance.
