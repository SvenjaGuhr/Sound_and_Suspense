<lowSuspense4>june 17 1816 </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> 1816 in the year 17 having for some time determined on a journey through countries not hitherto much frequented by travellers </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> travellers i set out accompanied by a friend whom i shall designate by the name of augustus darvell he was a </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> a few years my elder and a man of considerable fortune and ancient family advantages which an extensive capacity prevented him </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> him alike from undervaluing and overrating some peculiar circumstances in his private history had rendered him to me an object of </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> of attention of interest and even of regard which neither the reserve of his manners nor occasional indication of an inquietude </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> inquietude at times approaching to alienation of mind could extinguish i was yet young in life which i had begun early </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> early but my intimacy with him was of a recent date we had been educated at the same schools and university </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> university but his progress through these had preceded mine and he had been deeply initiated into what is called the world </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> world while i was yet in my novitiate while thus engaged i heard much both of his past and present life </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> life and although in these accounts there were many and irreconcilable contradictions i could still gather from the whole that he </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> he was a being of no common order and one who whatever pains he might take to avoid remark would still </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> still be remarkable i had cultivated his acquaintance subsequently and endeavoured to obtain his friendship but this last appeared to be </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> be unattainable whatever affections he might have possessed seemed now some to have been extinguished and others to be concentred that </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> that his feelings were acute i had sufficient opportunities of observing for although he could control he could not altogether disguise </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> disguise them still he had a power of giving to one passion the appearance of another in such a manner that </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> that it was difficult to define the nature of what was working within him and the expressions of his features would </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> would vary so rapidly though slightly that it was useless to trace them to their sources it was evident that he </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> he was a prey to some cureless disquiet but whether it arose from ambition love remorse grief from one or all </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> all of these or merely from a morbid temperament akin to disease i could not discover there were circumstances alleged which </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> which might have justified the application to each of these causes but as i have before said these were so contradictory </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> contradictory and contradicted that none could be fixed upon with accuracy where there is mystery it is generally supposed that there </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> there must also be evil i know not how this may be but in him there certainly was the one though </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> though i could not ascertain the extent of the other and felt loth as far as regarded himself to believe in </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> in its existence my advances were received with sufficient coldness but i was young and not easily discouraged and at length </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> length succeeded in obtaining to a certain degree that commonplace intercourse and moderate confidence of common and everyday concerns created and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> and cemented by similarity of pursuit and frequency of meeting which is called intimacy or friendship according to the ideas of </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> of him who uses those words to express them darvell had already travelled extensively and to him i had applied for </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> for information with regard to the conduct of my intended journey it was my secret wish that he might be prevailed </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense2> prevailed on to accompany me it was also a probable hope founded upon the shadowy restlessness which i observed in him </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> him and to which the animation which he appeared to feel on such subjects and his apparent indifference to all by </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> by which he was more immediately surrounded gave fresh strength this wish i first hinted and then expressed his answer though </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> though i had partly expected it gave me all the pleasure of surprise he consented and after the requisite arrangement we </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> we commenced our voyages after journeying through various countries of the south of europe our attention was turned towards the east </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> east according to our original destination and it was in my progress through these regions that the incident occurred upon which </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> which will turn what i may have to relate the constitution of darvell which must from his appearance have been in </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> in early life more than usually robust had been for some time gradually giving away without the intervention of any apparent </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> apparent disease he had neither cough nor hectic yet he became daily more enfeebled his habits were temperate and he neither </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> neither declined nor complained of fatigue yet he was evidently wasting away he became more and more silent and sleepless and </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> and at length so seriously altered that my alarm grew proportionate to what i conceived to be his danger we had </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> had determined on our arrival at smyrna on an excursion to the ruins of ephesus and sardis from which i endeavoured </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> endeavoured to dissuade him in his present state of indisposition but in vain there appeared to be an oppression on his </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> his mind and a solemnity in his manner which ill corresponded with his eagerness to proceed on what i regarded as </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> as a mere party of pleasure little suited to a valetudinarian but i opposed him no longer and in a few </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> few days we set off together accompanied only by a serrugee and a single janizary we had passed halfway towards the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> the remains of ephesus leaving behind us the more fertile environs of smyrna and were entering upon that wild and tenantless </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> tenantless tract through the marshes and defiles which lead to the few huts yet lingering over the broken columns of diana </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> diana the roofless walls of expelled christianity and the still more recent but complete desolation of abandoned mosques when the sudden </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> sudden and rapid illness of my companion obliged us to halt at a turkish cemetery the turbaned tombstones of which were </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> were the sole indication that human life had ever been a sojourner in this wilderness the only caravansera we had seen </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> seen was left some hours behind us not a vestige of a town or even cottage was within sight or hope </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense2> hope and this city of the dead appeared to be the sole refuge of my unfortunate friend who seemed on the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> the verge of becoming the last of its inhabitants in this situation i looked round for a place where he might </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> might most conveniently repose contrary to the usual aspect of mahometan burialgrounds the cypresses were in this few in number and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> and these thinly scattered over its extent the tombstones were mostly fallen and worn with age upon one of the most </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> most considerable of these and beneath one of the most spreading trees darvell supported himself in a halfreclining posture with great </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> great difficulty he asked for water i had some doubts of our being able to find any and prepared to go </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> go in search of it with hesitating despondency but he desired me to remain and turning to suleiman our janizary who </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> who stood by us smoking with great tranquility he said suleiman verbana su ie bring some water and went on describing </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> describing the spot where it was to be found with great minuteness at a small well for camels a few hundred </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> hundred yards to the right the janizary obeyed i said to darvell how did you know this he replied from our </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> our situation you must perceive that this place was once inhabited and could not have been so without springs i have </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> have also been here before you have been here before how came you never to mention this to me and what </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> what could you be doing in a place where no one would remain a moment longer than they could help it </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> it to this question i received no answer in the mean time suleiman returned with the water leaving the serrugee and </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> and the horses at the fountain the quenching of his thirst had the appearance of reviving him for a moment and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> and i conceived hopes of his being able to proceed or at least to return and i urged the attempt he </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> he was silent and appeared to be collecting his spirits for an effort to speak he began this is the end </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> end of my journey and of my life i came here to die but i have a request to make a </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> a command for such my last words must be you will observe it most certainly but i have better hopes i </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> i have no hopes nor wishes but this conceal my death from every human being i hope there will be no </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> no occasion that you will recover and peace it must be so promise this i do swear it by all that </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> that he here dictated an oath of great solemnity there is no occasion for this i will observe your request and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> and to doubt me is it cannot be helped you must swear i took the oath it appeared to relieve him </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> him he removed a seal ring from his finger on which were some arabic characters and presented it to me he </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> he proceeded on the ninth day of the month at noon precisely what month you please but this must be the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the day you must fling this ring into the salt springs which run into the bay of eleusis the day after </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> after at the same hour you must repair to the ruins of the temple of ceres and wait one hour why </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> why you will see the ninth day of the month you say the ninth as i observed that the present was </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> was the ninth day of the month his countenance changed and he paused as he sat evidently becoming more feeble a </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> a stork with a snake in her beak perched upon a tombstone near us and without devouring her prey appeared to </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> to be steadfastly regarding us i know not what impelled me to drive it away but the attempt was useless she </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> she made a few circles in the air and returned exactly to the same spot darvell pointed to it and smiled </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> smiled he spoke i know not whether to himself or to me but the words were only tis well what is </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> is well what do you mean no matter you must bury me here this evening and exactly where that bird is </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> is now perched you know the rest of my injunctions he then proceeded to give me several directions as to the </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> the manner in which his death might be best concealed after these were finished he exclaimed you perceive that bird certainly </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> certainly and the serpent writhing in her beak doubtless there is nothing uncommon in it it is her natural prey but </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> but it is odd that she does not devour it he smiled in a ghastly manner and said faintly it is </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> is not yet time as he spoke the stork flew away my eyes followed it for a moment it could hardly </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> hardly be longer than ten might be counted i felt darvells weight as it were increase upon my shoulder and turning </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> turning to look upon his face perceived that he was dead i was shocked with the sudden certainty which could not </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> not be mistaken his countenance in a few minutes became nearly black i should have attributed so rapid a change to </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> to poison had i not been aware that he had no opportunity of receiving it unperceived the day was declining the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the body was rapidly altering and nothing remained but to fulfil his request with the aid of suleimans ataghan and my </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> my own sabre we scooped a shallow grave upon the spot which darvell had indicated the earth easily gave way having </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> having already received some mahometan tenant we dug as deeply as the time permitted us and throwing the dry earth upon </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> upon all that remained of the singular being so lately departed we cut a few sods of greener turf from the </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> the less withered soil around us and laid them upon his sepulchre between astonishment and grief i was tearless </highSuspense1>
