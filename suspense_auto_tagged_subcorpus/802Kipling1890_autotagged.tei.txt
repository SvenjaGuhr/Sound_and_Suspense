 <highSuspense3> your gods and my godsdo you or i know which are the stronger native proverb east of suez some </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> some hold the direct control of providence ceases man being there handed over to the power of the gods and devils of asia and the church of england providence only exercising an occasional and modified supervision in the case of englishmen this theory accounts for some of the more unnecessary horrors </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> horrors of life in india it may be stretched to explain my story my friend strickland of the police who knows as much of natives of india as is good for any man can bear witness to the facts of the case dumoise our doctor also saw what strickland and i </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> i saw the inference which he drew from the evidence was entirely incorrect he is dead now he died in a rather curious manner which has been elsewhere described when fleete came to india he owned a little money and some land in the himalayas near a place called dharmsala both </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> both properties had been left him by an uncle and he came out to finance them he was a big heavy genial and inoffensive man his knowledge of natives was of course limited and he complained of the difficulties of the language he rode in from his place in the hills </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> hills to spend new year in the station and he stayed with strickland on new years eve there was a big dinner at the club and the night was excusably wet when men foregather from the uttermost ends of the empire they have a right to be riotous the frontier had </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> had sent down a contingent o catchemaliveos who had not seen twenty white faces for a year and were used to ride fifteen miles to dinner at the next fort at the risk of a khyberee bullet where their drinks should lie they profited by their new security for they tried </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> tried to play pool with a curledup hedgehog found in the garden and one of them carried the marker round the room in his teeth half a dozen planters had come in from the south and were talking horse to the biggest liar in asia who was trying to cap all </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> all their stories at once everybody was there and there was a general closing up of ranks and taking stock of our losses in dead or disabled that had fallen during the past year it was a very wet night and i remember that we sang auld lang syne with our </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> our feet in the polo championship cup and our heads among the stars and swore that we were all dear friends then some of us went away and annexed burma and some tried to open up the soudan and were opened up by fuzzies in that cruel scrub outside suakim and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> and some found stars and medals and some were married which was bad and some did other things which were worse and the others of us stayed in our chains and strove to make money on insufficient experiences fleete began the night with sherry and bitters drank champagne steadily up to </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> to dessert then raw rasping capri with all the strength of whisky took benedictine with his coffee four or five whiskies and sodas to improve his pool strokes beer and bones at halfpast two winding up with old brandy consequently when he came out at halfpast three in the morning into </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> into fourteen degrees of frost he was very angry with his horse for coughing and tried to leapfrog into the saddle the horse broke away and went to his stables so strickland and i formed a guard of dishonour to take fleete home our road lay through the bazaar close to </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> to a little temple of hanuman the monkeygod who is a leading divinity worthy of respect all gods have good points just as have all priests personally i attach much importance to hanuman and am kind to his peoplethe great gray apes of the hills one never knows when one may </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> may want a friend there was a light in the temple and as we passed we could hear voices of men chanting hymns in a native temple the priests rise at all hours of the night to do honour to their god before we could stop him fleete dashed up the </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> the steps patted two priests on the back and was gravely grinding the ashes of his cigarbutt into the forehead of the red stone image of hanuman strickland tried to drag him out but he sat down and said solemnly shee that mark of the bbeasht i made it ishnt it </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> it fine in half a minute the temple was alive and noisy and strickland who knew what came of polluting gods said that things might occur he by virtue of his official position long residence in the country and weakness for going among the natives was known to the priests and </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> and he felt unhappy fleete sat on the ground and refused to move he said that good old hanuman made a very soft pillow then without any warning a silver man came out of a recess behind the image of the god he was perfectly naked in that bitter bitter cold </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> cold and his body shone like frosted silver for he was what the bible calls a leper as white as snow also he had no face because he was a leper of some years standing and his disease was heavy upon him we two stooped to haul fleete up and the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> the temple was filling and filling with folk who seemed to spring from the earth when the silver man ran in under our arms making a noise exactly like the mewing of an otter caught fleete round the body and dropped his head on fleetes breast before we could wrench him </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> him away then he retired to a corner and sat mewing while the crowd blocked all the doors the priests were very angry until the silver man touched fleete that nuzzling seemed to sober them at the end of a few minutes silence one of the priests came to strickland and </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> and said in perfect english take your friend away he has done with hanuman but hanurnan has not done with him the crowd gave room and we carried fleete into the road strickland was very angry he said that we might all three have been knifed and that fleete should thank </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> thank his stars that he had escaped without injury fleete thanked no one he said that he wanted to go to bed he was gorgeously drunk we moved on strickland silent and wrathful until fleete was taken with violent shivering fits and sweating he said that the smells of the bazaar </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> bazaar were overpowering and he wondered why slaughterhouses were permitted so near english residences cant you smell the blood said fleete we put him to bed at last just as the dawn was breaking and strickland invited me to have another whisky and soda while we were drinking he talked of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of the trouble in the temple and admitted that it baffled him completely strickland hates being mystified by natives because his business in life is to overmatch them with their own weapons he has not yet succeeded in doing this but in fifteen or twenty years he will have made some </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> some small progress they should have mauled us he said instead of mewing at us i wonder what they meant i dont like it one little bit i said that the managing committee of the temple would in all probability bring a criminal action against us for insulting their religion there </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> there was a section of the indian penal code which exactly met fleetes offence strickland said he only hoped and prayed that they would do this before i left i looked into fleetes room and saw him lying on his right side scratching his left breast then i went to bed </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> bed cold depressed and unhappy at seven oclock in the morning at one oclock i rode over to stricklands house to inquire after fleetes head i imagined that it would be a sore one fleete was breakfasting and seemed unwell his temper was gone for he was abusing the cook for </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> for not supplying him with an underdone chop a man who can eat raw meat after a wet night is a curiosity i told fleete this and he laughed you breed queer mosquitoes in these parts he said ive been bitten to pieces but only in one place lets have a </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> a look at the bite said strickland it may have gone down since this morning while the chops were being cooked fleete opened his shirt and showed us just over his left breast a mark the perfect double of the black rosettesthe five or six irregular blotches arranged in a circleon </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> circleon a leopards hide strickland looked and said it was only pink this morning its grown black now fleete ran to a glass by jove he said this is nasty what is it we could not answer here the chops came in all red and juicy and fleete bolted three in </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> in a most offensive manner he ate on his right grinders only and threw his head over his right shoulder as he snapped the meat when he had finished it struck him that he had been behaving strangely for he said apologetically i dont think i ever felt so hungry in </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> in my life ive bolted like an ostrich after breakfast strickland said to me dont go stay here and stay for the night seeing that my house was not three miles from stricklands this request was absurd but strickland insisted and was going to say something when fleete interrupted by declaring </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> declaring in a shamefaced way that he felt hungry again strickland sent a man to my house to fetch over my bedding and a horse and we three went down to stricklands stables to pass the hours until it was time to go out for a ride the man who has </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> has a weakness for horses never wearies of inspecting them and when two men are killing time in this way they gather knowledge and lies the one from the other there were five horses in the stables and i shall never forget the scene as we tried to look them over </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> over they seemed to have gone mad they reared and screamed and nearly tore up their pickets they sweated and shivered and lathered and were distraught with fear stricklands horses used to know him as well as his dogs which made the matter more curious we left the stable for fear </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> fear of the brutes throwing themselves in their panic then strickland turned back and called me the horses were still frightened but they let us gentle and make much of them and put their heads in our bosoms they arent afraid of us said strickland dyou know id give three months </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> months pay if outrage here could talk but outrage was dumb and could only cuddle up to his master and blow out his nostrils as is the custom of horses when they wish to explain things but cant fleete came up when we were in the stalls and as soon as </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> as the horses saw him their fright broke out afresh it was all that we could do to escape from the place unkicked strickland said they dont seem to love you fleete nonsense said fleetemy mare will follow me like a dog he went to her she was in a loosebox </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> loosebox but as he slipped the bars she plunged knocked him down and broke away into the garden i laughed but strickland was not amused he took his moustache in both fists and pulled at it till it nearly came out fleete instead of going off to chase his property yawned </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> yawned saying that he felt sleepy he went to the house to lie down which was a foolish way of spending new years day strickland sat with me in the stables and asked if i had noticed anything peculiar in fleetes manner i said that he ate his food like a </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> a beast but that this might have been the result of living alone in the hills out of the reach of society as refined and elevating as ours for instance strickland was not amused i do not think that he listened to me for his next sentence referred to the mark </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> mark on fleetes breast and i said that it might have been caused by blisterflies or that it was possibly a birthmark newly born and now visible for the first time we both agreed that it was unpleasant to look at and strickland found occasion to say that i was a </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> a fool i cant tell you what i think now said he because you would call me a madman but you must stay with me for the next few days if you can i want you to watch fleete but dont tell me what you think till i have made up </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> up my mind but i am dining out tonight i said so am i said strickland and so is fleete at least if he doesnt change his mind we walked about the garden smoking but saying nothingbecause we were friends and talking spoils good tobaccotill our pipes were out then we </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> we went to wake up fleete he was wide awake and fidgeting about his room i say i want some more chops he said can i get them we laughed and said go and change the ponies will be round in a minute all right said fleete ill go when i </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> i get the chopsunderdone ones mind he seemed to be quite in earnest it was four oclock and we had had breakfast at one still for a long time he demanded those underdone chops then he changed into riding clothes and went out into the verandah his ponythe mare had not </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> not been caughtwould not let him come near all three horses were unmanageablemad with fearand finally fleete said that he would stay at home and get something to eat strickland and i rode out wondering as we passed the temple of hanuman the silver man came out and mewed at us </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> us he is not one of the regular priests of the temple said strickland i think i should peculiarly like to lay my hands on him there was no spring in our gallop on the racecourse that evening the horses were stale and moved as though they had been ridden out </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> out the fright after breakfast has been too much for them said strickland that was the only remark he made through the remainder of the ride once or twice i think he swore to himself but that did not count we came back in the dark at seven oclock and saw </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> saw that there were no lights in the bungalow careless ruffians my servants are said strickland my horse reared at something on the carriage drive and fleete stood up under its nose what are you doing grovelling about the garden said strickland but both horses bolted and nearly threw us we </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> we dismounted by the stables and returned to fleete who was on his hands and knees under the orangebushes what the devils wrong with you said strickland nothing nothing in the world said fleete speaking very quickly and thickly ive been gardeningbotanising you know the smell of the earth is delightful </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> delightful i think im going for a walka long walkall night then i saw that there was something excessively out of order somewhere and i said to strickland i am not dining out bless you said strickland here fleete get up youll catch fever there come in to dinner and lets </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> lets have the lamps lit we ll all dine at home fleete stood up unwillingly and said no lampsno lamps its much nicer here lets dine outside and have some more chopslots of em and underdonebloody ones with gristle now a december evening in northern india is bitterly cold and fleetes </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> fleetes suggestion was that of a maniac come in said strickland sternly come in at once fleete came and when the lamps were brought we saw that he was literally plastered with dirt from head to foot he must have been rolling in the garden he shrank from the light and </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> and went to his room his eyes were horrible to look at there was a green light behind them not in them if you understand and the mans lower lip hung down strickland said there is going to be troublebig troubletonight dont you change your ridingthings we waited and waited for </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> for fleetes reappearance and ordered dinner in the meantime we could hear him moving about his own room but there was no light there presently from the room came the longdrawn howl of a wolf people write and talk lightly of blood running cold and hair standing up and things of </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> of that kind both sensations are too horrible to be trifled with my heart stopped as though a knife had been driven through it and strickland turned as white as the tablecloth the howl was repeated and was answered by another howl far across the fields that set the gilded roof </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> roof on the horror strickland dashed into fleetes room i followed and we saw fleete getting out of the window he made beastnoises in the back of his throat he could not answer us when we shouted at him he spat i dont quite remember what followed but i think that </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> that strickland must have stunned him with the long bootjack or else i should never have been able to sit on his chest fleete could not speak he could only snarl and his snarls were those of a wolf not of a man the human spirit must have been giving way </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> way all day and have died out with the twilight we were dealing with a beast that had once been fleete the affair was beyond any human and rational experience i tried to say hydrophobia but the word wouldnt come because i knew that i was lying we bound this beast </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> beast with leather thongs of the punkahrope and tied its thumbs and big toes together and gagged it with a shoehorn which makes a very efficient gag if you know how to arrange it then we carried it into the diningroom and sent a man to dumoise the doctor telling him </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> him to come over at once after we had despatched the messenger and were drawing breath strickland said its no good this isnt any doctors work i also knew that he spoke the truth the beasts head was free and it threw it about from side to side any one entering </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> entering the room would have believed that we were curing a wolfs pelt that was the most loathsome accessory of all strickland sat with his chin in the heel of his fist watching the beast as it wriggled on the ground but saying nothing the shirt had been torn open in </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> in the scuffle and showed the black rosette mark on the left breast it stood out like a blister in the silence of the watching we heard something without mewing like a sheotter we both rose to our feet and i answer for myself not strickland felt sickactually and physically sick </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> sick we told each other as did the men in pinafore that it was the cat dumoise arrived and i never saw a little man so unprofessionally shocked he said that it was a heartrending case of hydrophobia and that nothing could be done at least any palliative measures would only </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> only prolong the agony the beast was foaming at the mouth fleete as we told dumoise had been bitten by dogs once or twice any man who keeps half a dozen terriers must expect a nip now and again dumoise could offer no help he could only certify that fleete was </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was dying of hydrophobia the beast was then howling for it had managed to spit out the shoehorn dumoise said that he would be ready to certify to the cause of death and that the end was certain he was a good little man and he offered to remain with us </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> us but strickland refused the kindness he did not wish to poison dumoises new year he would only ask him not to give the real cause of fleetes death to the public so dumoise left deeply agitated and as soon as the noise of the cartwheels had died away strickland told </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> told me in a whisper his suspicions they were so wildly improbable that he dared not say them out aloud and i who entertained all stricklands beliefs was so ashamed of owning to them that i pretended to disbelieve even if the silver man had bewtiched fleete for polluting the image </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> image of hanuman the punishment could not have fallen so quickly as i was whispering this the cry outside the house rose again and the beast fell into a fresh paroxysm of struggling till we were afraid that the thongs that held it would give way watch said strickland if this </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> this happens six times i shall take the law into my own hands i order you to help me he went into his room and came out in a few minutes with the barrels of an old shotgun a piece of fishingline some thick cord and his heavy wooden bedstead i </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> i reported that the convulsions had followed the cry by two seconds in each case and the beast seemed perceptibly weaker strickland muttered but he cant take away the life he cant take away the life i said though i knew that i was arguing against myself it may be a </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> a cat it must be a cat if the silver man is responsible why does he dare to come here strickland arranged the wood on the hearth put the gunbarrels into the glow of the fire spread the twine on the table and broke a walking stick in two there was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was one yard of fishing line gut lapped with wire such as is used for mahseerfishing and he tied the two ends together in a loop then he said how can we catch him he must be taken alive and unhurt i said that we must trust in providence and go </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> go out softly with polosticks into the shrubbery at the front of the house the man or animal that made the cry was evidently moving round the house as regularly as a nightwatchman we could wait in the bushes till he came by and knock him over strickland accepted this suggestion </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> suggestion and we slipped out from a bathroom window into the front verandah and then across the carriage drive into the bushes in the moonlight we could see the leper coming round the corner of the house he was perfectly naked and from time to time he mewed and stopped to </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> to dance with his shadow it was an unattractive sight and thinking of poor fleete brought to such degradation by so foul a creature i put away all my doubts and resolved to help strickland from the heated gunbarrels to the loop of twinefrom the loins to the head and back </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> back againwith all tortures that might be needful the leper halted in the front porch for a moment and we jumped out on him with the sticks he was wonderfully strong and we were afraid that he might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him we had an idea </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> idea that lepers were frail creatures but this proved to be incorrect strickland knocked his legs from under him and i put my foot on his neck he mewed hideously and even through my ridingboots i could feel that his flesh was not the flesh of a clean man he struck </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> struck at us with his hand and feetstumps we looped the lash of a dogwhip round him under the armpits and dragged him backwards into the hall and so into the diningroom where the beast lay there we tied him with trunkstraps he made no attempt to escape but mewed when </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> when we confronted him with the beast the scene was beyond description the beast doubled backwards into a bow as though he had been poisoned with strychnine and moaned in the most pitiable fashion several other things happened also but they cannot be put down here i think i was right </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> right said strickland now we will ask him to cure this case but the leper only mewed strickland wrapped a towel round his hand and took the gunbarrels out of the fire i put the half of the broken walking stick through the loop of fishingline and buckled the leper comfortably </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> comfortably to stricklands bedstead i understood then how men and women and little children can endure to see a witch burnt alive for the beast was moaning on the floor and though the silver man had no face you could see horrible feelings passing through the slab that took its place </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> place exactly as waves of heat play across redhot irongunbarrels for instance strickland shaded his eyes with his hands for a moment and we got to work this part is not to be printed the dawn was beginning to break when the leper spoke his mewings had not been satisfactory up </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> up to that point the beast had fainted from exhaustion and the house was very still we unstrapped the leper and told him to take away the evil spirit he crawled to the beast and laid his hand upon the left breast that was all then he fell face down and </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> and whined drawing in his breath as he did so we watched the face of the beast and saw the soul of fleete coming back into the eyes then a sweat broke out on the forehead and the eyesthey were human eyesclosed we waited for an hour but fleete still slept </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> slept we carried him to his room and bade the leper go giving him the bedstead and the sheet on the bedstead to cover his nakedness the gloves and the towels with which we had touched him and the whip that had been hooked round his body he put the sheet </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> sheet about him and went out into the early morning without speaking or mewing strickland wiped his face and sat down a nightgong far away in the city made seven oclock exactly fourandtwenty hours said strickland and ive done enough to ensure my dismissal from the service besides permanent quarters in </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> in a lunatic asylum do you believe that we are awake the redhot gunbarrel had fallen on the floor and was singeing the carpet the smell was entirely real that morning at eleven we two together went to wake up fleete we looked and saw that the black leopardrosette on his </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> his chest had disappeared he was very drowsy and tired but as soon as he saw us he said oh confound you fellows happy new year to you never mix your liquors im nearly dead thanks for your kindness but youre over time said strickland today is the morning of the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> the second youve slept the clock round with a vengeance the door opened and little dumoise put his head in he had come on foot and fancied that we were laving out fleete ive brought a nurse said dumoise i suppose that she can come in for what is necessary by </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> by all means said fleete cheerily sitting up in bed bring on your nurses dumoise was dumb strickland led him out and explained that there must have been a mistake in the diagnosis dumoise remained dumb and left the house hastily he considered that his professional reputation had been injured and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> and was inclined to make a personal matter of the recovery strickland went out too when he came back he said that he had been to call on the temple of hanuman to offer redress for the pollution of the god and had been solemnly assured that no white man had </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> had ever touched the idol and that he was an incarnation of all the virtues labouring under a delusion what do you think said strickland i said there are more things but strickland hates that quotation he says that i have worn it threadbare one other curious thing happened which frightened </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> frightened me as much as anything in all the nights work when fleete was dressed he came into the diningroom and sniffed he had a quaint trick of moving his nose when he sniffed horrid doggy smell here said he you should really keep those terriers of yours in better order </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> order try sulphur strick but strickland did not answer he caught hold of the back of a chair and without warning went into an amazing fit of hysterics it is terrible to see a strong man overtaken with hysteria then it struck me that we had fought for fleetes soul with </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> with the silver man in that room and had disgraced ourselves as englishmen for ever and i laughed and gasped and gurgled just as shamefully as strickland while fleete thought that we had both gone mad we never told him what we had done some years later when strickland had married </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> married and was a churchgoing member of society for his wifes sake we reviewed the incident dispassionately and strickland suggested that i should put it before the public i cannot myself see that this step is likely to clear up the mystery because in the first place no one will believe </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> believe a rather unpleasant story and in the second it is well known to every rightminded man that the gods of the heathen are stone and brass and any attempt to deal with them otherwise is justly condemned
