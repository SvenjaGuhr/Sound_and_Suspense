 <lowSuspense2> some time ago i believe i had the pleasure of telling you the story of an adventure which </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> which happened to a friend of mine by the name of dennistoun during his pursuit of objects of art for the museum at cambridge he did not publish his experiences very widely upon his return to england but they could not fail to become known to </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> to a good many of his friends and among others to the gentleman who at that time presided over an art museum at another university it was to be expected that the story should make a considerable impression on the mind of a man whose vocation </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> vocation lay in lines similar to dennistouns and that he should be eager to catch at any explanation of the matter which tended to make it seem improbable that he should ever be called upon to deal with so agitating an emergency it was indeed somewhat </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> somewhat consoling to him to reflect that he was not expected to acquire ancient mss for his institution that was the business of the shelburnian library the authorities of that institution might if they pleased ransack obscure corners of the continent for such matters he was </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> was glad to be obliged at the moment to confine his attention to enlarging the already unsurpassed collection of english topographical drawings and engravings possessed by his museum yet as it turned out even a department so homely and familiar as this may have its dark </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> dark corners and to one of these mr williams was unexpectedly introduced those who have taken even the most limited interest in the acquisition of topographical pictures are aware that there is one london dealer whose aid is indispensable to their researches mr j w britnell </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> britnell publishes at short intervals very admirable catalogues of a large and constantly changing stock of engravings plans and old sketches of mansions churches and towns in england and wales these catalogues were of course the abc of his subject to mr williams but as his </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> his museum already contained an enormous accumulation of topographical pictures he was a regular rather than a copious buyer and he rather looked to mr britnell to fill up gaps in the rank and file of his collection than to supply him with rarities now in </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> in february of last year there appeared upon mr williamss desk at the museum a catalogue from mr britnells emporium and accompanying it was a typewritten communication from the dealer himself this latter ran as follows dear sir we beg to call your attention to no </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> no 978 in our accompanying catalogue which we shall be glad to send on approval yours faithfully j w britnell to turn to no 978 in the accompanying catalogue was with mr williams as he observed to himself the work of a moment and in the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> the place indicated he found the following entry 978unknown interesting mezzotint view of a manorhouse early part of the century 15 by 10 inches black frame 2 2s it was not specially exciting and the price seemed high however as mr britnell who knew his business </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> business and his customer seemed to set store by it mr williams wrote a postcard asking for the article to be sent on approval along with some other engravings and sketches which appeared in the same catalogue and so he passed without much excitement of anticipation </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> anticipation to the ordinary labours of the day a parcel of any kind always arrives a day later than you expect it and that of mr britnell proved as i believe the right phrase goes no exception to the rule it was delivered at the museum </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> museum by the afternoon post of saturday after mr williams had left his work and it was accordingly brought round to his rooms in college by the attendant in order that he might not have to wait over sunday before looking through it and returning such </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> such of the contents as he did not propose to keep and here he found it when he came in to tea with a friend the only item with which i am concerned was the rather large blackframed mezzotint of which i have already quoted the </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> the short description given in mr britnells catalogue some more details of it will have to be given though i cannot hope to put before you the look of the picture as clearly as it is present to my own eye very nearly the exact duplicate </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> duplicate of it may be seen in a good many old inn parlours or in the passages of undisturbed country mansions at the present moment it was a rather indifferent mezzotint and an indifferent mezzotint is perhaps the worst form of engraving known it presented a </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> a fullface view of a not very large manorhouse of the last century with three rows of plain sashed windows with rusticated masonry about them a parapet with balls or vases at the angles and a small portico in the centre on either side were trees </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> trees and in front a considerable expanse of lawn the legend a w f sculpsit was engraved on the narrow margin and there was no further inscription the whole thing gave the impression that it was the work of an amateur what in the world mr </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> mr britnell could mean by affixing the price of 2 2s to such an object was more than mr williams could imagine he turned it over with a good deal of contempt upon the back was a paper label the lefthand half of which had been </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> been torn off all that remained were the ends of two lines of writing the first had the lettersngley hall the secondssex it would perhaps be just worth while to identify the place represented which he could easily do with the help of a gazetteer and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> and then he would send it back to mr britnell with some remarks reflecting upon the judgement of that gentleman he lighted the candles for it was now dark made the tea and supplied the friend with whom he had been playing golf for i believe </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> believe the authorities of the university i write of indulge in that pursuit by way of relaxation and tea was taken to the accompaniment of a discussion which golfing persons can imagine for themselves but which the conscientious writer has no right to inflict upon any </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> any nongolfing persons the conclusion arrived at was that certain strokes might have been better and that in certain emergencies neither player had experienced that amount of luck which a human being has a right to expect it was now that the friendlet us call him </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> him professor binkstook up the framed engraving and said whats this place williams just what i am going to try to find out said williams going to the shelf for a gazetteer look at the back somethingley hall either in sussex or essex half the names </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> names gone you see you dont happen to know it i suppose its from that man britnell i suppose isnt it said binks is it for the museum well i think i should buy it if the price was five shillings said williams but for some </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> some unearthly reason he wants two guineas for it i cant conceive why its a wretched engraving and there arent even any figures to give it life its not worth two guineas i should think said binks but i dont think its so badly done the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the moonlight seems rather good to me and i should have thought there were figures or at least a figure just on the edge in front lets look said williams well its true the light is rather cleverly given wheres your figure oh yes just the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> the head in the very front of the picture and indeed there washardly more than a black blot on the extreme edge of the engravingthe head of a man or woman a good deal muffled up the back turned to the spectator and looking towards the </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> the house williams had not noticed it before still he said though its a cleverer thing than i thought i cant spend two guineas of museum money on a picture of a place i dont know professor binks had his work to do and soon went </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> went and very nearly up to hall time williams was engaged in a vain attempt to identify the subject of his picture if the vowel before the ng had only been left it would have been easy enough he thought but as it is the name </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> name may be anything from guestingley to langley and there are many more names ending like this than i thought and this rotten book has no index of terminations hall in mr williamss college was at seven it need not be dwelt upon the less so </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> so as he met there colleagues who had been playing golf during the afternoon and words with which we have no concern were freely bandied across the tablemerely golfing words i would hasten to explain i suppose an hour or more to have been spent in </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> in what is called commonroom after dinner later in the evening some few retired to williamss rooms and i have little doubt that whist was played and tobacco smoked during a lull in these operations williams picked up the mezzotint from the table without looking at </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> at it and handed it to a person mildly interested in art telling him where it had come from and the other particulars which we already know the gentleman took it carelessly looked at it then said in a tone of some interest its really a </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> a very good piece of work williams it has quite a feeling of the romantic period the light is admirably managed it seems to me and the figure though its rather too grotesque is somehow very impressive yes isnt it said williams who was just then </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> then busy giving whisky and soda to others of the company and was unable to come across the room to look at the view again it was by this time rather late in the evening and the visitors were on the move after they went williams </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> williams was obliged to write a letter or two and clear up some odd bits of work at last some time past midnight he was disposed to turn in and he put out his lamp after lighting his bedroom candle the picture lay face upwards on </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> on the table where the last man who looked at it had put it and it caught his eye as he turned the lamp down what he saw made him very nearly drop the candle on the floor and he declares now if he had been </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> been left in the dark at that moment he would have had a fit but as that did not happen he was able to put down the light on the table and take a good look at the picture it was indubitablerankly impossible no doubt but </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> but absolutely certain in the middle of the lawn in front of the unknown house there was a figure where no figure had been at five oclock that afternoon it was crawling on all fours towards the house and it was muffled in a strange black </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> black garment with a white cross on the back i do not know what is the ideal course to pursue in a situation of this kind i can only tell you what mr williams did he took the picture by one corner and carried it across </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> across the passage to a second set of rooms which he possessed there he locked it up in a drawer sported the doors of both sets of rooms and retired to bed but first he wrote out and signed an account of the extraordinary change which </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> which the picture had undergone since it had come into his possession sleep visited him rather late but it was consoling to reflect that the behaviour of the picture did not depend upon his own unsupported testimony evidently the man who had looked at it the </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense3> the night before had seen something of the same kind as he had otherwise he might have been tempted to think that something gravely wrong was happening either to his eyes or his mind this possibility being fortunately precluded two matters awaited him on the morrow </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> morrow he must take stock of the picture very carefully and call in a witness for the purpose and he must make a determined effort to ascertain what house it was that was represented he would therefore ask his neighbour nisbet to breakfast with him and </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> and he would subsequently spend a morning over the gazetteer nisbet was disengaged and arrived about 920 his host was not quite dressed i am sorry to say even at this late hour during breakfast nothing was said about the mezzotint by williams save that he </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> he had a picture on which he wished for nisbets opinion but those who are familiar with university life can picture for themselves the wide and delightful range of subjects over which the conversation of two fellows of canterbury college is likely to extend during a </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> a sunday morning breakfast hardly a topic was left unchallenged from golf to lawntennis yet i am bound to say that williams was rather distraught for his interest naturally centred in that very strange picture which was now reposing face downwards in the drawer in the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> the room opposite the morning pipe was at last lighted and the moment had arrived for which he looked with very considerablealmost tremulousexcitement he ran across unlocked the drawer and extracting the picturestill face downwardsran back and put it into nisbets hands now he said nisbet </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> nisbet i want you to tell me exactly what you see in that picture describe it if you dont mind rather minutely ill tell you why afterwards well said nisbet i have here a view of a countryhouseenglish i presumeby moonlight moonlight youre sure of that </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> that certainly the moon appears to be on the wane if you wish for details and there are clouds in the sky all right go on ill swear added williams in an aside there was no moon when i saw it first well theres not much </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> much more to be said nisbet continued the house has onetwothree rows of windows five in each row except at the bottom where theres a porch instead of the middle one and but what about figures said williams with marked interest there arent any said nisbet </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> nisbet but what no figure on the grass in front not a thing youll swear to that certainly i will but theres just one other thing what why one of the windows on the groundfloorleft of the dooris open is it really so my goodness he </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> he must have got in said williams with great excitement and he hurried to the back of the sofa on which nisbet was sitting and catching the picture from him verified the matter for himself it was quite true there was no figure and there was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> was the open window williams after a moment of speechless surprise went to the writingtable and scribbled for a short time then he brought two papers to nisbet and asked him first to sign oneit was his own description of the picture which you have just </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> just heardand then to read the other which was williamss statement written the night before what can it all mean said nisbet exactly said williams well one thing i must door three things now i think of it i must find out from garwoodthis was his </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> his last nights visitorwhat he saw and then i must get the thing photographed before it goes further and then i must find out what the place is i can do the photographing myself said nisbet and i will but you know it looks very much </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> much as if we were assisting at the working out of a tragedy somewhere the question is has it happened already or is it going to come off you must find out what the place is yes he said looking at the picture again i expect </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> expect youre right he has got in and if i dont mistake therell be the devil to pay in one of the rooms upstairs ill tell you what said williams ill take the picture across to old green this was the senior fellow of the college </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> college who had been bursar for many years its quite likely hell know it we have property in essex and sussex and he must have been over the two counties a lot in his time quite likely he will said nisbet but just let me take </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> take my photograph first but look here i rather think green isnt up today he wasnt in hall last night and i think i heard him say he was going down for the sunday thats true too said williams i know hes gone to brighton well </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> well if youll photograph it now ill go across to garwood and get his statement and you keep an eye on it while im gone im beginning to think two guineas is not a very exorbitant price for it now in a short time he had </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> had returned and brought mr garwood with him garwoods statement was to the effect that the figure when he had seen it was clear of the edge of the picture but had not got far across the lawn he remembered a white mark on the back </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> back of its drapery but could not have been sure it was a cross a document to this effect was then drawn up and signed and nisbet proceeded to photograph the picture now what do you mean to do he said are you going to sit </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> sit and watch it all day well no i think not said williams i rather imagine were meant to see the whole thing you see between the time i saw it last night and this morning there was time for lots of things to happen but </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> but the creature only got into the house it could easily have got through its business in the time and gone to its own place again but the fact of the window being open i think must mean that its in there now so i feel </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> feel quite easy about leaving it and besides i have a kind of idea that it wouldnt change much if at all in the daytime we might go out for a walk this afternoon and come in to tea or whenever it gets dark i shall </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> shall leave it out on the table here and sport the door my skip can get in but no one else the three agreed that this would be a good plan and further that if they spent the afternoon together they would be less likely to </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> to talk about the business to other people for any rumour of such a transaction as was going on would bring the whole of the phasmatological society about their ears we may give them a respite until five oclock at or near that hour the three </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> three were entering williamss staircase they were at first slightly annoyed to see that the door of his rooms was unsported but in a moment it was remembered that on sunday the skips came for orders an hour or so earlier than on weekdays however a </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> a surprise was awaiting them the first thing they saw was the picture leaning up against a pile of books on the table as it had been left and the next thing was williamss skip seated on a chair opposite gazing at it with undisguised horror </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> horror how was this mr filcher the name is not my own invention was a servant of considerable standing and set the standard of etiquette to all his own college and to several neighbouring ones and nothing could be more alien to his practice than to </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> to be found sitting on his masters chair or appearing to take any particular notice of his masters furniture or pictures indeed he seemed to feel this himself he started violently when the three men were in the room and got up with a marked effort </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> effort then he said i ask your pardon sir for taking such a freedom as to set down not at all robert interposed mr williams i was meaning to ask you some time what you thought of that picture well sir of course i dont set </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> set up my opinion against yours but it aint the pictur i should ang where my little girl could see it sir wouldnt you robert why not no sir why the pore child i recollect once she see a door bible with pictures not alf what </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> what that is and we ad to set up with her three or four nights afterwards if youll believe me and if she was to ketch a sight of this skelinton here or whatever it is carrying off the pore baby she would be in a </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> a taking you know ow it is with children ow nervish they git with a little thing and all but what i should say it dont seem a right pictur to be laying about sir not where anyone thats liable to be startled could come on </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> on it should you be wanting anything this evening sir thank you sir with these words the excellent man went to continue the round of his masters and you may be sure the gentlemen whom he left lost no time in gathering round the engraving there </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> there was the house as before under the waning moon and the drifting clouds the window that had been open was shut and the figure was once more on the lawn but not this time crawling cautiously on hands and knees now it was erect and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> and stepping swiftly with long strides towards the front of the picture the moon was behind it and the black drapery hung down over its face so that only hints of that could be seen and what was visible made the spectators profoundly thankful that they </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> they could see no more than a white domelike forehead and a few straggling hairs the head was bent down and the arms were tightly clasped over an object which could be dimly seen and identified as a child whether dead or living it was not </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> not possible to say the legs of the appearance alone could be plainly discerned and they were horribly thin from five to seven the three companions sat and watched the picture by turns but it never changed they agreed at last that it would be safe </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> safe to leave it and that they would return after hall and await further developments when they assembled again at the earliest possible moment the engraving was there but the figure was gone and the house was quiet under the moonbeams there was nothing for it </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> it but to spend the evening over gazetteers and guidebooks williams was the lucky one at last and perhaps he deserved it at 1130 pm he read from murrays guide to essex the following lines 161/2 miles anningley the church has been an interesting building of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> of norman date but was extensively classicized in the last century it contains the tomb of the family of francis whose mansion anningley hall a solid queen anne house stands immediately beyond the churchyard in a park of about 80 acres the family is now extinct </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> extinct the last heir having disappeared mysteriously in infancy in the year 1802 the father mr arthur francis was locally known as a talented amateur engraver in mezzotint after his sons disappearance he lived in complete retirement at the hall and was found dead in his </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> his studio on the third anniversary of the disaster having just completed an engraving of the house impressions of which are of considerable rarity this looked like business and indeed mr green on his return at once identified the house as anningley hall is there any </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> any kind of explanation of the figure green was the question which williams naturally asked i dont know im sure williams what used to be said in the place when i first knew it which was before i came up here was just this old francis </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> francis was always very much down on these poaching fellows and whenever he got a chance he used to get a man whom he suspected of it turned off the estate and by degrees he got rid of them all but one squires could do a </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> a lot of things then that they darent think of now well this man that was left was what you find pretty often in that countrythe last remains of a very old family i believe they were lords of the manor at one time i recollect </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> recollect just the same thing in my own parish what like the man in tess o the durbervilles williams put in yes i dare say its not a book i could ever read myself but this fellow could show a row of tombs in the church </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> church there that belonged to his ancestors and all that went to sour him a bit but francis they said could never get at himhe always kept just on the right side of the lawuntil one night the keepers found him at it in a wood </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> wood right at the end of the estate i could show you the place now it marches with some land that used to belong to an uncle of mine and you can imagine there was a row and this man gawdy that was the name to </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> to be suregawdy i thought i should get itgawdy he was unlucky enough poor chap to shoot a keeper well that was what francis wanted and grand juriesyou know what they would have been thenand poor gawdy was strung up in doublequick time and ive been </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> been shown the place he was buried in on the north side of the churchyou know the way in that part of the world anyone thats been hanged or made away with themselves they bury them that side and the idea was that some friend of </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> of gawdysnot a relation because he had none poor devil he was the last of his line kind of spes ultima gentismust have planned to get hold of franciss boy and put an end to his line too i dont knowits rather an outoftheway thing for </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> for an essex poacher to think ofbut you know i should say now it looks more as if old gawdy had managed the job himself booh i hate to think of it have some whisky williams the facts were communicated by williams to dennistoun and by </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> by him to a mixed company of which i was one and the sadducean professor of ophiology another i am sorry to say that the latter when asked what he thought of it only remarked oh those bridgeford people will say anythinga sentiment which met with </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> with the reception it deserved i have only to add that the picture is now in the ashleian museum that it has been treated with a view to discovering whether sympathetic ink has been used in it but without effect that mr britnell knew nothing of </highSuspense3>
