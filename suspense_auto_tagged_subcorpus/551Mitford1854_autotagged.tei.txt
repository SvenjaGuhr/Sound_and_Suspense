<chapter>chapter i the great faem it was about three oclock on a xoyeni ber afternoon somewhere about five and thirty years ago that an old fashioned postchaise nth one solitary inmate went rumbling and jumbling over the wide verdant ocean of one of the great downs of the southern counties the traveller a lean gaunt bony man a good deal on the shady side of fifty bore about him in his acute features this shrewd eye a certain vol i b formality of demeanour and an occasional quaintness of phrase evident marks of his profession and did not need the blue bag which flanked by an ancient folio rested on the seat beside him to be at once recognized for what he really was a london solicitor there was however in the deep and somewhat sad abstraction in which he leant back in the carnage evidence of more personal feelings than those arising from professional interest and he started as from a painful dream when on arriving at the top of a hill or rather on attaining the extremity of a high tableland the postboy suddenly stopped his horses and touching his cap turned round with the inquiry tothehau sir no to the great farm and aroused from the dismal thoughts by which he had been engrossed mr langhton addressed himself to the contemplation of the beautiful landscape before him a most beautiful landscape it was the season had been mild so that the trees retained much of their foliage and had rather gained than lost in richness of colour the dark and uniform verdure of summer being well exchanged for the warm hues of autumn varying from golden brown to palish yellow with many a ruddy gleam from the old thorns and many an orange light from the beechwoods forming so fine a contrast with the emerald depths of the grassy valley and the purplish tint of the hills a thrice beautiful landscape one of those oases of cultivation which are occasionally found amid the great downs of the south of england and appear all the richer and more fertile when embedded in the surrounding barrenness and sterility the road wound down a long declivity b 2 to a village embosomed in wood with its grey eliiirclitower its pretty rectory its neat cottages and cottageshops to the old gables the beams stables ricks and innumerable outbuildings of the great farm climbing up the opposite hill appeared the magnificent demesne of atherton ilall the park paling overhung with gigantic trees bounding the road for upwards of a mile its stately lodges its waters lawns and woods extending to a chase whose wild forest scenery was lost in the distance midway the acclivity the princely mansion a fine specimen of the palladian architecture which prevailed in england in the eighteenth century with its noble porticoand long colonnades its broad terraces and flight above flight of marble steps stood glittering in the wintry light as if like the peacocks sunning themselves on the balustrade the very tnalls had a consciousness of their own proud beauty mr langhton had the familiarity of a native with the scenery and himself a man of refined taste never looked at it without pleasure xotv however as he gazed at the palace of the proud noble and the homestead of the tenant his musings seemed to become sadder a strange destiny thought he to carry wealth to one household and poverty to another misery perhaps to both well it is a lawyers fate and so thinking he drove up to the door there were few houses which wore more completely the outward show of comfort and prosperity than the great fame at atherton it was a large square substantial building with fine fruittrees covering the upper part of the walls and jessamine honeysuckle and china roses clustering round the windows the green court which divided the house from the road was gay dining nine months of the year with flowers and flowering trees and boasted still some lingering spikes of hollyhock a stray blossom of clove and scarlet geranium and bunches of that most fragrant of roses which is called of the four seasons the mignonette too and the violet still mingled their delicious odours people who sincerely love flowers contrive to make them blow sooner and later than others we see this in the poorest cottages and here was no poverty to contend with on one side of the court was that most affluent of all territories an immense orchard a perfect grove of fruittrees cherry apple pear plum and walnut at their tallest growth and fullest bearing behind was a large kitchengarden and on the side opposite to the orchard a magnificent farmyard a huge and indescribable mixture of riches and mud behind that came poultryyard and rickyard horsepond and duckpond barns stables carthouses cowhouses dovecots and piastres with alltheir inhabitants biped and quadruped feathered and unfeathered of every denomination they who talk of the quiet of the country can hardly have been in a great farmyard towards sunset on a wintry day when the teams are come back from the plough and the cattle from the field and the whole population is gathered together for the purpose of feeding i would match it for noise and dirt and jostling against cheapside and taking into account the variety of the creatures and the different keys combined in that wild chorus i should have little doubt of winning lord delancy the noble owner of the hall had most extensive estates in the same county but nearly all the parish of atherton was rented by the tenant of the great farm and that tenant was a woman mrs warner had presided over this land of plenty for nearly fifty years originally as the wife of the master latterly as the mistress and always with high reputation for hospitality and good management she was a neat gentle ladylike person with silver hair a fair pale complexion mild dark eyes a little tremor of head and voice and a slight bend of the slender figure altogether a most venerable and beautiful old woman her family consisted of a daughterinlaw the widow of her only son and of their daughter catherine commonly called katy warner a girl of fifteen katys mother was a round rosy merry bustling dame who having since the death of her first husband had as she expressed it the luck to marry and bury a second bore the name of bell to her for some years back the chief government of the house and farm had devolved and few women could be fitter for such a charge with a frame strong and active as that of a man a competent knowledge of husbandry a good judgment in cattle and considerable skill in parish impairs with a kindness that was always felt and a tongue that was often heard she scolded her way through the agricultural year from wheatsowing to harvest ignorant as a newbon child of the world and its ways except always the small bit of that huge rotundity called the manor and royalty of atherton it is probable that the very limitation of her faculties conduced not a little to her prosperity fearful of experiments she stuck to the old routine adapted to her capacity and trusted to the experience of her labourers men for the most part born upon the land who knew every inch of the ground and cared for the interest of their good mistress as if it had been their own everything throve in this female household from the flocks whose numbers were counted by thousands down to katys bees the parlour the common livingroom of the family was smaller than to judge from its appearance any room in that house ought to have been chosen perhaps on that account people who can command large rooms having a frequent tendency to use small ones it was a sort of excrescence on one side of the dwelling a kind of afterthought with a sunny baywindow commanding the farmyard from which it was only parted by a low paling and a slip of turf and giving a peep at the highroad a snug and cheerful apartment after all was that little parlour crowded with furniture from the good old ladys highbacked chair to the low stool on which katy whenever that mercurial little </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> little person did stay five minutes in a place used to sit at her grandmothers feet in the centre was a small pembroke table of dark mahogany somewhat rickety at the end a sideboard of the same material the drawers groaning withstands of spirits and bottles of homemade wine the top covered with miscellaneous articles mrs warners large bible surmounted by a cookerybook occupying one comer whilst mrs bells enormous workbaskets and workbags overfilled the other a beautiful jar of dried grasses katys property occupied the middle katys possessions indeed might be traced everywhere her litter living and dead cumbered the walls and the floor birds kittens skippingropes bridles riding whips and battledores were distributed all over the room whilst atherton a fat spaniel called flora lay basking before the fire two triangular cupboards occupied two opposite comers of which one was so crammed with closelypacked glass and china that it was dangerous for any unaccustomed finger to attempt to extricate cup or saucer from the pile whilst the other was filled to bursting with articles of daily call tea sugar lemons nutmegs and gingerbread fruit at all seasons and cakes of many denominations completed the array no one could enter that room without tasting the light seedcake dietbread mrs warner called it compounded from a family recipe a hundred years old or the green gooseberry wine famous as that of mrs primrose sparkling and effervescent as champagne it was the very temple of hospitality a sidedoor opened into a hall which might perhaps lay equal claim to that title a large flagged apartment with a wide open hearth and a heavy oak table on which business of eating and drinking was going forward all day long the materials it is true were somewhat different consisting not of such kickshaws as cake and wine but of solid beef in its most ponderous form of round and sirloin massive bacon and mighty ale all the comers and goers of the farm paid a visit to the stone hall and it may be suspected that they occasionally made an errand for no better purpose at this very moment it was the scene of a barter betwixt joseph stokes the old bailiff and factotum and a west country dealer bent to exchange a certain drove of horned cattle against a flock of mrs warners southron it was probable that the day would go against the good bailiff the man of beeves a seasoned vessel having declined the homebrewed and preferred to drive his bargain over a pitcher of gintoddy which was already making innovation upon josephs brain unused to such potations his mistresses the whilst were assembled in the common room katy absorbed by the witcheries of the aiarian nights a recent acquisition mrs warner nodding over her knitting and striving not very successfully to resist the afterdinner nap of calm and gentle age mrs well engaged with her female prime minister eachel in looking over a stupendous flasket of clothes the produce of the great wash such a flasket as might comfortably have carried the fat knight sir john to his immortal ducking in hatchet mead nothing but long habit could have protected mrs warners slumbers against the emphatic exclamations of the mistress at stockings mismatched snagged tablecloths and missing kerchiefs or the shrill defences of the maid through the stone hall scarcely noticed by its trafficking tenants jugglers upon a large scale and into the smaller apartment hardly less noisy nth its vociferous housewifery good mr langhton made his way welcomed as an honoured friend by all its inmates even flora rose lazily from the hearthrug to greet the guest who carried so kind a heart under so formal a bearing dogs are great penetrates into the hidden mystery of character when they wag their tails you may be sure either that there is no deception or that the deception is of the rarest and honestest sort that the wood beneath is of finer grain than the outward veneering flora set up her long ears and wagged her tail in his honour mrs warner pressed his offered hand katy skipped about him for joy mrs bell jingling her keys assailed him with a perfect storm of hospitality and eachel stood eagerly waiting to execute her orders he put aside her offers with characteristic decision he would have nothing yet he thanked her he had taken something at the last stage iso dinner no wine no cakes no fruit he must sleep at the hall where lord delancy had appointed to meet him he would take a cup of tea byandbye when they did at their usual time in the meanwhile he wished to speak a few words to mrs warner so the produce of the great wash was again packed into its huge receptacle which mrs well and eachel shoved with some difficulty through the door katy picking up odds and ends of clean linen as they fell from the pile rolling them into tight pellets and tossing them laughingly into the basket as the party disappeared pretty much as a schoolboy might have flung a ball at cricket vol t </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ii the misers will katy grows a charming girl cried the old lawyer when left alone with his hostess settling himself comfortably on the opposite side of the bright wood fire she is already taller than her mother and prettier than anything that i have seen this many a day that rosy dimpled sparkling beauty is become very uncommon in long don i suppose she owes her fulness of bloom to your country air and country freedom there is as perfect evidence of health in those bright hazel eyes with their long lashes and that profusion of shining i broth curls as in the glowing cheeks and ruddy lips and the white teeth which she shows as often as she smiles that is as often as she speaks she is sunburnt just now said grandmamma highly pleased and wishing to hear more praises of her darling not a bit more sunburnt than she ought to be as the party lady said of wilkess squint responded the old lawyer her beauty is only the richer for it how old is she fifteen last april a mere child yet and i am afraid a spoilt child wild as a colt untamed but good and kind and innocent and loving with all her pranks was ito katy that you wished to speak to me mr langhton asked the old lady recollecting herself not exactly although the subject on which i have to speak with you may greatly influence her future life did you ever hear of a relation of your late husband called eichard strange do you recollect him recollect him truly do i neither my husband nor i were so rich in kinsfolk that we could afford to forget one and this eichard strange was i think the nearest relation my poor thomas had he was his cousin once removed having been the cousingerman of his father ay he was above a dozen years older than thomas and must be old now halfway i should think between fourscore and ninety i should suppose he must be failing too although when i last saw him he was active and hearty one of those thin and wiry men who keep their strength long you knew him then yes i have seen him perhaps half a score times since my manrage the last time was about fourteen years ago before my poor sons death i remember he was uiucli taken with katy then a little toddling thing just beginning to talk who laughed and played with him as she did with everybody i have never seen him since but we commonly hear from him at christmas to say the truth sir langhton my husband who was as kind a soul as ever lived used to keep up the old fashion of sending a basket of country cheer turkey and chine and such like to two or three faraway kinsfolk in london and i have continued the custom the rather that we know most of them to be not the best off in the world somebody indeed told my daughter that eichard strange though he did look like an old beggar was quite well to do but she called upon him in london when she went there last year about the late mr bells affairs and found him living in a poor way enough a very poor way by her account though she never saw him in his own place only in a sort of porters lodge does he want any thing that we can do for him i wonder do you know him mr langhton i did know him as intimately perhaps as he chose to be known by anybody he is dead i was his solicitor i am now his executor and it is about his will mrs warner that i am </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> am come to you i am not afraid of overturning a mind so wellbalanced as yours did it never occur to you that there are in the world such things as misers that cousin of your good husband eichard strange has died worth almost two millions of money and of that sum nearly half quite half except moderate legacies to a few charities and the still fewer private friends that a man who passes his life in moneygetting can hope to acquire the half of this sum is bequeathed to the heirs of the body of his deceased kinsman thomas warner of atherton great farm to katy the only daughter of his only son to my poor katy 1 and in spite of the wellbalanced mind which had been justly imputed to her the good grandmother struck perhaps by a transition in the fate of her simple pet which sounded like the conclusion of a fairytale seemed likely to faint ay dear mrs warner you may well look astounded take a glass of your own wine said mr langton administering the cordial you may well be frightened it is a terrible destiny to be a great heiress but there is health of mind as well as of body in that brighteyed damsel she will have you to take care of her and in a far less important degree she will also have me and she shall also if i see cause for such a measure have the court of chancery added the good lawyer with a peculiar smile which with all its faults and they are many does yet extend a very vigilant protection over its wards a most comfortable protection to those who have heiresses in charge keeping off fortunehunters and rendering elopements and abductions unprofitable and unsafe ay we must keep off fortunehunters continued he slowly rubbing his hands with an air of deliberation as if weighing some important project we must keep off mortimer but as katy will have only too much money of her own instead of looking out ourselves for mere wealth we must select for her some young man for whom we can answer whose estate and position will satisfy the world and whose character will be a pledge for her happiness a fortune of nearly a million is certainly according to my views a great danger and therefore a great calamity but there are consolations even for that we must look about us or katy hereafter may look about for herself interposed mrs warner old as i am i have still some faith in a marriage of affection with that fortune and the prettiness you were talking of oiu little girl may make her own choice hem quoth the man of law again rubbing his hands we may help her though those lovematches of boys and girls are not always the happiest however well talk of that another time these are early days as yet for as you may well imagine i took care to inform you as soon as i had ascertained that there was no chance i may say no possibility of another claimant poor eichard strange when did he die that there is no telling he lived if such an existence can be called living in miserable dilapidated chambers in an outoftheway place called lyons inn i myself had never been inside his rooms until i went thither upon this business frequently as he had occasion to consult me he either came to me at my own office or appointed to meet me at some third place always contriving to make the persons with whom he had dealings whether they bought estates or whether they sold estates or whether as happened most frequently they mortgaged the dirty acres defray every charge possible my bills always paid by the other party were nothing compared with his meetings journeys consultations letters written letters received postage carriage loss of time and when every imaginable item had been put down he would add some unimaginable sum under the head of sundries a thorough miser was eichard strange elwes might have taken pattern from him and was that how he scraped together so much money no doubt he began by scraping together by mere saving that was before my time but in addition to his habit of hoarding which was a veritable instinct like that of a squirrel or a monkey he had immense sagacity in the management of money understood the handling of that delicate machine called the stocks better than any man on change never missed a good stroke never made a bad one trafficked in everything gained by everything lost nothing spent nothing so that on the whole i am rather surprised that he did not cut up richer mr langhton richer aye such will be the general feeling of the monied world everybody will wonder what he could have done with his wealth though to be sure we may find a good deal more yet for he has left us no list of his property and we have had little time to rummage there may be another million so far as i know we shall find out by degrees i must inquire amongst our great capitalists they may help us he knew them then knew them to see the respect paid to that shabby dirty old figure when he entered any of the marts where men of money congregate we are all goldworshippers in our great babylon butin this case they bent before the skill as well as the metal the amasser as well as the possessor of riches poor eichard strange sighed mrs warner and with all this gold and this homage because of his gold he died if i understand you right alone alone as he had lived the portress of the inn rendered him the little service that he would permit in his chambers always under his own eye for he visited nobody and received his letters and parcels at the lodge an honest simple creature sle was who in spite of his avarice and his suspicions had a certain pity for his age his loneliness and his infirmities the fourscore years and five were beginning to tell upon him fast she always called him the poor gentleman i am happy to say that he has left her what will make her comfortable which of course we should have taken care to do on katys account if he had not i mention it only because it is pleasant that ho should have done the right thing there are good points in most of us and they were not wanting in eichard strange though the crust at the surface was hard and deep but his death mr langhton tel me of that well on monday evening last as i was sitting dismally enough alone in norfolk street turning over huge masses of lav papers relating to another acquaintance of yours to whom poverty will be a sorer trial than riches to katy this good creature mrs barnes made her appearance to announce to me that mr strange was missing she came to me she said because he had once ordered her never to speak about him to any one else the nearest approach to confidence that he had ever evinced towards any human being he had not been seen or heard of since the preceding tuesday letters and parcels had arrived clerks had calledon foot and gentlefolk in coaches they had rung the old bell till the wire broke they had knocked till they were weary there was no answer to knock or ring no paper on the door no sound of life in the chambers once before he had been missing for days and had come out as if nothing had happened only pale and thin another time he had been gone a week when the paper on the door said out till six but then he had gone through the lodge and now she was certain that he had not passed what should she do sand you broke open the door it must have been an awful moment and mrs warner laid down her knitting and held her spectacles in her trembling hand it was an awful moment i took with me my partner james osborne and two or three other persons well known to poor strange called in the parish authorities and after a due course of knocking and shouting proceeded to break open the door we were obliged to summon locksmiths and blacksmiths the gates of newgate were never more strongly barricaded it was an awful moment and a most fearful sight the squalidness the sordidness the dirt the utter destitution of the misers home no sign of coals in the rusty grate not a vestige of food not so much as a cup of water and the poor owner of these riches and this misery one of the greatest capitalists of europe lying </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> lying in the midst of the papers and parchments which represented his enormous wealth shrivelled up in a corner covered with a rug which a beggar would have scorned dead as it seemed tome rather of cold and starvation than of sickness or of age it was a terrible lesson may heaven pardon him and good protestant as she was it may be suspected that mrs warner inmost thought was not very unlike a prayer for the soul of eichard strange mr langtons next words brought her back to earth again almost the first packet that we discovered was addressed to mo and contained the will i had given him several instructions for such a document many years ago and was not at all surprised to find that katy came in for nearly half the property you expected this bequest mr langhton and you wonder that i did not communicate my expectations to you i thought such a bequest probable eut who could answer for the caprice of a man so reserved and so little accessible to ordinary motives he might have endowed a college or a cat would it have been mise to have entrusted dear mrs bell with a contingency which her sanguine temper would have converted into a certainty and have proclaimed to every soul in the parish from lord delancy to jacob stokes in spite of the tears which had moistened mrs warners spectacles she now lifted her eyes with a smile in them which vol i d proved low thoroughly she joined in the good solicitors estimate of her daughterinlaws discretion then with sudden recollection she inquired and the other half of the property ay there is the real mystery of this will that eichard strange should bequeath great part of his money to the heir of his nearest kinsman with whom he had constantly kept up a sort of intercourse that for him might be called amicable is natural and proper enough but the other half did you ever hear your husband talk of a person called betsy brown in conjunction with his kinsman never said mrs warner i feared so there must have been such a person and the poor heart that now lies still and cold in the vaults of st clements church must once have throbbed with a quickened pulse at the sound of that name it is a sore puzzle charged as i said before with certain legacies to charities and to a very few individuals the whole property is left to mein trust for the heirs of the late thomas warner of atherton great farm and betsy brown formerly of weston her heirs and assigns such names too betsy brown there are a thousand elizabeth browns weston there area hundred weston none of the few people who knew my poor client personally as a man not as a trafficker in loans and consols none of these and they are few can give me the slightest indication as to the person designated i must advertise indeed i have already given orders to that effect and set the parish clerks to work ransacking their registers if there had but been spinster tacked to the end so that one might have made sure of its being a maiden name but there is not the slightest clue to the labyrinth luckily d 2 added the perplexed lawyer the uncertainty respecting the other legatee will not interfere with the payment of katys moiety and here she comes </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iii the heiress my queen low would tou like to bea great lady inquired mr langhton of the unconscious heiress using the pet name by which he was accustomed to address her very much replied katy every much indeed you are reading the arabian nights entertainments continued mr langton glancing at the book which amongst its other wonders had kept the little damsel quiet tuning the whole afternoon and which too fascinating to be relinquished she had carried off with her and still held in her hand you are reading the arabian nights what would you say to a good genius who brought you the lamp of aladdin even though he should put on the form of a gaunt old lawyer ah but there are no such good geniuses now exclaimed katy does she dare to tell me that ask your grandmamma mrs warners smile a little puzzled katy eat all events rejoined she there are no such lamps nowadays as the lamp of aladdin no wonderful lamps that can summon slaves and build palaces do not make too sure of that either returned her friend for my part i have always observed that money provided there be but enough of it can command as many slaves and build as many palaces as any old lamp of them all and then yielding to the natural curiosity of katy and the eager questioning of her mother mr langhton for the second time poured forth his marvellous tale mrs bell intent on hospitable cares and thoroughly persuaded that her guest had had no dinner had entered the room at the very moment of this little dialogue heading a procession of servingmaidens bearing every sort of refreshment sweet and savoury that could be forced into the service of the teatable and was just arranging her stores of homemade dainties hotbuttered cake ham sausages kidneys porkpies eggs and honeycomb when mr langhtons story assent to useherown expression all their wits a woolgathering the result was a scene of disorder rarely witnessed in that orderly house the teacaddy fell fiom its mistresss grasp upon the floor the teakettle in eachels trembling hands for eachel had helped to spoil katy from the time she was a month old first sopped the buttered cake and then halfdeluged the teatray whilst the coffeepot wielded by the rosycheeked sally had wellnigh spilt its boiling contents on that pet of pets the fat spaniel flora who too lazy to get out of the way and accustomed to the observance of all around her looked up astonished at the general confusion mrs warner however by this time recovered from her emotion vindicated mr langhtons opinion of her calmness by assuming the direction of the teatable another hot cake made its appearance and the conversation resumed its desultory course a dozen such surprises would not have silenced mrs bell i am sure said she that this great fortune all comes from my having carried katy when we were in london last year to see mr strange at that place vrhich he called an inn but whch so far as i could make out is not an inn at all that visit was the cause of this good luck the will is dated twenty years ago observed mr langhton never mind that persisted she what does the date signify i am quite sure that our visit did it all but at first to be sure he seemed rather put out by being called down to that little place of a lodge and seemed to doubt if we were really his cousins from atherton till i showed him a great basket with a michaelmas goose and a turkey and chine and some lean meats ah quoth mr langhton so he recognised them yes and desired that when we sent up a hamper at christmas we should put in some turnips and carrots to eat with the chine and plenty of sweet herbs to stuff the turkey and above all he charged us not to forget to pay the porterage as well as the carriage he was willing to remove any doubts that you might entertain respecting his identity did he say nothing to my little queen here he seemed mightily taken with her replied the good mother chucked her under the chin and desired her to give him a kiss that was less peculiar observed the old lawyer many a man might have made that request and have invented the relationship on purpose i did not kiss him though interrupted katy raising her head from her grandmothers lap as she sate leaning against her knee he was mightily taken with her nevertheless resumed mrs bell rand fumbled for a long time in those ragged pockets of his to find a halfpenny to give her i have kept it myself continued she fumbling in her turn in a huge pocket which sent forth a jingling sound of many keys mixed with thimbles scissors knives slatepencils a small padlock a string of buttons and money of all denominations the treasure in question the misers gift was carefully hoarded in an oldfashioned housewife i have kept it said she partly as a curiosity partly for luck you see theres a hole in it katys so careless that i was afraid to trust it with her for fear of her losing it or giving it to the first beggar she met and you see how right i was and what luck it has </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> has brought her after all the poor old halfpenny cried katy again looking up you will give it tome now dear mamma will you not no fear that i should lose it now i shall keep it as long as i live in memory of one who meant me so kindly and yet it will be very bad luck if this legacy takes me from you grand mamma and from dear atherton but the legacy will neither take you from atherton or from grand mamma i am your guardian and your dear grandmamma will be joined with me in the trust and she and your good mother will receive a large allowance for taking care of you ah how good they have always been what care they have taken of me when i was nothing but a trouble to them exclaimed the heiress and now i must be going what shall i send you from london think what you want oh i have never wanted anything in all my life then you have been happier than most people said the lawyer but think again if you want nothing for yourself do not you want something for others your good mamma does she want nothing added he in a low voice the colour rose in katys cheek let me whisper in your ear mr langhton its a secret could you do you think get in london foui great

bonnets crushed and slippers lost said the grandmother smiling i am suie it was all the fault of her own two sons resumed mrs bell there is not so rude a boy as charles glenham in all atherton harry

hers a bad example a bad example let her look at home if katy does get into a scrape now and then whose fault is it i wonder when she happened to be riding jacob stokess donkey and the animal put his fore feet into a ditch and sent her over his head was not it because charles glenham started out of the opposite hedge blowing a cowhorn but ilany picked me up quoth katy and when lord delancy caught her in our orchard perched in the middle of a cheitytree was not it because master charley had carried off the ladder any helped me down mamma remember that well of course a great lad just going to

nothing to say to them and now i must be off to the hall farewell dear lady goodbye my queen vol i </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iv the lawyer stephen langhton was as the reader will have gathered from the preceding pages a great london solicitor forty years before he had left this very village of atherton of which his father was rector to join his uncle the head of an eminent firm in norfolk street strand there as clerk as partner and as successor he had remained ever since an old bachelor like his predecessor and like him uniting considerable taste and talent to unblemished integrity and much knowledge of his profession from him too he inherited a trick of making friends of his clients and taking a fidgety interest in their prosperity and wellbeing a peculiarity which contributed far more to the comfort and advantage of his employers than to his own since although in his own person free from all encumbrance to borrow a favourite advertising phrase he shared all the anxieties produced by unthrift heirs unmanageable schoolboys marriageable daughters and gullible widows and was indeed the general adviser trustee and executor of all his clients dead or living for those belonging to his native village he entertained particular affection especially for lord delancy whose property had been managed by the firm which he represented for upwards of a century and with whom although ranking amongst the haughtiest members of the aristocracy he had lived from the days when they were playfellows and schoolmates to the present hour on terms e 2 of fraternal affection and familiarity and now this interest was deepened and saddened by the storm of adversity which after having been gathering for years around his noble friend seemed likely to crush him to the very earth a longpending suit respecting a disputed will had just been given against him to feed this suit mortgage upon mortgage had been granted upon his paternal estates until those estates would hardly defray the securities with their accumulated interest in truth the property itself extensive and splendid as it appeared had been involved for many generations the portions of younger sons the dovries of daughters the jointures of widows had prest upon it heavily and as so often happens with large nominal estates each noble proprietor had lived up to his estimated rather than his real income there had been no vice amongst them no gambling by cards or dice no racing no profligacy taste had been their worst enemy one ancestor had restored the old baronial castle from which their title was derived in a northern county another had built the splendid mansion of atherton hall the late lord delancy had worthily filled the noble picturegallery designed by his progenitor and the present had furnished the library with equal regard to everything except expense whilst all of them had practised largely the unprofitable virtues of hospitality generosity independence and disinterestedness there were no placeholders or placehunters in their long line their very pride and proud they were alas based upon a scorn of meanness in every form in the present head of that old house a peculiar sense of locality a clinging to early feelings would mr langhton knew add tenfold bitterness to the bitter draught which he had to administer at atherton he had been born there he had wooed and wedded the beautiful wife whose untimely death had left him a bereaved and solitary man four lovely children of whom the youngest only survived had been born there and three had been buried in the same church with their mother the same church where their parents marriage had been celebrated every association of bliss and of sorrow the joy bells and the funeral knell boimd him to atherton latterly indeed for very love of that dear home he had resided there less constantly he could not bear to look upon the scenes he was so soon to lose but there he was expected this evening to meet his only son a distinguished young officer who </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> who although long absent with his regiment in the peninsula at waterloo in france fully participated in this tenacious fondness for the seat of his ancestors the home of his youth the thought of the unworthy possessor who would step into their place was the bitterest drop of all an orphan relation the son of a cousingerman of lord delancys father had been educated fitted out and sent to india by his generous kinsman those were days in which men of good abilities of a determined spirit and not too sturdy a morality still contrived to make fortunes in our eastern empire bold ambitious subtle and supple vivian delancy was the very man to succeed there he became governor of one of our richest provinces and wealth gathered round him no one knew how whilst still in the vigour of life he returned to england in the full hope for hitherto everything had prospered with him that the sickly lord whom he had left and his puny boy would both be dead before his arrival some flattering correspondent who had read his heart too well and wanted a favour had sent him word that they were actually dying and believing what he wished he expected on landing in england to find no obstacle between himself and the ancestral title half of his hope was fulfilled fais kind benefactor was dead but the young heir had shot into a vigorous man strong and hardy as one of the oaks in his own park and was upon the point of manage to the lovely but apportioned daughter of a country gentleman the young lord invited his cousin to atherton and with characteristic treachery partly from love partly from this old and wellconcealed hate for there is no greater quickened of a puny love than a deep hatred the indian cousin entered the lists as a suitor the fair helen unlike her namesake proved constant to the betrothed lover who had first won her maiden heart they were married but not until calumny upon calumny insult upon insult had provoked a challenge the result of which left vivian delancy with a bullet in his shoulder and a vow of vengeance in his heart from this hour the pertinacious and unscrupulous man pursued the ruin of his rival with a bitterness of determination a concentrated malice which became the ruling passion of his strong nature he followed vengeance in england as in india he had followed gold the rather that a remote but patient hope of attaining the ultimate object of his ambition the family estates a hope that seemed to grow by delay mingled with the lust of revenge and seemed favoured by circumstances an old relation to whom had he died intestate lord delancy would have been the legal heir had long promised to bequeath his great wealth to the head of the house not merely from affection towards his kinsman but for the purpose of clearing the family property and placing the old name in the high position which it had so long occupied in the country this promise voluntarily made increased the carelessness as to pecuniary matters which had been the solitary sin of the race the pledge had been renewed on lord delancys marriage to a portionless beauty mr langhton had himself drawn up the will nearly twenty years after the aged cousin died and a later will was produced bequeathing the entire property to sir vivian who had long since to his infinite disgust he who valued only an old peerage been included in a batch of baronets the whole household was in consternation no one had suspected the intention or the act and upon a closer investigation a paper wanting certain formalities was discovered rebequeathing all to his beloved kinsman and godson arthur lord delancy then when this paper was rejected for informality a third document was discovered the copy of a letter addressed to the solicitor who had drawn the second will directing its destruction imagine the materials for litigation in this complication of circumstances what were the actual facts of the case nobody could venture to pronounce no quarrel had taken place between the testator and his declared heii but they lived in distant counties the omission of a visit the misconstruction of a letter the mere caprice of age might have caused his change of intention on the other hand the known character of the claimant gave to all acquainted with him ample reason for a suspicion of foul play witness after witness came forward to give testimony to that effect and a missing valet was chased over three parts of the globe who could prove they said the writing and the delivery of the letter of which the copy had been produced the fate of this man was never clearly ascertained but it was at last supposed and probably with truth that he was amongst the passengers who perished in the wreck of a vessel bound to canada years had passed away in this miserable litigation anxiety had succeeded to anxiety suspense to suspense trial to trial and now after enormous expenditure the final decision had been given against lord delancy and the last lingering hope had died away for ever the termination of the great will cause was of course known to all parties but a far severer blow was yet to come suspicions had been awakened that the money so long and with so fatal a facility advanced on mortgage had been lent through a third person this suspicion was now proved to be correct and the real mortgagee he who after some months and some few formalities could eject the present occupier from all his ancestral estates from delancy the old northern hold and atherton the beloved home with their affectionate tenantry and matchless collections was no other than their adversary in the lawsuit the ungrateful and revengeful kinsman to talk over this painful termination of a cause of which he had always dreaded the result was vir langhtons business at the hall his hard features twitched ashe thought of the conversation he had to go through he had armed himsek with a choice copy of lord beers translation of froissart as a present to his brother bibliomoniac a tall copy in all the glory of its original binding with silver tips and silver clasps picked up at a sale fabulously cheap but he knew that talk as they might of the chivalrous old chronicler who seemed born to immortalise high deeds and of the brave englishman who seemed born for no purpose but to translate him the words might issue from their lips but their hearts would be far away the young heir too the gallant soldier arthur delancy returning to the home of his fathers only to hear that that home must be abandoned for ever arthur whom he had loved as a son from earliest childhood that accursed lawsuit thought the good lawyer and no stronger proof can be given of the sincerity of his interest in his clients than to say that his own predictions as to the result having been so completely verified never once crossed his mind as a consolation such were the dark thoughts which caused stephen langhtons foot to rest fora moment on the step of the postchaise which had waited to convey him to the hall ascertaining even in the midst of his troubles the safety of the precious froissart he sent in mrs bell and katy who had attended him to the door with eager hospitality and turned to take a parting look at the fanny there it stood with the bright fires glowing through the windows in parlour and hall the glancing lights within the house and the ruddy glare of lanthorns passing from stable to cowstall and from cowstall to calfpen with all its cheerful sights and rural sounds the very image of rustic plenty the view brought other speculations to the mind of our good lawyer i found this place thought he the abode of peace and comfort when i came bearing the tidings of this new wealth to disturb its tranquillity can content and wealth keep house to j gather can a child so rich so pretty so innocent and so confiding be trusted with that simple mother and that single j minded grandmother the world is full j of snares even this little world of others ton as yet she had seen nobody more dangerous than the lads of the rectory to whom she is probably only a gayer and a tvlder sister a playfellow or a play thing but how long will this last money and the want of money form half the trials of this life money and the want of money the approximation seemed to suggest yet another train of reflections as the chaise threaded the winding village street and passed through the richlyworked iron gates and between the stately lodges </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> lodges of atherton park even in a november night that fine scenery retained its characteristic beauty the moon almost at the full shed a silvery light upon the dewy lawns just touching the brown tops of the huge oaks that stood out as headlands or promontories from the deep woods which stretched up the hills on either side or flinging a dark shadow from the clumps of holly hawthorn birch and beech which mingled with single trees dotted the foreground just beneath the eye a broad stream was crossed by a low bridge of several arches and after many windings swelled out in the lower portion of the park into a picturesque lake halfway up the ascent the mansion a noble palladian structure of white stone lay bathed in the moonshine the long colonnades which joined the centre to the wings and the deeppillared portico with its rich corinthian capitals which swept yol i f down by broad flights of steps to the terrace and its massive balustrade gave back the light jom pediment to capital from capital to basement almost as vividly as at noonday a limetree avenue leading to other lodges just showed through a vista its higharched branches and chequered ground the faint odours of the decaying leaves marked the season and the peculiar scent of a group of towering lombardy poplars which rose like columns on a point of land near the bridge literally perfumed the air perfect tranquillity was the characteristic of the scene here and there a majestic swan seemed sleeping on the water or a single deer startled by the sound of the rumbling vehicle darted from its bed of withered fern under some gnarled and twisted hawthorn to bound across the lavn all else seemed at rest and the house when after halfanhours drive the traveller reached it might have passed for uninhabited such however was not the case the visitor was clearly expected at the first sound of the wheels a light appeared in the hall and before the postilion had rung the bell two servants flung open the folding doors and ushered him into the halflighted library where father and son advanced to meet him f2 </chapter>

<chapter>chapter v father and son father and son the two gentlemen to whom mr langhton was conducted evidently were in point of figure tall erect and stately they might almost have passed for brothers in face too the resemblance was most striking it was the same head in youth and in age the general expression was alike in both grave thoughtful calm and aristocratic but the guest soon perceived a peculiar look in the elder man worn anxious distressed which seemed to have added ten years to his age in as many weeks deepening the lines about the month and on the pale forehead converting into a permanent frown that which before denoted only pensiveness sinking his eyes deep under their brows and robbing them of gaiety and sweetness thinning and whitening the hair which three months before had been as brown and as glossy as the crisp curls of his son as he grasped the hand of his old mend and schoolfellow lord delancy exclaimed you have no good news for me stephen or youwould have come here earlier you would have come before the time continued he as mr langhton transferring the froissart from one arm to the other began taking out his watch i know it is the hour that i mentioned but with good news you would have flown nay my dear lord i am here as soon as i thought it likely that i should find you and my young friend and for my news that is no worse than it needs must be you yourself had little doubt but sir vivian was the real holder of the mortgages and now it is sure a sad shake of the head for a shake of the head may be affirmative and when sois always sad was the only answer a11 the mortgages interposed major delancy all was the reply he has contrived to buy up every security although some dated as far back as your greatgrandfathers time well dear father surely it is good to know this good to have no more struggle good to have done at once with a losing fight good to relinquish for ever a false position let the estates be given up i am ready to sign whatever papers may be necessary there may be such for i remember once this man and for that i thank him gave me credit for ratifying all that you had promised and advanced a large sum without waiting for my signature that at least proved him not quite a stranger to the blood of the oh my son my son to ruin such a son nay my dear father hear me out let all be done at once all given up all sold all paid surely the proceeds will not be sufficient to pay langtons bill exclaimed lord delancy pshaw my bib wait till i ask for it interjected the lawyer and of other debts than these mortgages you know proceeded arthur that you have wisely kept clear no honest tradesmen will be ruined by our ruin the proceeds of such personal property as has never been put in pledge will i firmly believe defray every just claim and leave enough for the purchase of such an annuity as will maintain you in comfort and in independence or if not let us dispose of my commission the world does not want ways by which a young and healthy man may win an honourable livelihood even in the midst of this new peace my own bad trade is not without its prospects let me go as a volunteer to india to south america wherever warfare flourishes and you will see that i shall prosper as others have done before me only let all be given up at once and trust me we shall be happier and richer than we have been during this miserable struggle against an overwhelming destiny only let all be given up to him exclaimed lord delancy suddenly pausing in the rapid wall up and down the room by which ho had been striving to throw off some of the imitation which shook the bodily frame even to agony yield to him the home of my fathers disinherit for him a son of whom the noblest of my ancestors might have been proud transfer to him my attached tenants my affectionate peasantry make him the master here where bred and fostered like a child of the house he raised his hand against the son of his benefactor he left this place vowing eternal gratitude see continued he throwing a tattered letter upon the table i found that scrawl the other day the very ink has faded as refusing to perpetuate professions so false the paper has crumbled away like this promises he left this house poor and abject he returned to it rich and insolent you disappointed him my dear lord he left you a sickly child never likely to survive the trials of school and the temptations of college he expected to find you dead and there you stood tall and stout on the point of marriage to the prettiest woman in the county poor helen she feared him as an evil spirit she disappointed him too he expected her to throw over the man of her heart as fine a young fellow in those days as arthur is now in favour of a rival as dry and gnarled and yellow as a bamboocane poor poor helen that rivalship washer first grief and his threats vague and worthless as they seemed then not only embittered but shortened her life your good father resumed lorde again pausing in his walk always said that as a child a mere child i had once offended this cousin then a youth and that his hatred dated from that hour for my part returned stephen i firmly believe that the hatred and the love were both subservient to the ambition he courted helen aubrey in the hope of preventing your marriage whilst he accomplished his own taking the chance of your throwing yourself into dissipation orin any event not speedily settling so that he might still retain his place as heirpresumptive to the title the duel had the same object in view whilst this affair of the will and of the mortgages is still a step in the same direction he cant get the old barony so hell be content with the old estates he has only to live long enough observed arthur and he may be the possessor of both for i do not think my dear father likely to marry and i am perfectly certain that i never shall phew phew whistled the old lawyer a most incredulous whistle it was live to my age before you </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> you make a vow of celibacy and dont be too sure of keeping it then sir vivian may soon resume his place in the peerage as heirpresumptive said lord delancy when the new owner takes possession of the mansion the old master will find room in the family vault dear father lord delancy and the one speaker led him affectionately to a seat whilst the other instinctively laid a strong grip on the travellingpistols which mixed with other loose baggage the servants had thrown on one of the tables nay stephen you may spare that precaution i had no intention to alarm you my dear son but more men die of a broken heart than we read of in the bills of mortality and to think that my own obstinacy and improvidence should have aided this mans villainy to disinherit such a son as arthur might kill a stronger man than i i will not listen to such words dear father nor i quoth stephen besides i have a remedy in my head do you remember arthur said his father the beautiful group of witchelms on the west lawn artists used to travel from london to sketch them there was a tradition that under them the family plate had been buried in cromwells time when what with sieges fires and sequestrations our declension began well the tallest of these trees was stricken they tell me by the great gale this equinox and falling luckily interrupted stephen against the tree next in point of size and nearest in point of situation was propped by that friendly supporter so that it has been found possible to replace the noble tree you know how clever a fellow lawson the woodman is and there it stands the goodly witchelm as firmly rooted as ever omen for omen my good lord mrs bell and katy to the full as superstitious as yourself went to see it yesterday they told me the whole story but now lord delancy shook his head as unwilling to accept the augury the son and the friend gazed for a moment on that other noble tree which seemed quivering to its fall their eyes met but stephens tone had lost nothing of its cheerfulness as he exclaimed suddenly apropos to mrs bells teatable where i heard this news you seem to forget that neither you nor arthur have taken any dinner and that i myself although fresh from that region of hospitality shall be none the worse for a cutlet and a glass of wine i have a project for you my good friends for both of you and for that determined bachelor master arthur in particular a project to propose and a story to tell but not a syllable shall you hear until you have taken some refreshment besides which this affair of the mortgage is in no such hurry some impertinent wit has said that luckily law always takes time to do justice now i append to that speaking in honour of the mistress whom i serve that to commit injustice law also takes her leisure the notice of foreclosure is not served yet and after that we have six months good let us go to dinner after which we can talk matters over calmly some very strange events have occurred within these few days events altering the prospects of some of these good folks at atherton not a little good folks of atherton cried arthur what can that mean our friends of the eectory ha i am glad to see that you have sense enough to be curious major they call curiosity a female passion but i call it a search after knowledge and would not give up my right to a fair share of so good a quality to any woman in the world however you must keep your spirit of inquiry under subordination for the present for not a syllable shall youhear until dinner be fairly past eelentings on the part of your cousin quoth mr langhton some two hours after the foregoing conversation when a few glasses of champagne had brought a little blood into lord delancys cheeks sales to some other party pshaw he has your titledeeds as closely locked up as his own heart no my plan has nothing to do with mortgages or parchments it bears a far more attractive form what do you think of matrimony arthur a man is never so near to becoming a bridegroom as when he has just made a vow to die a bachelor what say those excellent reporters the dramatists look into all the eases from benedick downward my proposal is neither more nor less than a pretty young wife the suddenness of this announcement startled both his hearers transferring to arthurs countenance the paleness which had before overspread his fathers you have often said my dear boy that you would do anything in the wide world to avert this misery and i fully believe you for all that lay in your power in the way of selfsacrifice you have done if you had not broken the entail to pursue this long law chase the estates here and in the north would have been preserved to you of you therefore i feel certain what i have to ask on your part my dear lordy is the sacrifice of a little pride of birth and alliance nothing else for besides vol i a that the money far more than enough to clear every debt is absolutely in my own hands the little heiress through whom it must be won is as good and as pretty and as certain to grace your old coronet as if she were a dukes daughter and then he told the story of katys legacy and how the thought of a marriage between the two young people each of whom had undergone so strange a transition of fortune had darted into his thoughts his strong feeling for both parties lent truth and earnestness to the manner in which he set forth his project oversetting with much dexterity lord delancys objections and opposing with characteristic skill the portrait of sir vivian lord of atherton to that of dear good mrs bell loud ruddy vulgar and fine as the mother of his daughterinlaw a picture from which the fastidious gentleman shrank with instinctive repugnance never mind mrs bell quoth our friend stephen ill answer for whenever speaking three sentences in your lordships presence besides ill get mary osborne to dress her that little woman my partners wife is a jewel she is to get a governess for katy never trouble yourself about mrs beu think of mrs warner sweet old miss warner fair delicate and simple as a female friend fit at this very moment to take her place in your picture gallery and katy think of her reynolds might have painted them both indeed they are exactly the pure english beauties that he did paint eemember though added he as they rose to take coffee in the library that i cannot promise my gallant friend here more than a chance of the young heiress but considering all things the hereditary respect for the family the g 2 habit of thinking atherton hall a finer place than chatsworth and lord delancy a greater man than the duke of devonshire remembering also the advantages of military distinction and military bearing to say nothing of other good gifts and above all considering the prodigious power of opportunity and of being the first to pour sweet truths into the fair ladys car putting together t say all these elements of success i entertain very little doubt of carrying off the prize a word with you said arthur stopping mr langhton as they followed lord delancy through the hall one word ingot if it be an objection replied the solicitor are you too possessed of the devil called pride pride situated as we are said arthur but this marriage which after all is mercenary this availing ourselves of a position which is totally changed of advantages which are vanished my dear father carried away by his notions of family dignity and by paternal partiality does not see this but you be quite sure that every particular of your situation shall be made known to airs warner before tomorrow night and be sure also that with her feeling towards you and my good lord the prospect that this wealth may prevent the great wrong that would otherwise take place will be one of the consolations for the dangerous change in her sweet childs destiny both she and mrs bell expressed strong alarm at the chance of her falling into the hands of some one who would look down upon her or teach her to look down on them they avill seek for nothing but high character in katys husband neither shall i and i never gave so strong a proof of my respect and esteem as well as </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> as my affection as when i selected you as the happy man have you any other objection to offer only my utter averseness to the marriage state averseness does that mean a fancy for another woman are you in love are you engaged no upon my honour i am as free as yourself so much the better if you had been engaged i tell you no but to marry this young giil merely for her money pshaw pshaw 1 a romantic scruple like that is an anachronism in these days leave me to take care of my ward look at your father four hours ago i would not have insured his life for a month and now the very chance of escaping from the venom of that coldblooded indian snake has acted upon him like the fabled elixir you too are fitted for another age with your hatreds and your delicacies but just think of him and of all the sacrifices you have made and do not render them vain by starting off at last sacrifice exclaimed he with enthusiasm i ought to be hanged for using the word in connection with the brightest and sweetest little rosebud that ever blossomed in a country garden and you ought to be hanged if you are not over head and ears in love with her before three months are past take the word of an old man who has seen a good deal of this best of all possible worlds and has had occasion to observe pretty often that in fulfilling our duties at the expense of our fancies weare generally sure to be rewarded even in this life would not any one think i was urging you to marry the tjrganda of a fairytale i dont care for beauty interrupted arthur i do said his companion in common with most men and you will be a person of a singular taste if you do not think her beauty of a very attractive sort now let us go to your father i have a present for him in his way and mine a choice old book picked up for a song i did not dare produce it before but by this time thanks to our project hell be able to look at and enjoy it is not this worth something master mercenary </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vi he irhxjn ting on his return to town one of mr langhtons first visits was to the abode of his partner mr osborne a clever man of fiveandthirty who originally an articled clerk in the house had been taken into the firm without money on the strength of his abilities and his character points in which the senior partner was seldom mistaken a year or two before he had taken to himself the questionable luxury of a wife and our old bachelor fond after his fashion of james osborne and accustomed to command his society at breakfast and dinner grumbled over a measure which threatened to deprive him of his company during many a quiet evening in norfolk street forethought he with the grunt of a deeplyinjured man hell be going home matters were not greatly mended when he found that mr osborne made of his young wife a universal authority and referee in all matters extralegal even when they seemed most unfit for a wearer of petticoats if mr langhton happened to inquire what did that de bry fetch at evanss the answer was ru ask mary if what can i have done with the dundalk mary can tell mary could get an authentic copy of the ban of the empire mary knew where to send for the score of the requiem the clouds began to disperse when stephen discovered that mrs osborne really knew those things of which her husband boasted and she did not and the skygrew quite clear when he heard from his housekeeper that his kendal pudding was made from her recipe and that his warm winter hose were knitted in the charity school of her fathers parish in short that she was not that odious thing a female encyclopaedia but an observing and intelligent woman who knew where to find knowledge and considered no trouble too great no object too small so that it enabled her to gratify her husbands friend shes a clever little body thought our friend and wil have performed my commission if anybody can and found me a governess who will teach dear katy to conceal the adorable ignorance which would affront this accomplished age and fill at the same time the part of advisergeneral at the farm to think that it should fall to my lot to conduct a whole feminine household i who have always eschewed the company of women and to have the disposal of a great heiress i an old bachelor of fiftyseven poor pretty katy i wish arthur delancy liked her better but hes a noble fellow and the love will come in time she cannot choose but like him she who has seen nothing better than the glenham boys and the clodhoppers of the village this meditation brought him to the tasteful cottage at chelsea where his partner had fixed his abode he found mrs osborne and lost no time in inquiring if her search had been successful yes i know such a person replied his hostess with rather more hesitation than was usual with her exactly such a person as you desire sewell and she has requested me to look out for a family in want of a governess well then send for her directly there is not far to send sir she is in this very house but she is my old schoolfellow and very dear friend and i cannot bear to think of her filling a dependent situation she is the orphan daughter of an officer her father and her only brother died shortly after each other her mother she had lost before and an aunt with whom she went to reside turning out that terrible thing a matchmaker here mr langhton winced a little and uttered an audible grunt so that the fair speaker interrupted her narration surely dear sir you have no love of husband hunting chaperons who hawk about poor girls for the highest bidder none whatever but as to matchmaking that is a different matter there are matchmakers and matchmakers as moliere sganarelle says of faggots goon with your story well finding herself put up to sale and her aunt indignant at her refusal of a man utterly unworthy of her poor honor wrote to me requesting me to inquire fora situation as governess any situation the more retired the better where she might earn an honest living and here she has been for the last three weeks during which time sii we have seen too little of you or i am sure you would like her you mean miss clive my dear i do hke her and i like her spirit she will be much happier with good mrs warner than with all the husbandhunting aunts in the world shell be the very person to form katy those soft gentle manners are just what we want at the great farm and she is so good sir said mrs osborne much gratified by this approbation mind manners and temper are equally excellent as for her accomplishments spare me the remuneration good sense good principles and good temper are what we want the fewer accomplishments the better for my little rustic the new fortune will be disadvantage enough do not let us add new knowledge nothing is so bad as an attempt at acquiring that which there is no time to learn it is combining pretence and pretension engage miss olive of course not as a governess but asa friend i give you carte blanche as to salary but dear sir i know her well and am confident that she will not accept more than is right and usual you will find her an untractable person on certain points i shall like her all the better how could this aunt of hers venture to propose an unworthy marriage to such a woman i leave you my dear to arrange matters for me contrive if you can that miss clive should be ready to accompany me to atherton as soon as may be after my return from buckinghamshire the good lawyers expedition to buckinghamshire was another branch of the duties thrown upon him by this executorship during his absence an artificer cunning in the misers paraphernalia of false bottoms and secret drawers springs that no eye could detect and locks that no hand could open disclosed in the deepest profundity of an iron chest a cavity filled with banknotes and bills at once more portable and more negotiable than the bulkier bonds mortgages and titledeeds which crammed almost to bursting the upper part of the coffer strange is the contrast of these yellow parchments and discoloured papers </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> papers ghastly representatives of wealth to the hoards on which our ancestors delighted to luxuriate the kingly coin stately with its crowned impress the heavy ingots of bettering silver or virgin gold the ropes of pearl the dazzling heaps of precious stones ruby topaz amethyst emerald sapphire diamond such were the rich sights on which the misers of massinger and ben jonson gloated those great old poets would have scorned this unimaginative age where mammon stripped of all his gorgeous accessories shows himself in all his naked deformity barely covered by a sordid panoply of rags in that innermost receptacle of the moneychest so cunningly hidden were two or three papers which seemed at first vol i h to have small reference to the cheques and bankbills by which they were surrounded their pecuniary value was indeed very trifling the first document was an old almanac of the year 177 the others consisted of two or three notes of which the writer was evidently a woman addressed to mr eichard strange and signed e brown a note of hand for twenty pounds bearing the signature of john brown and the rough copy of a letter at once a declaration of love and a proposal of marriage to which on perusal of one of the notes was a gentle refusal here was a curious episode in a misers life the rough draft of the loveletter was brief and characteristic but not eloquent true feeling always finds true words very real must that passion have been which induced eichard strange to offer his hand to a girl evidently without fortune and induced him to name her descendants the heirs of so large a portion of his riches after an interval of nearly fifty years the notes signed e brown were dated weston but that address which indeed they already possessed was the only indication to be gained from this love hoard the almanac at first appeared to bear no relation to the event but in the months of july and august were found small marginal notes such as walked in the woods with betsy bought a keepsake for betsy wrote to betsy and on the succeeding day was a final note summed up in two brief words went away our old bachelor sighed over those brief words sympathizing the rather with the suffering that the sufferer had abstained from all complaint even to that mute confidant the almanac how different might his life have been had that offer been accepted h 2 turning to his ovm business mr langhton felt that no fiuther revelation was to be expected from the testators papers advertising was his only hope indeed the moment the cavity was discovered mr osborne had multiplied advertisements thicker and wider in almost every newspaper in town and country these advertisements were as usual fruitful in answers the norfolk street postman bent under their weight and doubted whether valentines day had not come before its time every weston in england had produced its record of john or elizabeth brown some a john some an elizabeth some both here they were christened here married here buried the good lawyer groaned in spirit the rather that the indications were so slight that it would be almost impossible for the most practised and subtle tracer of genealogies to follow such a trail however as the buckinghamshire weston cowper s weston offered the nearest approach to the family group which he dimly guessed at a john brown hadng been married and an elizabeth brown christened there about twenty years before the date of the almanac ho resolved to undertake the journey unconsciously perhaps influenced by a desire to examine the scenery of the task a poem which in its purely english feelings its homeliness and its teachings appealed strongly to his sympathies and his prejudices upon this arrival at the little inn he found that it was already the object of no unfrequent pilgrimage old inhabitant sii quoth a voluble waiter mr cowper of course plenty of people who remember him hereabouts very shy sir but very kindhearted here stephen attempted to interpose a word parish clerk sir no use sir wont find mr cowper in the register gentleman came last summer and hunted it all through was not born here sir was never married and died many a good mile away poor gentleman not in the register i assure you again mr langhton tried to explain his wants not mr cowper sir not the great poet less me sir people of the name of brown yes sir ill ask directly would you not like to look at mr cowpers house meanwhile sir get you a boy in a minute all the boys know the way want to know about the browns and to see the old people yes sir directly sir plenty of old women sir know two close by sir who have lived here all their lives mr cowper poor gentleman was very good to one of them and so were mr harley and mr johnson fetch them su yes sir they shall be here as soon as you have eaten your dinner sir broiled fowl and mushrooms sir yes sii in a jifly sir meanwhile mr langhton having ascertained that the clerk could only tell him what the register told and that the cramped uneven signature of the bridegroom therein bore no sort of resemblance to the bold characters of the john brown in the note of hand did actually in spite of his disclaimer to the waiter solace himself by a visit to the house which the poet loved so well and which drew from him perhaps the most pathetic letter on record that in which he recognizes his own malady by the touching words i will forget that a letter from me can only be regarded as a curiosity musing over the sad mystery of that strange affliction the alternations of darkness and light the enchanting playfulness of the letters and hay leys affecting narrative of the long miserable years that preceded his death a story full of wilder contrasts and deeper poetry than any which the poor poet ever wrote our friend forgot how time went and found the little waiter much propitiated by the length of his absence and a glimpse of the volume which he carried in his hand dinner ready yes sir got quite cold warm it in a trice sii thought youd never come here without visiting the poets house sii a good deal changed but something left still sir thought youd visit the old walks and the hall sir talk of taking it down sii glad you came first got the old women yes sir see them nov sir

lay buried in the churchyard having died when a promising youth fourteen year old and a bittock apparently he was alone in his generation for to every question respecting his probable kith and kin father mother brother sisters uncle aunt or cousin every possible owner of the desired christian names she returned no better answer than a stolid no whilst her brisker partner was so deaf that she would hardly have heard a pistol fired at her ear could not read and all the shouting of the enraged lawyer and his ally the waiter who brought all his powers of speech to bear on the object failed to drive into her head the sound of brown or of any other monosyllable proximate or remote the old woman looked and was thoroughly mystified at last a bright illumination flashed upon her the one name of the place sprang from her lips ay sir of course mister cowper nobody can tell you more of him poor gentleman i charged for madame unwind what might be the exclamation that escaped from her hearer she heard not nor need we inquire never was stephen langhton known to swear before or since and if in that moment the words were naughty the provocation was great one thing is certain that flinging his tormentors halfacrown apiece he drove back to london determined for the health of his soul and body to eschew personal atherton 107 encounters with chattering waiters and stupid old women and to refer the inquiry to the geniuses of the chancery court or the heralds office who can track a genealogy for half a century through no clearer indications than a torn letter or a defaced tombstone the race

<chapter>chapter vii lct the news of atherton our story returns to the great farm at the moment of the discovery the news of katys legacy spread like wildfire through the village of atherton in spite of her mothers quarrel tndth mrs glenham the good grandmother had a deep respect for her pastor as well for his character as his office as indeed no sounder scholar or better man ever edited a play of euripides she fully intended to call upon him the next morning and carry herself the grand intelligence but long before mi langhton had left her lit tie parlour the story was patent in every comer of the place the eectory included indeed when we remember that rachel and her undermines the rosycheeked sally and dinah the plump dairygirl were present at its announcement the wonder would have been if it had remained a secret eachel half beside herself with delight could not help giving vent to her ecstasy to her old fellow servant joseph stokes as he sate gravely discussing his bargain with the dealer and thereupon between joy and gintoddy joseph was beguiled into the very worst exchange of sheep for home cattle that he ever made in his life sally the belle of the village communicated the intelligence to two village beaux who paid homage to her rosy cheeks a young carpenter and a younger blacksmith jointly engaged in repairing a plough dinah naturally told her tidings to the herdsman who drove the cows to the milking and the lad who helped her to milk joseph told bargemen ploughmen shepherds and boys and his little grandson jacob who had picked up the news from the very first without any telling at all to use his own phrase promiscuous like little jacob told everybody if verification were needed it was supplied by mrs bell herself who sallied forth from the parlour bearing a bottle in either hand followed by her daughter with sugars lemons bent on compounding a noble bowl of punch such a bowl as had not been seen at the great farm since katys christening at the eight bells at the defancy aims at the shop at the forge nothing was talked of that night but katys legacy and considering the general aversion which is said to prevail in our poor human nature towards the good fortune that alights on other peoples heads and misses our own it is creditable to our villagers to be able to record that they bore the glad tidings with fortitude and resignation mrs warners constant charity charity of thought and speech as well as of action contributed doubtless to this result it is difficult to speak evil of one who never says an unkind word of others but that which most conciliated goodwill was the universal impression of the young heiresss open hand well little miss is not so bad i know no harm of she i dont think she takes after her mother dear ivirsbell played in this interlude the part of alcibiades dogs tail shell not steal the bread from a poor creatures mouth shes good to body and beast such were the general exclamations and katy vindicated the justice of public opinion in atherton that very night for after stuffing flora with as much cream and buttered toast as that overfed favourite who had never in her life known the pleasant sensation of a little gentle hunger could be prevailed upon to swallow she rescued her own particular attendant jacob stokes from the dangers of the punchbowl and seduced him into the stable where they jointly committed petty larceny by opening certain bins of oats and beans well known to both and bestowing a large benevolence of these luxuries first on her own pony next on jacobs donkey formerly katys but presented to jacob when she and her sidesaddle were promoted to her present steed then indiscriminately to all the horses within reach of the accomplices after which they finished their evenings expedition by running down the lane to dame barness cottage with such a basket of provisions that the good woman declared that she and her three little grandchildren should not get through it in a week to think added she that miss should laye promised me a new gown that in the midst of all this grandeur she should recollect a poor old creature that can only pray god to bless her perhaps katys happiest moment in that first night of almost boundless affluence was this brief visit to dame barness hut the news reached the eectory after the zigzag fashion peculiar to country places and with the exaggerations and variations common to all places whether city or village the gardener to adopt his own version vol i i happened to cal at the eight bells he happened to call at one alehouse or another on most evenings and there he heard it was quite true however strange it sounded that miss katy had become a queen he did not know of what foreign parts but a queen she was and with more money than the queen of sheba neb it is just possible that the pet name bestowed upon her long ago by mr langhton had something to say to that accession of dignity mrs glenham laughed in scorn then the housemaid went for a ball of cotton to the shop and brought word back that lord delancys titles and estates had fallen to mrs warner strange it is to trace those rumours that float in the air like thistledown pregnant warnings of the calamities of great houses mrs glenham remained incredulous next the carpenter brought at once a new bootjack and the real story as he had received it from sally an earwitness the eectors lady faithful to her doubts began yet to suspect that some grains of truth might be mixed up with a mass of falsehood at last the eectors churchwarden an intelligent man and a native of atherton coming in to leave some papers confirmed and explained the intelligence he himself knew mr strange and was aware of the relationship he had even heard moreover of his wealth besides the quarter from whence the intelligence came removed all possibility of error mr langhton was the most accuiate of men one who had never uttered an untruth or made a mistake in his whole existence mrs glenham was astounded this i2 was the little girl whose influence over her eldest son the pride of her heart she had so much dreaded ever since she had discovered certain stanzas to louisa enclosed to her address and had observed that his walks and rides whichever way they seemed to tend on leaving home invariably ended at the great farm she had exerted all her address to keep the young people asunder her only comfort had been that the laura of his rhymes seemed quite unconscious of the ardent poets devotion and in all their walks and parties preferred the wild gaiety of charles she had expended all her skill and contrivance in parting those whom she would now give ten years of her life to bring together it was just one of the reproofs so often administered by events to om wisest plans and mrs glenham a clever woman somewhat tinged by worldliness but by no means the worthless fine lady that mrs bell thought her felt its full force in this mood she repaired to her husbands study there sat he kindest and simplest of men surrounded by his books in the midst of various editions and german commentators intent upon a muchdisputed passage in a chorus of the trades and very unwilling to be disturbed even if the house were on fire upon my word dr glenhara said his provoked lady when she had twice poured her tale into listening ears 4t is a great pity that you ever left cambridge you are fit for nothing but to be a fellow of a college and a greek professor it is a pity was the reply delivered with provoking simplicity a college fellowship is free from disturbance and care and to have succeeded person would have been a noble destiny i beg your pardon my dear i believe you have been talking to me continued he with retaining recollection and when he at last caught the sense of her narrative she had no cause to complain of any want of interest in the subject they talked it over in all its bearings and the affectionate manner in which the good eector spoke of the parishioners upon whom so trying a change of fortune had fallen so suddenly emboldened jvirs glenham to say </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> say ay now it would have been better for all parties if we had encouraged harrys admiration for our young friend her fortune harry is to be a fellow of a college mrs glenham interrupted the doctor now thoroughly awakened to the realities of life and asserting with a manliness which became him well the resolve of a most upright and honourable nature he has got kings and must follow his career at cambridge a career for which he is well fitted in due time he may if he see fit take a living and settle but as to the nonsense of which you speak the love and the lovesongs why they have no more vitality than the sickly autumn rose which you are twirling in your hand or the dead leaves which are falling from the great oak upon the window sill if i were not sure of this i would give instant notice to mrs warner as it is i shall speak to harry i would rather see him the husband of the poorest girl in the village than that he should take advantage of my position as clergyman of the parish and an old family friend to pay his court to the rich heiress it is our place to protect this young girl in a situation of temptation and danger not to betray her into an unsuitable attachment and now my dear go to your daughters and leave me to the tragedy which earned for euripides the title of the most pathetic of poets in all her life mrs glenham had never seen her husband so determined the only comfort was that being a woman who had walked through the world with her eyes open she had observed that in these cases a little opposition is no bad fosterer of love and trusted that her son harry might prove no exception to the perversity of his kind meanwhile the year rolled on towards its conclusion lord delancy and his son spent a fortnight at the hall before separating the one for his regiment the other for london the fathers heart was lightened and the daily improvement in his health and spirits cheered and comforted the young soldier before three days had passed her noble landlord had not failed to visit mrs waiter and to become as far as her shyness and the recollection of the cherrytree would permit familiar with the young heiress his air and figure and stately bearing made a good deal against the intimacy which he wished to establish especially whilst they remained in the little parlour where both he and the major looked as katy afterwards observed too tall for the room his lordship returned the compliment by declaring that poof airs bell was too broad for that small apartment and looked in her new mourning not unlike a blackbird in a goldfinchs cage out of doors matters mended and in spite of the season lord delancy took care to luie katy out of doors to visit her bantams to look at her pony and to show her a young greyhound which he had brought fiom the hall a beautiful creature of that peculiar hue which coursers as he remarked are sure to miscall sometimes yellow sometimes red she has no name yet what shall she be called miss warner katy did not speak indeed she had hardly ventured to say more than yes or no but she gathered a flower from a lingering plant of african marigold which yet retained its richlytinctured blossoms in a southern nook and laid the clustering petals on the glossy head which with unfailing instinct had already sought her caressing hand keeper were colours more perfectly matched the father was enchanted and even arthur smiled at the unspoken reply marigold by all means a capital name and see jiiss warner you have chosen her name and she has chosen her mistress you must not reject her the moment i can get away fiom london we will have a days coursing in the park see mrs bell how she lies down at her fair mistresss feet as if to take possession my father does not mean marigold to supplant my friend flora added arthur for flora with similar instinct had made her court to him that in my mind would be a sin the old favourite is sacred as the old friend but where the heart is large as i am sure yours is we can find room for new friends and new favourites mrs warner says that flora is too fat to keep pace with your walks and rides so marigold must be the outdoor pet whilst flora retains her place on the hearth and mrs bell with many words and katy with smiles and blushes accepted the gift an excellent excuse was this playful and graceful creature for frequent visits from the hall during which familiar intercourse lord delancy grew as fond of katy as if she had been already his daughter whilst an unexpected intimacy sprang up between arthur by no means so formidable a personage as he looked and mrs bell he could hardly prefer her society to her daughters except indeed as a person whom he could by no chance be called upon to marry but so it was that while his father courted katy for him he paid suit and service to the comely ddow with whom he laughed and chatted for hours together she repaid this devotion with interest there is nobody like the major quoth she nobody in all the world to think of my having been such a fool as to be afraid of him he has just sent this beautiful collar for marigold only look its exactly like a silver bit and hearken to the little bells she wont know where the sound comes from and her name and katys on the padlock a real dogs necklace katy you dont look half grateful enough not near so grateful as i was to you for that noble team of horses and their bells and i know what the major is going to do besides swell said katy more cushions than she chose to appear what only if i tell you you will say that i cannot keep a secret dear mamma if it be really a secret dont tell nobody told me suppose wel but if it be a secret i found it out i tell you suppose he has got a new horse for you and is going to train it himself what do you say to that katy listened and blushed like a woman then like a child as she was burst into sudden laughter clapped her hands and danced about the room whilst her mother nodded in triumph and mrs warner evidently mr langhtons accomplice looked on with pleased approbation so matters stood at atherton when its noble master left the hall </chapter>

<chapter>chapter viii the governess another fortnight brought a more permanent visitor to the farm at the close of a short december day miss clive arrived with mr langhton all girls receive with some trepidation that alarming functionary a governess and it is probable that she who causes the fear often feels herself a deeper emotion than she inspires under the peculiar circumstances all the ladies of the farm were a little anxious or to use mrs bells phrase more graphic than elegant in a flurry mrs warners head shook more than usual as she received the stranger mrs bell poured forth questions and hospitalities without stint or measure and katys cheeks always bright glowed like damask roses except a little paleness the governess gave no outward sign of disturbance she had suffered too much not to be perfect in the great lesson of selfcommand how do you like her asked mr langhton of mrs warner when the younger ladies had taken her to show her her own apartment and to adjust her dress what do you think of her i think she looks good and pretty the old lady hesitated ah i see that you do not neither did i at first delicate and graceful and elegant as she is to be sure by the side of that bright little queen of ours everything is dim but you will think her pretty byandbye she must be much better than pretty to have won your heart so entirely said mrs warner she will soon win yours of that i am certain by the way when she came in she was a little shaken she did not know till i showed her the hall that lord delancy had a place here and it seems that she knew him or some of his family i think his sisterinlaw lady cardonnel in happier days she was halfinclined to go back again the only weakness that i have detected in her is a shrinking from the recognition of old acquaintances you know she was an officers daughter and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> and lost her father and her only brother within six months of each other i told her the family was absent and you must contrive before their return to make her feel that she belongs to you we shall try said mrs warner and she must take us young and old under her wing for i suspect that the mamma and grand mamma are more taken aback by this great change than the heiress herself but this young lady who seems so simple and gentle with all her elegance will put us in the way before the end of the evening mr langhton had the satisfaction to find katys shyness disappear and to see her seated on her old footstool at the feet of her new friend do not call me miss warner pray said she i do not know myself by that name cal me katy must i call you katy was the reply and suppose i were to make a condition and ask you to call me honor honor exclaimed mrs bell honora is the real name not uncommon in ireland where my mother was born but honor has been my pet name my vol i k atherton home name and it is to the home name that the heart answers we used to christen children after the virtues said the old lady and it was a good practice to remind them of their duties ay said mr langton such names abound in those fertile records of manners the old comic writers not always to edification that very name of honor for instance has been immortalized in fieldings great novel but the puritans chiefly affected those appellations and from them the custom has prevailed amongst their american descendants faith hope and charity are common in new england to say nothing of prudence and patience we have a patience in atherton observed mrs bell the greatest scold in the parish patience pratt people call her her patty pratt and pretend that her name is martha but patience she was christened though the name has done her little good enough as her husband knows to his cost if a woman is born to be a vixen it does not signify what you cal her i shall hold by honor though said katy honor is a noble name mamma i love it dearly and the poor governess felt that her pupil was already her friend the stone hall opened into the front passage and another door exactly opposite led into an apartment of equal dimensions which cold dreary and formallooking in its stiff and scanty perishing its faded carpet covering only half the floor its dark mahogany furniture its small pembroke tables its chairs and settees covered with white dimity had yet in height and size and aspect all that was required to convert the dismal k 2 best parlour into the pleasant cheerful family room honor discovered this capability before breakfast on the morning after her arrival and discovered also another passage at right angles with the first which led by an oldfashioned glass door into the pretty court half turf half flowerbed which swept round two sides of the house parted from the kitchengarden by a yew hedge over which appeared rows of espaliers and groves of orchard trees a very forest of pear apple cherry plum medlar and walnut in the centre of the grassplot before the glass door surrounded by a narrow border of mould was an old sundial beneath which still lingered some of katys beloved flowers there knelt katy herself trying to compose a little bunch of such as yet remained small spikes of mignonette and winter violets and singing in a fresh round voice a voice youthful and blooming as lier cheeks words new to honor but which would have enraptured the heart of mrs glenham it was an old irish air to which with more feeling for the music than the metre these irregular lines had been adapted good morrow good morrow soft rosy and bright glow the clouds in the east laughing heralds of light whilst still as the glorious colours decay full gushes of music seem tracking their way hark hark is it the sheep bell among the ling or the early milkmaid carolling hark hark or is it the lark as he bids the sun goodmorrow on hearing honors step the singer paused suddenly and flew to present her little nosegay they entered the house together and when after breakfast mr langhton requested commissions for london and honor had by a delicate question suggested to mrs warner the newfurnishing the pleasant best parlour to which mr langhton added a proposal to convert the stone hall into a dining room she said to his surprise and pleasure be sure amongst the new purchases not to forget a piano ah you have relented in your own favour i thought so i have relented for the general good if you had been by the old sundial this morning why katy stop my queen for the little damsel showed symptoms of running away are you the songstress lnay i must hear you i will accompany you said honor moving to fetch her guitar and laughing stopping and beginning afresh they got through the stanza is not there another verse enquired atherton 135 mr langhton after due praise of the singer where did you pick up the song harry glenham taught me replied katy with the most open simplicity he wrote that stanza one day when we were talking of the lark flying upward every morning as if to bid the sun goodmorrow he wrote that verse to some old air and taught me to sing it and he talked of finishing the song some day or other he often does begin things and talks of finishing them harry is idle his brother says that all poets are so that it belongs to their trade hes very goodnatured though continued katy and i like him if mrs glenham had heard the tone in which these words were spoken she would have despaired it quite reassured the careful guardian who had begun to think that singing harry glenhams songs might put artlrnr delancys interests in jeopardy this discovery of katys musical talent was no small comfort to her governess who new to teaching had justly dreaded the invidious task of instructing one equally new to the process of being taught now the lesson assumed the pleasant form of amusement herself an accomplished and enthusiastic musician she had brought with hera goodly collection of vocal music both printed and manuscript and in talking over the books and playing on the guitar such airs as her young pupil wished to hear the hours glided by easily to both parties happily to one to the other they were too full of association to be without pain many languages found a place in this miscellaneous collection french italian german spanish even latin was there in the shape of portions of the grand masses of the church of some and to honors great amazement and a little to her amusement katy whose ignorance of all modern tongues was so complete that she had not distinguished one language from the other seized on a fine piece of church music and began picking out the words with a certain apprehension of the meaning and a sonorous english pronunciation which would have horrified the italian composer you know latin katy only a very little said katy producing a wellthumbed eton grammar harry wanted to teach me but i soon got tired and mamma said it was boyish and grand mamma looked ready to laugh so i left off the last time the boys were at home they read to me which i like a great deal better than learning lessons and what i like i recollect when i dont care for a thing i forget it here was another lesson in education scott and shakspeare were pleasant textbooks and much history and geography were conveyed to the mind in company with such thoughts and such creations as awakened every faculty in that fresh and healthful nature poetry above all she delighted in and poetry real poetry besides the facts it leads to is the finest form of truth so reading with her pupil singing with her walking with her talking with her loving her passed honoras days the graver and the sadder business of life held on its way christmas brought to lord delancy the threatened notice of foreclosure unless the mortgages were redeemed within six months separate notices were also sent to the several tenants on his various estates to pay no more rent after that period to him or to his agents the commotion occasioned by a proceeding so unexpected equalled that caused by mr strange s will it took a form of regret and affection honourable to all parties the nobleman so proud and even haughty with his equals had </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> had been as proud men often are most affable and most accessible to his inferiors living much in the country and amongst his own people he knew every farmer and every villager on his extensive property if he loved his old trees still better did he love the old faces an excellent landlord the farmers were sure of indulgence when it was needed and of justice rarest of virtues always the tradesman had custom the labourer employment the sick attendance the children instruction the old relief when they met after morning service in the churchyard there was a real and a hearty reciprocation of interest in the respectful bows and curtsies which greeted their good lord on every side and in the pleasant smiles and kindly words by which those rustic greetings were returned to lose such a mend would be grief enough but to lose him for sir yivian the ungrateful kinsman the treacherous usurper whom the old tenants remembered and of whom all had heard would be intolerable the storm of indignation was universal nobody could believe that english law could tolerate such injustice they thought the whole story a fabrication gradually this incredulity assumed a more positive form the absence of debt the regularity of payment the disbelief of the household and the quiet manner with which in accordance with mr langhtons advice the establishment at the hall had been kept up without increase or diminution looked very unlike the proceedings of a ruined man and the shrewd ones amongst them mrs gorham for instance who watched the words of the family at the farm katys anger her mothers fury mjs warners quiet smile and stephen langhtons scornful shrug might give a tolerable guess as to the manner in which the catastrophe would be averted so lord delancy on his return to atherton found little to remind him of his precarious tenure except an increase of reverence and devotion from all around him perhaps to a man of his sensitive temperament the severest trial that he could encounter by katy he was greeted with delight although to her exceeding disappointment for like other spoilt children she expected all her pets to pet one another he got no farther with iiss clive than a ceremonious politeness which she shrinking from him as from other strangers repaid with grave respect another subject of lamentation with poor katy was that great english grievance the weather a seasonable frost had set in and she longing to see marigold run was wishing for an open day as heartily as if she had been the whole quern hunt to comfort her lord defancy resolved to turn the frost itself into an amusement and to have a skating party upon atherton mere lady cardonnel and major delancy were expected on the morrow and on the following day mrs warner together with the other ladies promised to attend a close carriage was to convey her and mrs bell the young ladies were to walk </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ix the ice there are wintry days in england which have an indescribable beauty and this was one the pervading charm was the work of that great magician hoarfrost the morning had been misty but towards noon the sun appeared softened by a light haze which gave a pearly tint to the cloudless blue sky and accorded well with the perfect tranquillity of the landscape not a breath of air stirred and in the perfect absence of wind the degree of cold indicated by the thermometer was hardly felt there was however no tendency to thaw eine was everywhere the finest patch of moss on the irregular parkpaling the lichens that roughened the trunks of the great trees that overhung the road had each its net work of delicate tracery the tawny leaves of the cutleaved oak which still hung quivering on the lower branches were edged with its glittering fringe the old rugged fir the leafy beech the tasselled birch the bristly holly the purple bramble the crisp brown fern the green grass of the park all showed their own varied colours and varied forms through the same crystalline medium contrasting with the rich hues of the hollyberries the dark ivyberry dear to the woodpigeon and the crimson haws which the small birds love so well in the stillness of that woodland scene the rustle of a robins wing the dropping of a leaf from the bushes was distinctly audible thanks to the companionship of jacob stokes katy knew every bird that visited the hill or dwelt in the valley the note the habits the nest the eggs it is even likely that had some wicked enchanter imposed upon her the task of the poor princess in the fairy tale who was commanded to select each birds proper feathers from a heap that filled a room she would have found the labour possible a mere question of time so extensive was her knowledge of those winged tribes and so accurate her observation she pointed out to honor that most beautiful of british birds a gorgeous kingfisher as he stooped to drink at a little rivulet a tiny spring issuing from beneath the roots of a great beech which went trickling along almost hidden by coat overcoat of thin translucent ice until it was lost in the winding stream which after traversing great part of the park was vol i l merged in its turn in the wide waters of the lake now entirely frozen katys pockets were as usual filled with bread and biscuits which she crumbled for her feathered clients who tamed by the severity of the season were alternately attracted and repelled by their desire of sharing in her bounty and their dread of marigold who adorned in her new collar and proud of it as a child of a necklace gambolled round her young mistress playful and graceful as a fawn the frozen lake was a pretty sight with its wooded islands its mimic bays and promontories the grand old forest trees between which it swept away into the distance and the masses of evergreens laurel arbutus cedar cypress or the light weepingbirch or weeping willow of the foreground a beautiful sight always was atherton mere and on occasion of this wintry festival it put forth signs of habitation such as had not been seen there for many a long day on one of the points of land that jutted into the lake hanging oyer the water the lower part a boathouse and above a rustic pavilion stood an old grey fishinghouse half covered with ivy and creeping shrubs backed by dark firs and flanked on the farther side by two poplars of colossal growth and size columns of vegetable beauty the smoke rose curling from the fishing house prepared for good mrs warner incase of her feeling the cold too severe she had however preferred a seat outside a tent in one of the sheltered bays and as they approached the young ladies saw at once that the travellers had arrived a large party of gentlemen were on the lower part of the lake where a group of skaters and a number of country people had assembled lord delancy with l 1 his usual courtesy having issued a general j invitation to such of the neighbours as chose to join the sports upon the ice the pavilion and marquee being filled with i seats and refreshments for the gentry and two or three tents in the background amply provided with ale and solid christmas cheer for the villagers j katy always shy held back a little as they came near the lake she dreaded a i stranger honor insensibly drew her forward poor honor 1 her veil was down i but the face was calmer than the heart mrs bell and an elegant woman of middle j age advanced to meet them and without suffering her mother to speak lady cardonnel took katys hand people talk of children growing out of knowledge said she i have not seen those dimpled cheeks these six years but i should have recognised them anywhere and bending graciously to the govern ness she led the little heiress to a seat next her grandmother mrs warner always considerate of the feelings of others and therefore always wellbred said will your ladyship permit me to present to you a very dear young friend of ours whom i believe you to have seen abroad miss clive lady cardonnel bliss clive honora honor cere i it is incredible it is impossible i heard of you i saw you with the lynmeres and you find me in a far happier home said honor byandby i will tell you the story at present your ladyship must play the hostess and she joined mrs glenham who introduced her to the wife of a neighbouring clergyman and talked as people do talk of the weather and the hoar frost and the park and the lake everything </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense4> everything except that of which she was thinking at last lady cardonnel had disposed of her guests some walked into the pavilion some more daring ventured on the ice mrs warner wrapped in fur cloaks remained in her old seat talking over schools of industry with the good eector whose secret thoughts ever and anon wandered away to thetroades and the matchless wailing of those trojan women katy escorted by lord delancy and accompanied by her mother tripped gaily on to join the skaters occasionally tempted from her path by the less aristocratic amufcxent offered by a troop of sliders led by jacob stokes the very largest slide she had ever seen her mother held her tight lest the temptation might prove too strong for human weakness and such perhaps it might have been but for a countertemptation held out by lord delancy who not only promised hera lesson in skating but had actually provided himself with a pair of such skates as are used by the country girls in holland lady cardonnel had led her companion into a retired walk xow then honor why are you here after that double loss which all lamented i heard of you with your aunt i heard of you as on the point of marriage to sir philip hervey and you believed that report xo and i can understand why refusing such a match as sir philip a residence with the lynmeres might become painful but why not go to your uncle eossborough why not come to me dear lady cardonnel why go out as a governess why come here ah that i fear was an error to go as a governess was i still believe right and wise the loss of that dear father that dear brother who were everything to me has left me destitute of means as well as withered in affection why should one absolutely penniless shrink from earning her bread by honest labour and nowhere could i be more useful or more content than with these kind people here however i should not have come had i been aware of the chance of meeting any old acquaintance even you dear lady cardonnel it seems strange to say but i had never heard of lorddelancy in connection with atherton nor of atherton in connection with lord delancy until i arrived at the gate of my new dwelling if spoken of at all it must ave been as the hall in contradistinction to the castle the name of delancy first met my ear as i was at the very door of my future residence then i endeavoured to prevail on mr langhton to take me back again i did not tell him all and since then i have tried to persuade mrs warner to let me return to town confessing frankly that i had received much kindness from you and that my heart was not yet strong enough to meet one who had known me before i was an orphan and they refused to part with you they would not hear of it and after all why should i go tiat harm can result from my staying nobody knows better than you that before major delancys attentions to me had produced the natural effect of such attentions from such a man i had become aware of my own position and of his ah dearest friend how can i ever thank you enough for the frankness which saved me from causing the misery of such a son and such a father causing and sharing i knew that the small portion which i inherited from my mother was no longer mine since it was urgently needed by my poor brother and my dear father i knew that major delancy was bound by every feeling of duty not to add to his family distress by marrying a portionless wife i said no when he asked me an absolute unconditional unexplained no what man forgets what man pardons such a refusal and if from my previous conduct he had derived any encouragement if he had guessed from look or tone or word that his proposal would be only too pleasant to me then a thousand times more will he resent that refusal since he must attribute my previous manner to heartless coquetry since i have been here i have gathered in a hundred ways from mr langhton and these artless people that the need of money at the hall is more urgent than ever and that a marriage is arranged between the young heiress and the heir look at her and look at me she is as good as she is pretty as charming as she is good besides no man ever pardons such a refusal he avill but treat me as his father does with cold civility i will go tonight if you think it right be assured that i will do all i can to promote the match for they are worthy of each other but i know that no man ever pardons a refusal without an assigned cause and i think that i shall promote it best by staying do what you will with me dear lady cardonnel i have told you all send me away at once if you see fit and paler than ever honor ceased she had poured forth this confession of feeling with an emotion most unusual to her and stood waiting the decision of her friend who had listened to her with the deepest sympathy when a sudden outburst from the lake of many voices in which cries of distress from katy and calls between fright and scolding from mrs bell were distinctly audible put a sudden and unexpected stop to their dialogue they had purposely sought a retired footpath on the opposite side of the mere from that where the pavilion and the tents were situated and which although following the general outline of the water was yet concealed from it partly by the irregularities of the ground partly by clumps of cedars and masses of arbutus and portugal laurel partly by brakes of hawthorn and holly the natural growth of the soil if they had not been engrossed by the interest taken by both in the subject of their discourse they might have discovered from the mingled hum of many voices and the gay shouts of the country lads that they were now nearly opposite that part of the lake which for thickness and smoothness had been selected by skaters sliders and spectators as the principal scene of the mornings diversion major delancy a splendid skater after enjoying for a short space the exhilaration of an exercise in which he excelled had with the utmost good humour left a party of the neighbouring gentlemen who had crossed the downs for the purpose and with whom he had been executing on the ice the different figures in which proficient delight in order to give a lesson in the mystery of cutting initials and spread eagles on that glassy surface to harry and charles glenham and some other youths of their age when he was summoned by his father to attend katy and mrs bell about the skating ground as has been said the ice was perfectly safe but farther down the mere the bank overhung by a large weeping willow jutted out abruptly and probably from a spring which fed the waters the ice was so much thinner that the spot had been staked out by tall sticks surmounted by little red flags in token of danger the space that was perfectly safe was so extensive that there did not appear the slightest cause to apprehend that anybody would stray out of bounds pets however are proverbially wilful marigold after playing every conceivable prank around her mistress on dry ground chasing the birds in the woodland jumping after squirrels on the treetops and trying to coax a dappled fawn into a game at romps had followed her footsteps on the ice and a little puzzled by the slippery smoothness and daunted at the numbers assembled had bounded forward until she reached the interdicted spot the very point of danger where the glassy surface yielding even to her light weight gave way more and more under her struggles the ice sinking as the water rose until at last the frightened favourite seemed to be totally immersed in the mere at this moment it was whilst katy was darting on to save her pet and mrs bell screaming to her to desist that ladycard onnel and honor found themselves on the edge of the lake a little in advance of the mother and daughter but still short of the scene of danger oh miss clive save my katy shrieked mrs bell and honor first making a sign to jacob stokes who was as usual close to his young mistress bounded on the ice and favoured by their mutual position was able to seize her young pupil </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> pupil round the waist thus checking her first impulse and gaining time to exert the influence which she and she only possessed over that adventurous damsel and to lead her gently towards her mother look dearest the danger is in the numbers who are hurrying to rescue your pretty darling see harry is on firm ice and he has got hold of her now yes he has hold of her collar and charles with his arms round his brothers waist is steadying harry a rush of people came between and the girls lost sight of the scene of danger but a tenable cry announced that the ice had given way under one at least of the eager boys deadly peril was in every glimpse they caught and in every sound they heard their senses reeled with the suspense and the fear which seemed prolonging moments into hours another rush gave them a view of major delancy on the bank throwing with all the power of his toland vigorous frame a long ladder across the space between the sound ice and the shore in an instant he had drawn one brother from the dangerous pool had lent a helpinghand to the other and then clinging to the long shoots of the willow and making himself a desperate plunges lie reappeared bearing the unlucky cause of this commotion the dripping trembling marigold under his arm the whole scene passed in a shorter time than has been given to the narration it was the ladder did it all dear dr glenham said he as the agitated father vainly sought to thank him for saving one if not both his boys the ladder saved them under providence not i and the person who in the midst of this confusion directed me to this same ladder and would have flung it himself if he had been strong enough was this good little boy jacob stokes not in general addicted to shyness stole away from the good doctors gifts and praises as if he had been caught in some misdeed muttering as he turned over his money for the eector had emptied his purse into his hand that it was miss who showed him the ladder and he had no business to be thanked for her vol i m doings nor to take the guineas and halfcrowns my young friends will be the better for a glass of brandy sir said major delancy to his father and so will dr glenham i am an old campaigner and know the virtues of cognac in the meantime i must take marigold to miss warner she would have been in the water too exclaimed mrs bell if it had not been for her good governess god bless her and thus after three years absence did arthur delancy meet honor clive her governess he had almost dropt the shivering creature that he held but honor had augured justly the pride of a refused man came to his assistance he bowed slightly but respectfully and recommended transporting the dripping greyhound to the fishing house where she could be dried before the fire honor to whom katy still flung was at last able to escape to mrs warner and mrs glenham each of whom had caught the sound of a vague alarm a rumour of unexplained peril and both were greatlysolaced by receiving a clear and truthful account of the adventure there was nothing now amiss except two wet jackets which had better be changed mrs glenham eager to see her boys and mrs warner desirous not to lose sight of her heedless granddaughter were encountered at the entrance of the tent by the good eector and jacob anxious to restore to the right owner the praises bestowed upon himself for discovering the ladder twas miss there quoth the boy she made a sign to me and i told the major jacob lost nothing with any party by his honesty and mrs warner now for m 2 the first time hearing from the doctor honors share in holding back katy said emphatically i believe my dear that there is no good deed inwhich you have not a part if honor had before doubted as to her line of conduct this confidence would have decided her nearly at the same moment a still stronger revulsion took place in another young heart harry glenham had been told by his father the suspicion which he himself entertained of lord delancys desire to gain the hand of the heiress for his heir he had been reminded that he was indebted to his kind patron not merely fora valuable living but for a key of his magnificent library the privilege perhaps dearest to him of any on earth and for the thousand daily attentions and kindnesses which sweeten life between country neighbours the fathers appeal had been felt by the highspirited boy but felt as we all feel words what had happened that morning was a living act as he thanked major delancy for the life which he owed to his bold heart and vigorous arm and as the young soldier pressed his hand and declared that the joy was his he inwardly vowed to go back to cambridge bury himself in his studies and never suffer a thought of his pretty playfellow to cross his fancy again is it needful to say that the mothers heart made the same renunciation </chapter>

<chapter>chapter x music books the arrival of lady cardonnel tended much to facilitate the intercourse between the hall and the farm the perfect breeding of the court lady and the simplicity of mrs warner had so much in common and in either case there was so great a fund of goodness and sincerity that mutual respect and esteem grew up between them lady cardonnel poor lady delancys favourite sister was a widow whose children the daughters married and the sons in the naval military and diplomatic service of their country were literally scattered all over the face of the earth so that her brotherinlaws house was more her home than any other abode and his interests as much her own as if they had been united by the ties of blood she had spent the three years of the occupation of france with her youngest daughter the wife of an officer in arthurs regiment and there she had become sincerely attached to her highminded nephew and hardly less so to honor clive and it was because she loved both so well that she joined stephen langhton in his endeavours to bring about the union with katy foreseeing nothing but misery on either side in the renewal of an affection which would bring ruin to his worldly prospects and break his fathers heart her advice to her young friend had been to remain at atherton the rather that major delancys manner to her was as cold as was consistent with gentlemanly courtesy if not indifference it was a resentment so chilling and so persevering as to answer the same purpose the good lawyer also was frequently at the hall and upon these occasions the two families were brought into still closer connexion sometimes they walked together sometimes they drove and then good mrs warner was seduced into joining the party still more frequently the younger ladies rode on horseback major delancyhad redeemed mrs bells promise by causing a beautiful mare to be trained tinder his own inspection for her daughters use his groom had been seen equipped with ridingskirt and sidesaddle cantering across the park at so wild a rate that jacob stokes not suspecting the disguise paid his young mistress the equivocal compliment of declaring that it could be nobody but miss katy the creature had become so great a favourite tliatthe faery queen had been ransacked to find a name to match her grace and symmetry and as if conscious of the affection lavished upon her britomarte seemed never so happy as when cantering with her fair rider over the downs every day and all day long of course the gentlemen attended at these momidg rides and very often the party at the farm were invited to an unceremonious dimmer in return the small family at the hall would drink tea with their humbler neighbours neo influence short of honors could have restrained mrs bells desire to extend to them a far larger portion of hospitality one day she beheld her turning over the leaves of an ancientlooking cookery book meditating eggs and bacon in blancmange and a floating island in whipt cream besides a dozen other rustic luxuries culled from a family collection of choice recipes and the slaughter of a hecatomb of poultry from katys pigeons up to the last turkey of the season lucky birds that talk between miss clive and mrs bell saved their lives it was now to date as katy did by flowers about the time when snowdrops hepaticas crocuses and the winteraconite were circling round the old </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> old sundial in the garden primroses covering the sunny banks violets perfuming the hedgerows and daffodils crowding round the orchard trees and the usual party were assembled in the pleasant parlour at the farm fragrant with the violets which she had stolen from the park when mr langhton addressed katy with a question which seemed innocent enough but which would have startled a more experienced young lady as the foreigner of a very unwelcome request pray my queen did you ever get the remainder of the goodmorrow song from your atherton poet the idle member of an idle fraternity as his brother charles very justly called him katy stood up womanly for her poor mend and arthur who had taken a fancy to the lad from the moment he had pulled him out of the water as indeed he had done by marigold a generous spirit does love those whom it has served made common cause in his defence lord delancy pleased with everything that tended to bring into closer familiarity the couple whom he so ardently wished to unite joined in the conversation caused by mr langhtons question and expressed a desire to hear the song xo replied katy the song was never finished and then she repeated the stanza sing it said her guardian but katy blushed and laughed and looked no although she did not speak it she looked too as if determined for once in her life to be obstinate sing it and miss clive will accompany you said her grandmother as honor took her seat at the instrument sing it and miss clive will help you said mrs bell sing it or we shant love you wont you said katy s loving saucy glance as plainly as ever eye spoke yet sing it my katy if you love me whispered honor katy unable to resist that adjuration began but before she got through the goodmorrow stopped suddenly honor accustomed to her fits of fright continued the accompaniment for a few bars and then said to mr langhton that burthen seems to have taken hold of mr henrys imagination for on inquiring of mrs glenham if she could furnish us with the remainder of the goodmorrow song she produced another which i have copied into this book suppose we try that katy i think mr langhton will like the air and not giving her time to become frightened she launched her dexterously into the song give thee goodmorrow busy bee no cloud is in the sky the ringdove skirts across the lea the matin lark soars high gay sunbeams kiss the dewy flower light breezes stir the tree and sweet is thine own woodbine bower goodmorrow busy bee give thee goodeven busy bee i the summer day is by now droning beetles haunt the lea and shrieking plovers cry the light hath paled on leaf and flower the nightwind chills the tree and thou wellladen leavst thy bower goodeven busy bee the hall party to whom katys singing was a surprise were enraptured with the young fresh voice and the perfect articulation is it not as if we were transported to isaac waltons times and were sitting in the meadows by the river lea listening to one of the milkmaids inquired the old lawyer of lord delancy like a commentary upon the observation honor began playing the symphony of haydns beautiful canzonet my mother bids me bind my hair which although not called so is as fully a pastoral as isaac waltons book scan you sing any duets miss warner i am sure you can arthur come here and sing with miss warner arthur had been sitting in the darkest comer of the room his elbow on a table and his head leaning on his hand as if absorbed by the music honor opened another book at the canzonets of jackson of exeter and atherton 75 placed love in thine eyes open before her again lord delancy summoned his son and this time he obeyed going through his task with the skill and taste of a perfect musician katy was again slightly nervous but honor to use mis bells phrase helped her supplying a momentary deficiency and concealing a little flaw much as a professed singing mistress might have done if ever singing mistress had had so true an interest in her pupil lady cardonnel also summoned to help in 0 inannie and other charming part songs leaned over honor and whispered swill not you sing i have never sung except as now a few notes to aid or an entire air by way of lesson since i lost him with whom we used to sing at valenciennes ay said lady cardonnel this is the old book and hanging over colonel delancys shoulder she turned over the leaves and read the titles time has not thinned stake oh take those lips away do not unbind two gentle hearts whilst another voice murmured poor lionel many weeks had not passed before katy added some of mozarts finest duets to her stock la ci dare ah persona ah guard sorely and ti veggo from winters ease of proserpine it is doubtful whether the delightful expression of her english songs admirable inarticulation and feeling or the imperfection of her freshcaught italian were most attractive but a deeper charm than either was to be found in the sympathy for her friend with which she avoided speaking on any subject connected with former performances of this music she had heard from lady cardonnel that captain clive the brother whom honor loved so well had been accustomed to sing with her she recognised the sort of family likeness which often distinguishes handwriting in some manuscript german songs other mss there were also but katy had learnt to read the sensibility under the selfcommand of her governesss character and avoided all trying subjects with the tact which is born of the heart vol i k </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xi sketch books let us take another turn under the limetrees said katy to her governess one sunday afternoon returning from church when they had reached the end of the fine avenue where the sunbeams played through the half opening leaves casting a chequered light on the broad gravel road for by this time cowslips and distilleries threw their bright colours on the grass do not let us go in just yet mamma will take grandmamma home and we will follow after one more turn mrs warner had been leaning on honors arm and katy was following side by side with her mother when she made this proposal with all my heart said mrs bell i cannot have a worse companion than yon katy for you have not spoken a word what have yon been thinking about nothing mamma responded the little beauty as the four ladies parted according to her arrangement nothing at au now this answer which is in the very spirit of young ladys the answer which every girl of sixteen returns by instinct to that question when conscious that she has been thinking of any object a little too much was entirely out of katys way that fair damsel being one who partly from the indulgence of those about her partly from natural frankness had never n 2 known the weight of a secret in her life accordingly those two simple words nothing mamma made a strong impression upon one at least of her hearers honor however knew that in these cases the best way to get at the truth is not always to ask for it so she waited and after they had walked a short distance arm in arm a sudden question offered some hint as to the subject of her pupils meditations do you think major delancy handsome said she the answer was such as to encourage a farther confidence certainly i believe that every one thinks him so i never did till todays resumed katy with her old frankness though to be sure i have always been too much afraid of him to stare him in the face but this afternoon as he sat in the comer of that great chancel pew with his head thrown back and his eyes cast down the light as it streamed through the tall window falling right upon his temple and the curls pushed away from his high forehead i thought that he looked very noble calm and kind as a soldier ought to look as a soldier ought to be observed honor and as i believe he is nothing can be higher than his character in the regiment he is beloved by officers and men dont you think continued katy that he is like one of the heads in your vasari those grand old heads of the sculptors and painters which are to a certain extent alike perhaps so we will look them over when we get home though why they should be like a soldier except intermitted honor that they </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> they were soldiers of a nobler army art that creates not war that destroys and i that say this am a soldiers daughter added she smiling but it is the truth or that which i believe to be so just then the object of their praise his father and lady cardonnel were seen coming up the avenue with dr and mrs glenham for whom they had waited katys shyness returned at the sight and but for honors better judgment she would certainly have run away home on meeting the party lord delancy took immediate possession of the young heiress and offering her his arm insisted on her accompanying them to the hall we are oldfashioned people said he and dine at luncheon time on sundays and dr and mrs glenham have had the goodness to return with us to coffee i am to show her some fine german and italian prints they are mostly on scripture subjects and would please mrs warner dont you think that if arthur should drive the ponychaise to the farm he might prevail on her and mrs bell to join us at all events i shall detain you asa hostage and overcoming her feeble show of opposition he conducted her to the mansion major delancy speedily returned from his expedition only half successful the good grand mamma was fatigued but mrs beu never more completely at ease than with the young soldier who struck such awe into her daughter entered the drawingroom in the highest spirits i tel you major that men are all alike exclaimed she finishing a dispute which had lasted the whole way i have had two husbands and am a woman of experience and i maintain that grave or gay rough or smooth talkative or silent they have all the same fault they will have their own way there was my first husband katys father who was so gentle and so quiet 1 did not think he could have spoken two words at a time well he had a way of his own i promise you and then there was my second spouse such a giddy whirligig that i did not believe he would ever stay long enough in a place to make up his mind to anything well he too had a way of his own and he would have it men are all alike young ladies all alike the very best of them poor mrs bell said lord delancy poor papa cried katy after coffee they repaired to the print room where a splendid collection of the finest and rarest engravings in the world were ranged upon double desks round the spacious apartment mr dillon has since shown what money and taste can do when they meet in an english merchant what an art it is that diffuses beauty as well as thought giving to these representatives of great pictures a home in overland and a chance of duration infinitely multiplied that colourless and silent poetry how it appeals to the heart the great painters with their fiery etchings and they who slow and patient masters of their own high art almost equalled on the copper the masterpiece they copied lord delancy chiefly devoting himself to mrs glenham left the other ladies to the care of his son for the dear doctor had fallen upon flaxmans homer and had forgotten that any woman had been born since the siege of troy lady cardonnel took charge of her younger visitors ministering with almost equal delight to the cultivated taste of one fair companion and the uncultivated intelligence of the other full of the eager questions which it is so pleasant to answer major delancy for his share undertook to amuse mrs bell who it is sad to say yawned over the fine marcantonio the huge rembrandt and the tiny waterloo and set all the efforts of her cavalier at nought until he bethought him of a certain english magician called hogarth powerful in cases of ennui and brought forward a complete set of the great humorist valuable for every sort of quality rarity condition and former possessors for many of these single impressions had a pedigree as well as for the satire and the invention which have made the painter immortal mrs bell was charmed she had the english feeling of character and that happened to her which has befallen many another gazer at those prints she knew the bakers boy whose tray is overset and had been well acquainted with the old maid going to church on a frosty morning mrs bell went on menily giving names to hogaiihs figures until the costume or the attitude of the principal character in strolling players dressing in a barn awakened another english feeling called decorum fie fie major exclaimed the irate dame look at the shameless hussy tying up her garter before everybody fie fie dear mrs bell its only to show the hole in her stocking observed the major in a deprecating tone poor wretches its just to set forth the mixture of finery and penury look at the tin crown and ill look at nothing declared mrs bell shutting the portfolio with a slam of virtuous indignation suppose katy should come roused by the slam of the portfolio which resided through the room and by the clamour of her mothers voice katy did arrive followed with more or less dispatch by the entire company the major had contrived to suppress all symptoms of a smile round his mouth but there was a glimmer of laughter in his eyes which showed that the outcry had not proceeded from any very serious cause he left mrs bell to tell her own story and instead of returning to the grievance which would probably have ended in the production of the delinquent figure she reminded lord delancy that he had promised katy a sight of the majors sketchbooks katy enforced the demand i had not forgotten my promise said lord delancy i made my son bring them to me only yesterday they are in the library now and sending a servant for four or five volumes of clasped books he laid them before lady caidonnel two or three volumes of very beautiful landscape drawings chiefly of lake and mountain scenery with here the ruin of a temple there of an aqueduct here an italian villa there a eoman bridge such scenes as may be found in the liber veritatis the magazine in which claude secured those treasures of grace and beauty which he afterwards transferred to this grand compositions two or three volumes of this character were readily displayed with no further deprecation than that of an amateur who knows perfectly the limits of his power they are merely reminiscences of scenery said he done for my own gratification as part indeed of a military and travelling diary and without any pretension to artistic merit under one or two the names of the places were written and katy exclaimed as in soliloquy thats the same handwriting with the spanish songs in honors musicbook major delancy was relating to mrs bell some anecdote connected with the scene and did not hear her observation having gone through all but one of the sketchbooks he was about to put aside that which remained unexamined when the clasp unclosed and katy broke into raptures at the sight of the fine old flemish town which it exhibited this is worth all the rest cried she look at those curious tall houses with the narrowpeaked gables which seem set sideways to the street the strange doorways the pretty windows the twisted chimneys the odd figures on the spouts the stone galleries here and there the carved balconies everywhere only look then the spirit and the truth the people on the causeway we can see them the sunshine and the shadow they are really to be felt look honor this is worth au the rest but honor had drawn back her chair lady cardonnel/ said arthur in a low voice shut that book it never ought to have been opened not on my account lady cardonnel said honor shew katy the old belgian towns the first sight of those drawings reminded me of the days when they were taken days when i was rich in a dear father and a dear brother but what is our whole life if not a memory of past happiness and should not the gifts and virtues of those loved and lost be cherished as a blessing not turned from as a curse show katy the towns she passed through an open french window and sate in the shadow of the colonnade looking over the park majordelancyknew miss clive then whispered katy yes she was with her father and brother when they were quartered at valenciennes where arthurs regiment was also stationed it was there that i made her acquaintance captain clive and my nephew were most intimate as you may guess from their </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> their haying made sketching excursions together and often worked upon the same drawing poor honor sighed katy yes she loved her brother dearly he was indeed a most gifted creature she has since lost both him and her father dear honor lady cardonnel then directed her companions attention to some highly graphic representations of flemish and german towns ghent antwerp bruges nuremberg in which the spirited and brilliant pencilling caught the young girls fancy more than the poetical feeling displayed by the owner of the book in lake and mountain scenery where the treatment of atmospheric effects the clouds the waterfalls the distant hills was often masterly at last in a sketch by major delancy of one of the moorish cities of spahis seville or granada a loose card wrapped in silver paper provoked katys curiosity it was a profile of a young english officer the pure outline of whose features was too familiar to her to be mistaken the initials l c were written underneath lionel clive exclaimed lady cardonne a moment after how like honor burst from the two for mrs bell had long forsaken the books she had demanded and was sitting in peaceful slumber on a distant sofa and from the moment that lioness drawings had been exhibited arthur had held aloof vol i o as they were replacing the card they saw another profile slightly touched on the reverse a female head with the hair braided as in the greek statues honor herself cried katy i wonder if she knows it meanwhile the peaceful hour and the peaceful scene aided in restoring the poor governess to tranquillity the rich perfume of plants from the conservatories blended with the thousand natural sweetness of spring in the woods nightingales answered each other from brake to thicket and mixed with the soothing fall of a fountain whose jets were silvered by the moonbeams light and shadow seemed softened in the park all was harmony till a stern voice spoke at the window apparently in answer to some kind remark of lady cardonnel do not tell me of tears margaret they are oftener shed for the liyiug than the dead this was a defiance to good or to evil and so it was felt by honora this time no tears fell o2 </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xii a y0t7ng ladys bookshelves three or four days after this scene mr langhton presented himself at an earlyhour in major delancys dressingroom he had anived by a night coach at the nearest town and had driven to the hall in au haste arthur said he dismissing the valet this affair must be brought at once to a conclusion i have not thought fit to speak on the subject to your father because i know as well as you the danger to his health of all transitions of hope and fear but i tell you plainly that dangers are looming in the distance the adverse solicitors throw out hints which of course we are not the last to hear sir yivian i knows is hanging about this neighbourhood hatching mischief according to his nature think if your father should catch sight of him before this marriage is finally arranged what might be the consequence i as you know do not hold myself justified as executor or as guardian to advance so immense a sum until at least the settlements are signed in short the formal proposal must be made at once i do not see any danger of refusal the mother and grandmother are strongly with you and the young lady certainly likes no man better aimless it be your father follow her in her afternoon walk and find or make an opportunity i shall back to my proper work of drawing deeds and a snap of the fingers continued he suiting the action to the word for sir vivian and his devices so departing without leaving time for reply the good lawyer drove briskly to the farm thither a few hours after we follow him now dearest mrs bell whose genial and hearty character had borne so well the broad sunshine of prosperity rejoicing in katys good fortune and trying to make all around her as happy as herself that dear and excellent mrs bell had her little foibles as all women ought to have it is only queen elizabeth who in the plenitude of her royal grandeur and her royal vanity desired to be painted without shadow our mrs bell was no queen elizabeth and the shade that throw into relief the broad lights of her honest countenance was the least spice the smallest spice in the world of mistrust of her neighbours she did not hate them she did not steak ill of them but she was a little addicted to suspecting them of hatingand speaking ill of her in short she had always a mrs grundy at the commencement of our story mrs glenham had filled that ungracious part but matters having righted in that quarter especially since the accident on the ice the reigning mrs grundy was no other than her old gossip and crony mrs thorpe wife of the miller whose bellteam had been eclipsed by the famous horses purchased by katys orders who now drew mrs bells waggon to the next market town as proudly as if it had been a dray of barclay and perkins or the lord mayors coach it is just possible that the bellteam in question whose paraphernalia had never been equalled in atherton might have inflicted certain pangs of jealousy on mrs thorpe and that the illwill was not wholly on one side whch speaking from a pretty long experience it may be assumed that illwill seldom is peace and harmony reigned in the pleasant morning room mrs warner with her bible before her and her knitting on her lap mr langhton whiting a letter which from his deep attention seemed important and katy at her own desire attempting under honors patient direction a simple accompaniment to one of herein songs all on a sudden a storm entered from the village in the person of mrs bell redhot with anger wellp quoth she what will that woman say next what woman dear mis bell what woman mamma iaquiied the young ladies almost simultaneously mrs thorpe was the reply she calls us all the bad names that ever were heard of bad names out of the bible wicked that she is all owing to those horses of yours katy said stephen looking up from his letter inow youve beaten her husbands team so thoroughly mrs bell you can afford to be generous and let her jingle the bells she calls us bad names out of the bible i repeated the angry lady sand says that i am as proud as jezebel and shall come to the same end and she says bad things of you sir she says that not content with calling katy a queen and im sure youve called her so these dozen years you are setting her up like one and have got an earls daughter for her governess and then she talks nonsense out of a playbook and tells of some old dcked wretch who set up his daughter in the same way with a decayed gentlewoman for her servingmaid to think of telling untruths of dear miss clive she might say what she liked of me but to speak falsehoods of her and call her a servingmaid and an earls daughter any one who spoke ill of miss clive must tell an untruth observed mrs warner perceiving that mr langhton looked perplexed and that honor with an expression between a blush and a smile seemed hesitating what to say honor said katy flinging her arms round her friends neck dear honor can this be true ingot wholly true was the reply senor yet altogether false i am not an earls daughter katy eut would you love me less if my mother had been such i never meant to deceive you dearest mrs warner when mr langhton enquired for a governess of my friend and schoolfellow mrs osborne she told him that i was in want of such a situation my poor mother dead long ago had been the youngest of many children my father a younger brother of good family was a colonel in the army when he too died i remained penniless add broke in stephen that she had given up her mothers portion that her father might purchase a company for her brother and pay certain unavoidable debts and losses honor pressed his hands lady lucy lynmere my mothers halfsister took me to live with her but there i could not stay because she refused a booby and a dolt again interrupted ivl langhton and then i came here said honor where i have found dear friends and a happy home indeed i did not mean to deceive you mrs warner indeed indeed mrs bell i never </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> never dreamt of concealment katy you will not love me less my katy for this accident of birth i do not love you less for being rich mrs bell was on the point of giving vent to a whole volume of flourishing apologies about the tentbed and the painted washhand stand but a kiss from honor drove away all her fine speeches and with a genuine exclamation we could not have loved you better if you had been a princess she flung herself upon her neck and wept aloud nor could we have respected you more had we known all the noble things that mr langhton has told us of you said mrs warner though how he came to know them began honor unless mrs osborne told me interposed the lawyer you cannot guess but indeed added he i have myself the pleasure of some acquaintance with your rejected swain an accomplished person who having a filly to enter for the oaks spelt her name of psyche without the p some add that by way of making the rejected letter amends for the omission he inserted it where it saw itself for the first time in the word filly which according to his reading stands so philly but for my part being of a charitable disposition i like sir benjamin backbite when talking of miss letitia pipers twins never believe more than half of these stories i wonder said mrs warner how mrs thorpe heard her news oh the country said stephen the country accounts for the spread of all news false or true as there are certain districts to which typhus seems indigenous so gossip springs up spontaneously in the country it is indeed its natural produce this country of yours this innocent country muttered the old lawyer quoting as he often did a poignant figment of horace walpole questions grow there and the christian commodity neighbours in london we dont know who lives next door you may bo dead and buried and nobody know or care a precious privilege now that we are talking of your grandmother honor tell me if you have a portrait of her and if it be here lady eossborough was one of those traditionary beauties whose loveliness lives in the ears of men like that of cleopatra or mary queen of scots or lady coventry ah exclaimed katy can it be that enchanting little print of a lady in a black hat and feathers which major defancy was looking at the other night the little engraving which lies between the leaves of one of the music books where my poor brother placed it just before his fatal illness said honor eyes i will show it to you said katy dont disturb it dear mr langhton added she in a low voice i think honor does not wish it touched ill hold it for mamma and grandmamma i have a miniature upstairs wych gives a better idea of her beauty said honor it is hardly possible to go beyond this said mrs warner this is sweetness itself perhaps sweetness was the best word for that loveliest face the rose almost emitted its fragrance charles fox has described in his lines to mrs crewe an english beauty of whom the irish countess was nearly the contemporary that surpassing charm of which the essence is character the lines are not poetry according to our present notion but they have the merit of making us see the object described instead of stopping to admire the description where the sweetest expression to features is joined by natures most delicate pencil designed where blushes unbidden and smiles without art speak the softness and feeling that dwell in the heart where in manners enchanting no blemish we trace but the soul keeps the promise we had from the face such was the impression produced by reynoldss pencil and bartolozzis graver in the portrait of the countess of rossborough still mr langhton wished to see the miniature and the whole party except mrs warner followed honor to the small room over the door which mrs bell had assigned to her as a study katy flung her arms round her friends waist as they lightly ascended the stairs and whispered did not major delancy know captain clive yes was the reply they were comrades and friends sand your father knew him yes and he knew you yes dear katy ilcre we shall find the miniature mr langhton yes here it is ah i how lovely burst from all when they saw those features with the full magic of colour sparkling with smiles and blushes as in life and here is her little prayerbook said honor rand a few letters to my poor mother let me look at them interposed mr langhton i take an interest in everything belonging to a beauty they are as sweet as her countenance said honor ah and here is some old pointlace the lace of which we were talking the other evening dear me ejaculated mrs bell giving vent as usual to the unsophisticated impression how ugly and what a colon i beg your pardon though added she upon reflection i dare say its all my fault and that the lace is really very handsome vol i p honor smiled as smile she needs must dearest mrs bell your truthfulness is worth all the finelady taste in the world i am afraid that except for the sake of those to whom it once belonged i care for the pointlace as little as you do there are my books added she addressing the old gentleman who was still busy with the letters of the lovely countess you can look over those at your leisure mrs bell had presented honor with an old fashioned very blacklooking little bookcase which she called a escritoire a combination of desk and shelves glass doors above and three shallow drawers with large brass handles below originally this piece of furniture had decorated the best parlour the shelves having been filled by a collection of stuffed birds of all nations considerably the worse for wear cockatoos were there and paroquet and hummingbirds no bigger than cockchases reliques bequeathed to some former generation by a longdeceased sailoruncle and ringouzel white blackbirds and other animosities of the same sort stuffed by a traditionary aunt martha who had cultivated that singular female accomplishment mrs beu had sighed over the dingy and motheaten remains as she put them into a comer of the lumber room whilst katy and jacob learned as they were in such lore had pored over them as cuvier over a new set of fossil bones guessing at name and species as a child at a riddle an old warped mummy of a home owl had completely posed them they took the unlucky bird for a cat and but for the beak which dropped off in the transit for a cat it would have passed to this hour katy had been the chief agent in installing the new tenants the books giving her assistance with the most willing p 2 activity in unpacking sorting dusting and arranging the several sets she now pointed them out to mr langhton who pocketing the countesss packet ran his fingers along the glass as he read the titles accompanying the action by a halfmuttered commentary delivered rather asa soliloquy than as a reply to honors apologetic yery few and rather miscellaneous than select chaucer spencer shakespeare milton aye the prose too thats right dryden pope cowley poems and essays right there too bacons essays evelyn pepys waltons lives lettres spirituelles pascal holy living and dying posters essays the girls a good girl don quixote have you read that my queen no sir and i wish so much to read it will you lend it to me dear honor honors answer was to take out the volumes write katys name in the first page and give her the work with a tender kiss mr langhton went on with his catalogue gentle shepherd howells letters gandentio di lucca curious old book that of bishop berkeleys i shes getting into my line burns aye curries edition wonderful creature i i saw him once eye like an hawk what are all these old ballads yes percy scott eitson ellis thomas wharton andre cheer dont know him i lambs specimens good ariosto alfieri moliere madame de seine defoes

be her brothers books miscellaneous and imperfect as it is this is the collection of a woman of a ripe mind worth all the beauty in the world ever since the episode of don quixote the good lawyer had been literally talking or rather muttering to himself katy having drawn honor away that they might look together over the plates in her </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> her beautiful book for it was that edition which contains the exquisite dorothea of stothard so our friend turned from the old escritoire and walked down stairs in that which is commonly called a brown study and instead of despatching the letter which he had been writing took himself off to london the same afternoon </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiii the coppice that aftemooii was indeed most lovely small fleecy clouds went sailing over the bright blue sky casting here and there a shadow over a landscape almost too bright in the full sunshine the leaves some as the elm and the beech just bursting from their brown sheaths some like the birch waving in tenderest verdure some as the oak sealed up in the dim buds formed a variety enchanting to look upon even where the boughs were bare they were alive with sap mounting into the highest branches transparent glowing full of purple light the orchard of the farm was one flush of blossom every fruit tree garlanded from the bottom to the top whilst over many a cottage and at the edge of many a wood some noble old pear or wild cheity tossed its white flowers in the sun up the downs too came rich glimpses of the golden furze blossom thickets of heavy almond odoiu left here and there to shelter the young lambs the park revelled in gorgeous beauty its noble mansion its masses of evergreens cypress cedar bay and pine its bright waters giving back the weepingwillow the drooping birch and the huge spanish chesnut the long lines of american borders near the house already putting forth theirs gay colours the broad avenue of limes the spiral poplars and farther on the grand old forest trees oak beech and elm with their undergrowth of hawthorn holly and fern that fern on which under the tufted may garlands does and fawns lay sleeping in the sun the earth too was full of fragrance and of beauty everywhere the grass had the deep verdure of england now powdered with daisies now golden with buttercups now enamelled with the purple bells of the wild hyacinth through this scene of sylvan loveliness katy with her faithful attendants jacob and marigold sallied forth to gather the first lilies for the great farm her guardian had reminded her that she had promised to fill his jar with that piue and graceful nosegay composed of some score or two of delicate stalks hung with their snowy bells and backedup dth the broad silky leaf of which the texture is as elegant as the hue honor should have helped to gather them but honor although she would never confess to being tired often looked pale after one of their long walks and this afternoon without walking she looked paler than ever so mrs warner prevailed upon her to stay at home their way lay across a comer of the park to a coppice which ascended in terraces to the high tableland which overhung the village the coppice consisted almost wholly of hazel with its fragrant tassels interspersed with mountainash now covered with its broad blossoms and oaks of some eighty years growth the ground was literally carpeted with flowers woodsorrel woodanemone woodvetch woodroof solomonseal columbine wild strawberry that strange and spectral flower the wild star of bethlehem cloudberries and lies in beds of half an acre scenting the air the path a steep and winding ascent led from terrace to terrace often undermined by foxs earths holes med up with dead leaves and living flowers and looked upon nothing but the broad treetops the solitude was unbroken numberless nightingales as conscious of the silence seemed answering each other in that exquisite variety of song so delicious when profaned by meaner notes the three companions had found in that pleasant place and on that lovely may evening a congenial occupation jacob plunged into one of the shallow pits spoken of above was driving a long pole as far as it would go into a hole in the side uncertain whether it did or not contain a litter of rabbits if that lazy jade flora thought jacob would but have dragged her fat body this distance her tongue would soon have told the truth of the matter no rabbit could cheat her into the hole would she have rushed scratching and questing we should have tracked her inter the ground as old sam powell tracks the moles to be sure the last time she got into a burrow she stuck fasts and we had to fetch a matter of six men to dig her out it cost a good crownpiece in beer at the delaney arms which angered madam bell and miss katy got frightened for fear she should be smothered so may be tis better shes at home and jacob a philosopher in his way pursued his researches unassisted marigolds diversion was of a different sort she had discovered and made prize of a hedgehog which coiling itself into a ball exercised a kind of passive resistances which bade fair to defeat the manoeuvres of its swift and powerful enemy marigold was puzzled xow she gave it a poke with her pretty black nose receiving so sharp a prick on that sensitive part that she tossed her slender head in the air in consternation ringing all the bells of her silver collar then she gave a quick pat with one foot then with the other drawing both feet back as if they had encountered a redhot coal then the aggrieved nose was cautiously inserted underneath the hedgehog with a view to find out some morevulnerable place and the hedgehog thus impelled rolled on a little then marigold jumped first to one side then to the other to put her adversary off his guard for marigold was a greyhound of high race and therefore of high courage and adventured much to the damage of her nose another poke at last she lay down with her head upon her paws watching her prey just as a cat watches a mousehole woe to the hedgehog if deceived by those halfclosed eyes he ventures to uncoil before marigold leaves her post katy on her part was making quick work with the beautiful lilies as they glimmered so gracefully between their broad green leaves sometimes in large close beds sometimes scattered bere and there amongst the moss and the dead leaves with a tuft of fern or of solomons seal ora stalk of whortleberry intermixed the lilies were in their earliest and loveliest stage the lower bells fully out the tops of the stems crowned with pale green buds each larger and paler than the last there knelt katy filling her great basket now listening to the nightingales now singing snatches of her own sweet songs give thee goodmorrow busy bee was her greeting to one of those industrious insects as he passed by heavily laden give thee good even would be the better salutation said she for i think we have both been long enough plundering the flowers and may take ourselves home accordingly she summoned her two attendants when her basket was quite and she herself almost overset by a thousand curvets and gambols played off by marigold in honour of major delancy who had climbed up one of the steep terraces as lightly as the fourfooted favourite herself and now stood by the side of the fair flowergatherer i have startled you miss warner and marigold and i have scattered the lilies but i will soon pick them up and you must let me carry them yes indeed you must i am used to carry flowers happy they who have only known such burdens yes said katy yon are thinking of the poor soldier and doubtless his knapsack aye interposed arthur knapsack and musket and kettle and kit all that he has and all that he has not in the roughest weather and in an enemys country those are among the sad realities of life i am afraid that i was thinking of burthens less tangible but fully as painful are you going home continued he interrupting himself shall we send jacob back through the fields that is the nearest way and will you allow me to take his place as your attendant and see sou home through the park katy felt unusually shy but she said yes simply because she did not know how to say no and for a little while they walked through the wood in silence arthur putting aside the branches and guiding her into the smoothest ways and at last when they had come into something like a path winding round the edge of the coppice offering her his arm i am walking too fast for you he said you will be tired katy had often felt nobody could help feeling arthur delancys peculiar sweetness of manner his constant consideration for others his care for their convenience his deference to their </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> their feelings in a word the total absence of selfishness it was highbreeding the very highest breeding but it was also somewhat more this evening she felt more than ever this peculiar charm and yet instead of putting her at ease it had exactly the contrary effect so after saying loy indeed i am not tired i am never tired i could walk all day she suddenly uttered that which so very few people under any temptation ever do utter that is the exact thought which arose in her mind and exclaimed oh how i wish that honor were here i her companion half started almost stopped he commanded himself however and replied vol i q i for my part rejoice in her absence i wished to see you alone you are young and inexperienced miss warner but you are also acute and observant and i am sure that you must have observed even if my father had not as he has just informed me endeavoured to prepare you for my proposal that i was only waiting for some such opportunity to entreat you to accept my hand and share my destiny it was now katys turn to start and tremble there are some things for which all the preparation in the world is of no avail and a proposal of marriage especially the first proposal is one of them her colour went and came and if arthur had not found her a seat on the stool of a felled beech she would probably so far have disgraced her country breeding as to have fainted he soothed her into composure and throwing himself on the ground at her side proceeded i trust this discomposure is not caused by aversion o surely you said no it is then but the modesty which blends so sweetly with your charming frankness and i may hope that our union which would crown the wishes of all my family and which is equally agreeable to your own may be delayed no longer than the settlements due to so great an heiress render necessary you come to us miss warner bringing wealth which will redeem the forfeited estates of our old and honourable house which will save the peace the health the very existence of my father and yet he feels we all feel i most of all that that wealth fades into nothing when compared with the loveliness the innocence the goodness of its owner my father already loves you as a daughter my whole life shall be devoted to the endeavour to render you happy will you not speak a word not one word q 2 poor katy hung her head in silence and even turned her blushing cheek aside will you not speak one single word well then your flowers shall be your interpreters give me one of the lilies in your basket and that answer shall content me gathering herself up almost firmly katy at last found courage to speak i love lord delancy dearly and i know no one better all your goodness major delancy oh far too good far too clever for me but i must ask one question honor were you never engaged to her steer on the word of a gentleman replied major delancy with an open firmness that it would have been impossible to disbelieve it is very strange said katy those spanish songs in your handwriting and your never speaking when you met those songs are of my writing sofar is true katy and here i might tell you what is also true that i was the bosom friend of her only brother but that would only be part of the truth and it is due to you and to myself to make one of those confessions most humbling tomans weakness three yea a ago i did love or i thought i loved honor clive i laid my very heart at her feet and was rejected since then we have never met except in your presence i do not ask because i am sure that she has behaved with the admirable propriety which characterizes her every word and action by keeping my offer secret she has never said one word replied katy much relieved and this then has been the cause of your hesitation the only cause is there no happier man iso said katy stoutly i have never seen any young men except charles and harry and young mr thorpe and next to mr langhton and dear lord delancy i like you but how can you think of me after honor dear dear honor it was a strange frankness and puzzling to answer he took her own tone and told the truth she would have nothing to say to me katy but you will you not give me one ofthoselihes and with her lilies in his buttonhole and her hand resting on his arm the betrothed couple quitted the coppice after a little gentle talk he ventured to inquire still very soothingly for there was a nervousness about her rare in that bright and vigorous spirit since not from any chance expression of miss clive what could have given you the suspicion which had like to have cheated me of two flowers oh such a different person from honors said katy a gipsy a gipsy a fortuneteller enquired arthur yes said she a gipsy fortuneteller it is quite a history yesterday morning i was riding on the downs with marigold and jacob stokes we had had a good canter for jacob wasonhonors pony and were on the point of turning back when we came to the steep ridge that lies on the top of the narrow valley called the soak you know the soak quite full of alders and willows and cotton grass where the stream oozes through with great patches of gorse at the sides looking like masses of gold in the sunshine so sweet too oh so sweet grandmamma says she remembers an old shepherd who built himself a hut amongst the gorse i dont wonder at it i should like to live there myself vestiges of the garden are there still a gooseberrybush or so and an old appletree and i suppose there must be some remains of the cabin for as we stood looking down on the soak we saw smoke sailing along the hill side and two or three children searching for plovers eggs on the downs and these were gipsy children asked arthur i suppose so resumed kate as we were looking at them a tall woman appeared close to me and caught hold of britomartes bridle isow britomart has no fancy for tall women in red cloaks who seize her by the bridle and she soon shook herself free but she is the gentlest creature in the world when once her fright is over so after a little prancing she became quiet and then the gipsy insisted upon telling my fortune i had never had my fortune told and had no objection only i had no money and the gipsy declared that it was essential that her hand should be crossed with a piece of silver luckily jacob who is the handiest boy in the world and always has a knife or a bit of string or a hooked stick in his pocket sin short whatever one happens to want luckily jacob had sixpence and that and the promise of sending him with halfacrown today contented her so then here katy came to a full stop what then dear katy pray go on said arthur well then she took my hand and said there was a cross in the line of life that in a very few days go on i entreat some one should say he loved me but that he should really love not me but my dearest friend did she say more iso she was gone as suddenly as she appeared and today when jacob rode to take her the halfcrown she and the children had disappeared that is strange indeed observed the major strangest perhaps of all and you i told the whole story to dear and she advised me sto do as i have done in short said poorkaty was i wrong never wrong replied arthur very warmly to follow in all things the dictates of one whose simplicity is the truest wisdom never wrong to tell all that is in your own pure heart that woman must have been an emissary of sir vivian here is my father we will not mention her to him lord delancys ecstasy in welcoming his future daughterinlaw was delightful to his son god grant that t may make her happy was his inward prayer </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiv the lomax station the intended marriage although known by everybody still passed as officially unannounced the ceremony was to be performed with the strictest privacy none but the two families being present and the young couple departing at once </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> once for a years absence on the continent a highly recommended maid accustomed to foreign travel had been engaged by mrs osborne and was now at atherton honors advice to mrs wilier had been that she only should accompany the fair bride she knew arthur well and felt how tenderly he would be drawn towards the sweet creature who would depend upon him for her slightest action her hourly amusement almost her daily speech she knew the charm of intelligent ignorance when combined with youth and beauty here that ignorance took its most graceful form it was clearer every day that theirs was no love match the lady allowing for her girlish modesty was too open the gentleman too reserved but daily intercourse would substitute for the frail passion love the firm but gradual foundations of habit esteem and affection no such bad exchange after all so katy was to go alone lady lucy finding that the spouse she had selected for her niece was devoted to the turf and the dice box had repented her hasty anger and had written to request her return a brother of her father also struck by her spirit or unwilling that so near a relative should be known to fill a dependent situation had entreated her to make his house her home but resisting both invitations honor had promised mrs warner to remain at the farm until katy should return to atherton privately as everything was to be conducted the preparations for so long an absence and the settlement of so large a property consumed nearly the whole time to the day fixed for the payment of the mortgage and at last that very day itself had come to be chosen for signing the deeds and performing the marriage ceremony our friend mr langhton deeply engaged in this most important business and other affairs connected with the executorship had been little seen at atherton sir yivian a bird of ill omen was known to be flitting about the neighbourhood although his very name was carefully kept from the noble owner of the hall just now furnished with a pleasant excitement in the presence of mr langhtons favourite mrs osborne to show her the beauties of the vicinity filled pleasantly the time of expectation always lingering and never felt to linger so painfully as when as in this case expectation was mingled with anxiety kobddy could tell why nobody perhaps would have confessed to the feeling but it weighed upon every mind and as the time of suspense shortened and it wanted now but three days to that fixed for the marriage the weight pressed more and more heavily so they tried the old remedy and drove about in hopes of leaving care behind one of katys greatest charms was her dark glossy hair curling in close rings like the tendrils of the vine all round her neck that swanlike neck on which her head was placed so finely before he had called her his queen mr langhton who loved pet names and had always petted katy used to call her miss wigsby and really it was difficult to imagine that such a quantity of bright curls all grew upon that little head the bright hair the bright eyes the bright complexion the bright teeth the dimples the smiles and the elastic figure becoming every day more firm and vigorous all denoted health as perfect as a woman could enjoy but perhaps of all these tokens of youthful strength the bright curls were the most striking mrs bell proud as she well might be of her beautiful daughter took especial delight in all that displayed their shining luxuriance accordingly she had herself purchased for katy one of those flapping broadleaved leghorn hats almost in the state in which they leave tuscany and brought it to katys room this very morning to be worn on an excursion to an ancient eoman encampment commanding the extensive and varied views chosen by the masters of the world for their walled towns and entrenched stations in barbarian lands the party from the hall was to form part of the expedition mrs bell was to accompany lady cardonnel and mrs osborne in the carriage whilst the gentlemen rode on horseback with the younger ladies little as the two girls who lived with each other more as elder sister with younger than as governess and pupil were disposed to differ this excursion caused something like a discussion between them katy had taken one of her fancies that honor should ride britomarte she wished to see how her two favourites looked together this at least was the reason she alleged perhaps her secret thought might be a desire to leave the favourite horse as a parting gift to the friend who staid behind to comfort her grand mamma of this she said nothing and honora asserting her own desire to ride the good old pony as long as opposition on a trifling point seemed wise at length consented katy with the new hat and its long lutestring ribbons floating on the aii looked more than commonly radiant when she joined the party at the gate of the courtyard disappointment met her there in the shape of another pet or rather of his absence jacob stokes a true country boy had not yet arrived at the age in which country boys delight in finery those days were yet to come at present his tendencies lay so inch in a contrary direction vol i r that katy whose first thought had been to procure a new suit for this devoted follower found the new suit want renewal so often that she had been fain to coax mr langhton into giving the atherton tailor a permanent and unlimited order for jacobs apparel even this magnificent provision sometimes failed jacobs tastes were semi aquatic so that his clothes were as often wet as diy jacob was a climber and spent in the air that is to say on the treetops after squirrels and birds nests much of the time not passed in the water so that his jacket and trousers were much oftener torn than whole on this unlucky day both misfortunes had befallen the young gentleman he had torn his every day jacket and trousers in the most unseemly manner the night before in an encounter with a jagged branch in his descent from a fir tree which tree he had mounted to secure a pair of ringdoves intended as a present for miss honor having preferred the total min of his raiment and some damage to his skin to the possible loss of the birds whilst on this very morning an awkward ducking fiom a boat on the mere had soaked his sunday garments through and through poor jacob was an orphan so that there were no kind female friends to sew up his rents or to dry his wetting indeed mrs bell who used to declare that even katys fortune could never stand jacobs waste was one day heard to admit in a fit of relenting that to be sure the child had never known the comfort of a mother to scold him so he put on such rags as did not offend against decency probably the prelegacy suit and being rather ashamed to present himself at the hall stables where being a great favourite with masters and men he was usually mounted on such occasions lie made his appearance on his own old donkey and happening to fall in with his unfriend mrs bell got sent off so peremptorily that when enquired after by his young mistress neither he nor marigold could be found mrs bell was indignant she ordered joseph to attend her daughter she harangued on jacobs iniquities in rags and on his donkey but that boy will ride anything all atherton knows that there is nothing with four legs that jacob wont ride before he was five years old continued she addressing herself now to an enlarged audience some showpeople who came to the village with a camel and a monkey put him on the camels hump and had well nigh carried him off to take the place of the monkey only dr glenham and joseph set off in pursuit the doctor not choosing a christian child should be carried off for a monkey he cried to go with them then and some day or other youll see that hell be riding an elephant everybody took jacobs part and major delancy promised that some fine morning she should see him so smart that she would not know him whilst this took place in one part of the group a different dialogue was going on in another why are you not riding britomarte have you quarrelled with her said lord delancy to katy jso was the reply but honor oh miss clive interrupted lord delancy she i suppose has quarrelled with the pony iso dear lord delancy no </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense4> no indeed i had much ado to make honor ride briton but i wanted to see them together and then she stopped suddenly ill tell you why another time by this time old joseph had arrived pointed on the steady steed that had fora dozen years drawn mrs bell in her onehorse chaise to market and dressed in the wellpreserved suit in which he had for at least as many years driven his good mistress on week days and attended church on the sabbath looking in short exactly like what he was a most respectable farm servant but matching lord delancys carriage postilions and grooms much worse than jacob whether on camel or donkey katy jumped upon her pony mrs bell was handed into the carriage and the cavalcade set forth the road up to the downs on the opposite side of the valley to the beautiful demesne of lord delancy which begining in park and gardens merged into a wild and wooded chase was little more thana cart track after leaving the village with its cornfields and meadows cultivation disappeared bit by bit first came a bit of woodland graphically called the scrubs divided from the road by a stunted hedge just now gay with the white blossoms of the wayfaring tree giving token of a water course from the hills whilst on the other side of the road gay slips of the beautiful sainfoin now in full flower and gayer patches of turnipseed in its yellow blossom ran up between masses of russet furze or the short parched grass on the steep ascent forming one of those contrasts seldom seen without the aid of man the scrubs edged off into a ragged fir plantation many trees looking dead or half dead the branches on one side being altogether sere and bare and then the trees ceased altogether in one wild group of scotch firs which flung their giant arms across the road crowning the hill with a boldness worthy of the pencil of salvator rosa tlicy were now fairly on the dovns the whole party paused to look at atherton which lay beneath them as a picture its deep winding road its bright waters its grey church its orchards its cottages its farm and the magnificent park and mansion which in spite of all assurance every one felt to be trembling in the balance lord delancy gazed on the view then on his son and on the two young women as they sate together near the carriage katy bright as the summer air honor pale and silent beside her a bitterness which he could not overcome passed across him as his eye fell upon that pallid face and noted how cautiously his son avoided meeting those gentle looks now for the view which i shall show you said katy the view which looks down upon three counties and sees parts of more than i can tell wc must cross this ocean of downs and then descend the willowy bottom and then climb up the hollow way and there we are it is not so far as katys description would make you think said lady cardonne parenthetically to mrs osborne the view seen over an abrupt precipice a sheer descent of craggy turf is on a clear day like this really splendid why then are we waiting asked lord delancy adding with the cold respect which is so painful to its object if miss clive will ride on the carriage may follow honor made way instantly and then exerted herself to manage the spirited creature she rode and keep pace with the cavalcade the level plain was passed at a canter and they descended at a somewhat slower rate a hill which dipped into a bottom where sallow bushes betrayed the presence of a stream that first trickled across a road the hollow way as katy called it which seemed hardly wide enough for the carriage and crept winding up the lofty hill that fronted them the steepness being somewhat mitigated by the road sloping diagonally round the shoulder of the hill to the top on the summit was a narrow tableland marked by an embankment said to be of the time of the romans terminated by the famous view they paused for a moment in the little valley the postilions rather unwilling to risk their townbuilt carriage on so rugged a road hoping perhaps that the ladies might prefer walking up the ascent no such motion was made mrs bell was too well pleased to find herself for the first time in a carriage and four to dream of quitting that post of grandeur and of the other two mrs osborne feared the fatigue for lady cardonnel and lady cardonnel for mrs osborne so the postilions let the horses wet their mouths at the brooklet that crossed the road and then slowly proceeded in the wake of the riders katy was wild with glee the nesh air of the hills always so exhilarating the exercise which she loved so well the beauty of the day above all the manner in which her two favourites honor and britomarte became each other delighted her very heart her new hat had fallen back hanging only by the strings her glossy curls were all dishevelled by the wind and she galloped here and there all her cares even the coming wedding forgotten laughing and shouting with her sweet young voice and looking the whilst so exquisitely pretty that nobody cared to stop her lord delancy who saw that she had attracted arthurs attention was quite provoked when her mother in care for her complexion and rather scandalized at her want of decorum called to her to put on her hat katy was at the moment when she received this command rather ahead of honora on the lower side of the winding road and chancing to obey it gave the large flapping leghorn hat with its long streamers such a toss right in the eyes of the highbred and skittish mare that she sprang off like a racer with the hollow way for a course and the precipice for a goal a general scream issued fiom the carriage she is a dead woman said lord delancy in a voice so deep and unearthly that it was heard through all the shriller exclamations of the terrified women follow her for gods sake stop her will you let her perish before your eyes cried lady cardonnel the old servant joseph to whom this was addressed answered as to stopping her my lady that is sooner said than done and as to following if any one attempts to follow her he signs her death warrant that mares thoroughbred and the sound of another horse following on the hard road would belike whip and spur the poor young lady has one chance the hill is the steepest in the country and if she can but keep her heart and her seat katy my katy i interrupted mrs bell with a mothers piteous cry the ponys off too and it was indeed obvious that the pony was following at full but unequal speed the track of the mare a few seconds made it also evident that this poor animal had not run away but that it was urged forward by its rider whose generous but uncalculating efforts to save her friend would probably have no other result than her own destruction joseph although his own weight and the age of his horse rendered any attempt to overtake them out of the question was so moved by the cries of his mistress and the danger of her child that he galloped forward together with the grooms to render assistance if assistance were possible or to bring relief from the terrible uncertainty that prevailed the carriage horses were also urged to their utmost speed and for the first time major delancy was missed and enquiied for at the moment after britomartes starting he had leaped the bank which divided the road from the down and was now seen pursuing a parallel course higher up the hill evidently intending to gain an angle from which he might dart on the terrified steed it was the only chance of saving honora but the party in the carriage saw with sinking hearts that it diminished every moment that the strength of the heavy roadster and the skill of his rider would tell as nothing compared with the spirit the fleetness and the goading fear of the blood animal on which she was mounted the mare gained ground at every stroke katy still following with hopeless perseverance and arthur a little in advance of the pony but still striving vainly to get up to honor the road now wound suddenly round the shoulder of the hill and one by one the riders disappeared from the party in the carriage whose fear became more intense as the uncertainty increased and the precipice neared jviis </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> jviis bell in spite of all dissuasion continued mechanically to scream my katy my child my child my katy lady cardonnel was in gasping sobbing choking hysterics and mrs osborne ilolcl in tears but the person who probably felt most was he who neither wept nor sighed nor screamed the stem and proud lord delancy whose last glance at that gentle creature had been a glance of hatred whose last word a word of scorn moments seemed ages in that agony of fear and yet all dreaded its termination they urged the drivers forward as if they had dared to hope and yet they all knew that humanly speaking hope there was none suddenly a loud discordant shout was heard coming round the side of the hill and fear for a moment seemed lost in certainty all felt that it proceeded from josephs horror at witnessing the fatal plunge this conclusion passed through every mind and katy seemed now the only care when suddenly as they were wheeling round the steep ascent joseph himself was seen advancing waving this hat and shouting with the voice of a stentor that all was well a few minutes more brought them to their intended destination the eoman camp where they found the whole of the actors in the scene as safe as joseph had asserted and reinforced by two never characters in the shape of marigold and jacob stokes on his beloved donkey when they anived old joseph had just lifted honora from her saddle and placed her on the grass where she sat very pale trembling and silent major delancy equally silent and equally pale was holding the pony jacob still seated on his donkey kept a tight grip of britomarte whilst katy stood leaning over lier dear governess alternately laughing and crying now kissing the pale cheeks of her friend now shaking hands with jacob stokes praising him defending vol i s britomarte and accusing herself all in a breath mrs bell seized on katy for the double purpose of hugging and scolding and the rest of the party showered question after question upon the truant boy and major delancy prom his short breathless answers and the more detailed account of katys squire it appeared that that faithful adherent finding himself excluded from the expedition and thinking as he expressed it that his young lady might want him had set off by a nearer bridle road to the place of destination where he lay perdu behind the bank when briton approached he and marigold started up so suddenly before her eyes that their appearance and his shout of alarm had the effect of turning that sensitive animal from her dangerous path and caused her sofar to slacken her speed that in clambering over the steep bank that bordered the road on the safer side miss olives own atherton 259 efforts had stopped her jacob no mean judge volunteered high praise of the young ladys courage and horsemanship miss katy could not have sate the mare better katy had been taken care of by her betrothed bridegroom too late to stop the first runaway he had probably saved the life of the second whose overurged pony had reached the very brink of the crag without power to check its speed and now stood quivering in every limb with the sense of escaped danger the whole party leaving the mother and daughter to their natural transports had now gathered round miss clive who sate as in a trance making no reply to lady cardonne s congratulations and neither returning nor seeming to notice the affectionate caresses of mrs osborne she remained seemingly unconscious of all that was s2 passing round her until lord delancy asked in a broken voice are you hurt honora the name and the accent seemed to thrill through her frame she shivered looked up with one of her sweet smiles said 0 1 am quite well and sank back in a fainting fit upon the turf it is hardly necessary to add that none of them looked at the famous prospect they had come to visit </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xv teilptatiox whilst these events were proceeding at the old eoman station the eectory was the scene of a somewhat unexpected visitation it had happened this morning that the good doctor had received a proof of the trades which printed at the university press and submitted to a learned friend in one of the colleges was enriched with annotations and queries which however profitable to the future correctness of the edition had for the moment the effect of driving the excellent editor well nigh crazy questions which seemed settled were thrown open doubts which had been smoothed down into certainties were resolved into their old unsatisfactory form and a universal note of interrogation seemed spread over the new readings which were to convince every scholar from cambridge to gottingen dear dr glenham felt as many a dabbler in print has felt before him that the pen of a critical friend is a sharp weapon when the packet arrived he was in the act of dressing and stopping the operation of the toilet to look over the proof ran down just as he was to his library to examine various editions and muster up authorities for the use of a disputed monosyllable which seemed to him a question of life and death now the doctor adhered rigidly to his old clerical costume of black stockings and knee breeches and having forgotten to leave off the gauze stockings which he wore in the winter without editing a play of euripides one may contrive sometimes to forget that it is summer in our climate and being in the act of donning his silken hose he still presented the somewhat anomalous appearance of one black leg and one white one when several hours afterwards sir yivian delancy was ushered into his library at no point of his editorial labours had that den of disorder assumed such an appearance of confusion as now books covered the tables books littered the chairs books strewed the floor the room looked as untidy as the master who besides the odd legs had one kneebuckle unfastened no studs in either wristbands which straggled forth from his grey and no cravat round his neck and this at foi oclock of a fine summer day host and visitor were taken aback this however could not last long dr glenham always a gentleman recovered at once from this learned abstraction and from the shame of being caught in it and sir yivian a man of the worldsmith a point to gain took care to see as little of the disorder as might be he even whilst the rector was clearing a seat for him contrived to intimate his admiration of the rare scholarship evinced by the books amidst which he stood and to express something like envy of the learned abstraction of which the result would bethe enlightenment of the world in general and of the universities in particular the doctor now completely aroused kept his own counsel as to the manner in which his labours had been called to account by one of the most eminent luminaries of those universities and waiving his guests compliments with something like a deprecatory smile requested to know in what ho could be of use to him you hardly seem to remember me dr glenham said the guest yet smell you were eector of atherton when i returned from india longer ago than i like to remember yes replied the doctor i was so but yoiu dsit was i think a short one and i was much engaged at cambridge not having chosen to resign my college tutorship imtil the examination of my pupils had taken place two of them were wranglers of the year we must however have met and it does not need a personal acquaintance to inspire me with a deep interest in the welfare of any of the family of delancy sir yivian bowed as accepting the compliment and the good doctor continued i owe to lord delancy the home where m days have passed easily happily aud not i trust without benefit to my flock he lias much contributed by his society and his cooperation to my personal enjoyment and my pastoral usefulness whilst to his son arthur i am bound by all those associations which link the old to the young i have patted his head as a child and have lived to see him fulfilling the promise of his boyhood as a brave and honourable man next to my own household i love the delancys and i confess sir vivian that the sight of you in this house is very pleasant to me since i cannot but hope that even now at the eleventh hour you have done me the honour to select me as the bearer of friendly overtures to persons who are after all your nearest kinsmen </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> kinsmen i know that there is in the very incidents of a lawsuit which is after all a sort of warfare an element which awhile it pushes on to conquest serves also to embitter the combatants but when once the battle is won it is in the nature of all men especially as we are apt to believe of all englishmen to forgive and forget a process much easier by the way to the victor than to the vanquished if you come to me as a peacemaker i shall most readily accept the office dr glenham spoke in perfect good faith lord delancy too proud a man to make unnecessary confidences had never alluded to the private wrongs which had envenomed the one great wound and the simple scholar ignorant of the desperate state of his noble friends affairs hoped and believed that the sore might yet be healed by a few concessions on either side and that sir yivian had fixed upon him as the mediator first let me ask my good sir whether you happen to know how matters stand betwixt us inquired his guest no other way replied the doctor than as all men who read the papers know of the great will cause one of those causes terrible to the contending parties in which wherever the abstract right may lie there is on either side such a show of reason and such a chance of success that lawyers may honestly urge on their clients from term to term from year to year from lustre to lustre until the expenses of the loser may even exceed the value of the original object of contention in such a case it behoves the rich man who succeeds to consider the state of the poor kinsman who loses and why there it is interrupted sir vivian there is the crying injustice they the losers and their friends talk of the great lawsuit as the cause of their ruin utterly forgetting the reckless extravagance of generation upon generation builders of mansions collectors of piohires furnishers of libraries wasters and spendthrifts in every shape and then nay hear me out good doctor then avhen the first and only man of their race who for two centuries has known how to make money and how to keep it steps into preserve the old property in the old name he is visited with as much reproach and reprobation as if in lending his own money he had committed a highways robbery or as if demanding it back were a murder i am to understand then sir vivian said the eector that the report which announced you as the real holder of the large mortgages on your kinsmans property is true and if you have indeed advanced the money with the view of retaining the old estates in the old name and making major delancy your heir in fact as he is in law i for one shall hear of such a puipose with unmingled pleasure and admiration sir yivian answered the part of this speech which suited him leaving the conclusion unnoticed yes i hold mortgages over the entire property and if not redeemed by twelve oclock at noon on the day after tomorrow notice of foreclosure having been duly given the estates and manors of atherton and delancy with all their royalties and dependencies become absolutely mine it was not however of this dr glenham that i came to speak they tell me that you are excellent as a parish priest the friend as well as the pastor of your flock and i come to make appeal to you in that character in behalf of the widow and the orphan not such as require the common succour that riches can give but those to whom riches has proved a peril far greater than poverty the simpleminded parents who are about to fling the richest heiress in england herself almost a child into the arms of a landless and penniless soldier atherton 271 be very sure sir yivian said the doctor that the whole circumstances of the estate are known to them all mrs warner declared to me herself that the son of her old landlord one whom she had known from his earliest childhood was in her eye preferable to the son of the richest duke in england katy will have enough for both a man ten years her senior pshaw my good sir a man of sixandtwenty and a girl of sixteen are contemporaries katy to be sure is full young but these great heirs are somewhat in the position of princes and are affianced and wedded at an earlier age than common mortals poor things it is a part of their destiny to lose the joyous privilege of girlhood the happy years that come between the restraints of the child and the cares of the matron but the yoimg couple are going abroad where without any set form of instruction so quick and docile a girl as katy will insensibly acquire all that is wanting to fit her j for the station she will have to fill no i man is more accomplished than major defancy or more calculated to train a clever i uneducated girl into a cultivated wife she is most fortunate in having fallen into such hands you think so said sir vivian with a j very peculiar expression then drawing his chair close to his host he continued ina low voice and with fifrequent pauses have you seen dr glenham a young j woman b name honora clive who now fills the post of governess to miss warner yes you know her then did you ever hear that three years ago that young lady was known as the daughter of colonel i clive and of his wife lady honora daughter of the famous beauty the countess of eossborough and connected with half the noble families in ireland xo you did not know this well this young lady whose father and brother were then alive was the object of an idolatrous passion on the part of arthur delancy you look mistrustfully ask lady cardonnel ask if you will major delancy or miss clive the were quartered together at valenciennes during the time the allied armies occupied france the brother and the lover were bosom friends do you mean to say that they were betrothed enquired dr glenham of that i know nothing what i do know is that three years ago he was madly in love the father and brother were living then now they are dead and she is here a poor governess the hired governess of his destined bride a strange tale exclaimed the eector in spite of himself much startled a true tale said the visitor on that vol i t i will pledge my life make the best you can of it and you mil find the poor girl deserted and the rich one married you know miss clive you say i have never seen her but i have heard and i can well believe that the elegant and cultivated woman still maintains her influence that the red and white of katys cheek is valueless in her suitors eyes compared with the grace the talent the composed sweetness of her rival think you yourself what chance of domestic felicity may be found in an alliance beginning with a preference for another hearken dr glenham these women are as it were flung upon your protection it becomes your character and youi office to acquaint mrs warner with what you have heard to caution her that the future happiness aye and the future conduct and reputation of a girl so yoimg so beautiful and so unguarded as her granddaughter may be wrecked in this union there is no man whose position renders him so fit to give this warning there is no one added he in a still lower voice so interested in the warning being heeded tell her to make her granddaughter at once a ward in chancery and then if three years hence the fine and spirited lad her old playmate who did not wait for her riches to lay his heart at her feet should be objected to for want of wealth i promise to settle upon him all this estate of atherton with its goodly farms and manors its waters and its woodlands its chases and its downs aye and the advowson to boot which would be a provision for his brother break off this marriage only break off this marriage and rely on me for more than i have promised and without waiting for an answer sir vivian departed and what said our good doctor as t 2 still with one white log and one black he sank back into his seat tempter cried he tempter it is one of the safeguards of the simple good folk of this world that the cunning wicked ones seldom give them credit for </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> for real goodness they think for the most part that everybody is marketable and that any resistance they may happen to meet with will yield to a higher bidding and so they lose the benefit of much previous caution by a too open avowal of their ulterior purpose had sir yivian contented himself with the impression which he had really made by stating that which was actually true of major delancy and miss clive and garnishing that truth with his own false inferences he would so far have carried his point as to have sent the doctor full of alarm to caution mrs warner the allusion to harry and the bribe of the bequest of atherton showed at once that either a revenge was his object for which no price could be too high or that as seemed most probable ho feared that the long coveted property should be snatched from his grasp at the last moment redeemed by eichard stranges hoards i will go to her thought the doctor to warn her against this mans machinations ill go to her at once resolved he magnanimously throwing aside the greek commentator which had stolen into his hand rand then ill come back and put up the proof after all i was a fool to vex myself about my good friends criticisms he is an able man a very able man but he has not given himself to this play for six months as i have done so i shall stick to my own readings and desire the printer to send the other sheets straight to me a wise resolution which to the honour of both these worthies caused no coolness on either side </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvi relenting when dr glenham reached the great farm he found its excellent mistress just recovering from the emotion which she had undergone in hearing of the danger of the two girls who might be said to divide her heart between them honors sweetness had fairly captivated mrs warner think if we had lost her exclaimed the old lady katy would have died too for first and last her giddiness was the cause of the danger she would insist on honors riding the mare then she flirted her great hat right in front of that skittish creatures eyes and then poor thing she set off as hard as the pony could lay legs to the ground to follow the runaway thus causing her to redouble her speed we never can be thankful enough to that little lad jacob stokes who is always in the way when he is wanted and was certainly under providence the saving of dear honor as major delaney by his great presence of mind and admirable horsemanship was the rescuer of katy what a blessing it is to think that that dear child will have such a protector through the trials of life i am exactly of your opinion mrs warner said the doctor but i have just had a visitor whose object was to inspire both of us with very different feelings and then being alone with the good lady mrs bell having insisted on the young ladies lying down and being engaged in narrating the escape and dilating upon jacobs merits to everybody who would listen to her he related the whole conversation may heaven forgive him said she he must be as old as i am and yet he thinks of nothing but money and revenge the money he must leave behind him as poor eichard strange has done but revenge that is a grievous load to carry with him to the grave and beyond the grave may god tuin his heart for he alone can i as to this matter dear dr glenham it is certain that arthur delancy did propose to honor three years ago and that she refused him he told katy so himself and that accounts for a sort of shyness which has always existed between them men seldom pardon a rejection of that sort it always oversets honor to think of the days when she lived with her father and her brother lionel you know that she gave her little portion to purchase captain olives commission and to pay his debts he seems to have been one of those charming persons not very prudent for whom wives and sisters and mothers often do sacrifice their all then her fathers death left her homeless and she lived with an aunt who was a matchmaker but honor did not like matchmaking so she came here a blessing wherever she goes i i should miss her almost as much as katy the next morning brought mr osborne and the marriage settlements but no mr langhton his partner however assured lord delancy that he might rely on seeing him with the money by ten oclock the succeeding forenoon wh en the deeds were to be signed and the money at once paid to sir yivian to whom and to whose solicitor formal notice to that effect had been given this was driving matters fearfully close but mr langhton had never yet failed mr osborne asserted ina business appointment and would certainly not begin his shortcomings with a client whom he so much respected a friend whom he so much loved the reason assigned for the delay was the receipt of a large sum of the strange effects which was to be paid late that evening he was also to bring a special license accordingly the gentlemen were closeted all the morning reading over the settlements at their absent friends request lord delancys composure surprised his son who indeed showed more anxiety on his account than he did the ladies had agreed to take an early dinner at the hall and spend the afternoon in fishing on the mere but only mrs bell and her daughter arrived lrs warner had been a little shaken by the aftershock of yesterdays alarm and honor stayed to take care of her between six and seven these two friends were seated together in an arbour where lilac and acacia the wandering clematis and the tasselled lime gave fragrance the whole summer through at this moment however a profusion of honeysuckles straggling and twisting amongst them all shed their unrivalled perfume upon the air beginning to emit their delicious odours just as the sun declines and the dew rises in front of the arbour a broad turf walk led to the house bordered on either side by a row of pinks alternately white and red backed up by clumps of white rocket double julyflowers and fraxinella and these again by mossroses white lilies and sweet peas behind them nicely trained espaliers formed a verdant wall concealing a kitchen garden which if it had existed in our days would have carried off half the prizes in the country that kitchen garden was the pride of old josephs heart he however was away in the hayfield it was his little grandson jacob who had just deposited upon the teatable at which honor was officiating a plate of strawberries real hautbois which he declared could not be matched at the hall they came from miss katys own garden and he had been sent from the lake on purpose to gather them for her grand mamma and miss honor misskaty jacob said shad had a great mind to come herself but the major had been answerable for his choosing the best and said he might be trusted he liked the major should he say the strawberries were good excellent jacob grandmammas kindest love said honor jacob turned to go and at the side of the path stood lord delancy there is no mischief dear mrs warner no accident said he giving jacob a kind parting tap i am not a herald of ill fortune but having been engaged all the morning with important papers and unable to get here i could not satisfy myself without ascertaining in person that you have not suffered from the agitation of hearing of our late sad adventure and that she whose danger caused us all so much alarm has recovered the physical ill effects of such peril we saw yesterday that perfect as was her selfcommand in the hour of struggle her strength gave way when the demand for it had passed oh my lord said honor do not speak so kindly or i shall give way again there are some voices whose sympathy goes straight to the heart your goodness would overset me quite well you and mrs warner must give me some tea replied lie cheerfully as eaehel and her followers appeared in the walk with the bright copper teakettle and the whole apparatus and then aith her leave we will have a little talk nowhere is the meal so dear to woman the english tea eaten in such perfection as at an oldfashioned farmhouse the thick fresh cream the newlychurned butter the homebaked bread the homemade cakes and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> and the female ministry in the sweet evening air perfumed with flowers and with the passage of heavy waggons loaded with hay all made it a feast of country luxuries yet even with the addition of katys strawberries the meal passed away almost untasted nearly at the same moment with her servingmaidens mrs warner retired to the house making a pretext of putting in water a white rose in which she had found the earliest golden beetle of the year katy loved to look at those glittering green wings and then to return the pretty insect unharmed to its tree you stay there my dear was her parting injunction so very calm and very pale honor stayed paler and less calm lord delancy stood before her i come to you a culprit miss clive nay hear me out dear honor i know that you disuse none of these confessions but it is a comfort to me to pour them forth when between five and six years ago my son then a very young man made acquaintance with your accomplished brother one of the most promising officers in the service i was delighted to promote in every way i could an intimacy which so thoroughly commanded my approbation they visited me together at delancy castle and at my house in town and i travelled with them in switzerland germany and italy never separating in short until the war which terminated at waterloo recalled the young men to their respective regiments whilst i myself returned to england almost as much attached to lionel clive as to my own arthur little did either divine that a few short months would cause me to repent that intimacy that the chance which threw my son into the same town with lionels father and sister already predisposed to be his mends from the friendship which united him with their son and brother should change all my feelings towards the family but already although i dared not own it even to myself i felt i knew that the fatal suit on which all our fortunes were staked was virtually lost and that in marrying a girl of high family and small portion arthur was insuring misery to himself and to her i found all my fears verified when i heard from lady cardonnel that for the vol i v first time in his life he loved a woman worthy of him in every sense of the word i told her what indeed she already guessed how matters stood with me and her next letter brought the unexpected tidings that arthur had sought your hand and had been rejected when my son returned to england this subject was never mentioned then came successive blows upon your house and mine the death of poor lionel followed so rapidly by that of colonel clive the loss of this lawsuit and the discovery of the real mortgagee in these miserable money anxieties every generous feeling seems to die and this passage of arthurs life was forgotten like a dream until most unexpectedly i found miss clive in the governess of the young girl the very sweet young girl let me do her no injustice whom circumstances had induced me to select as my future daughterinlaw the name the christian name the face and voice so like poor lionel and more than all the averted looks of arthur convinced me that i saw indeed the honor clive whom he had so loved here honor broke in stay now my lord hear me and believe me i conjure you when i say that strange as it seems i never heard the name of atherton in conjunction with yours nor ever till we were at the gates of this house heard lord delancy mentioned as the landlord of mrs warner then mr langhton can tell you ho w earnestly i entreated him to return he has told me so said lord delancy i know that you were ignorant of the connexion without confessing all that had passed continued she i felt that i could not convey to mr langhton the strong motives that prompted my desire to return i submitted therefore to enter the family v 2 and to incur the risk of a suspicion which i rejoice to find is now swept away from your lordships mind and indeed except the grief of seeing my dear brothers friends so cold to his poor sister and that is over now what harm has been done major delancy except in one generous expression of regret to see me in a dependant situation has never breathed a word which could imply a recollection of our former acquaintance and when tomorrow he carries away as his bride that sweetest child of all the earth fresh and pure as one of her own roses he will not i think find her the worse for the six months that we have spent together in sisterly love honor said lord delancy i come to say to you that i repent not only of my sins towards you those i see that you have forgiven but of my deep wrongs towards arthur and towards myself i have been carried away by many passions all of them evil by pride by hatred by an inordinate love of station and position and an inordinate worship of my own family partly too i have been led astray by sins that hide themselves in fairer names by a devotion to art as it lives in splendid mansions and in great collections by a love of science and of learning as seen in great libraries of fine scenery as shown in drest gardens as if beauty were not as general as the blue sky and the green earth as if the best books were not also the commonest as if home were not as dear in the cottage as in the palace the one thing honor that cannot be supplied is love it is my firm belief that arthurs affections are still yours and i come to you to lay his fate and mine at your feet let this mercenary marriage be broken off let us go forth poor and happy there will still bo something left the commanderin chief knew and prized your father knows and prizes arthur i shall not be too proud to share a soldiers home and if i have seemed proud and stem to you honor only consent to be my daughter and you shall find how well your father will pay his long debt of love honor leaned her head on her hands perhaps lie prayed for power to resist what was indeed a sore temptation if so her prayer was granted she looked up with gentle composure my dear lord she said i thank you from the bottom of my heart for a goodness and a confidence which will be a comfort to me as long as i live but this which you propose must not be these dear and excellent women who have behaved so nobly and so trustingly must not be abandoned strong indeed must have been your determination to sacrifice your own wishes and your own interests to the fancied wishes of your son when it caused you to forget that your honour and his are pledged to katy and to those who have influenced her in this engagement be assured that major delancy would not allow such a sacrifice be certain also that no happiness could follow an union so brought about he will find as we all find that the only true felicity is in the path of duty he and that sweetest girl will depart tomonow for the continent she looking to him for every act and word think how that will endear her to one so kind and generous as arthur as forme i shall only have too many homes mrs warner mrs osborne lady cardonne mr langhton my own relations are all earnest in invitations and your lordship will see before many years are passed that i shall be amongst your own guests at atherton with no other feeling on any side than that of the sincerest friendships </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvii a wedding morning the next morning there was not a cloud in the sky hardly a breeze to wave the uncut grass in the upland pastures i never was dawn so lovely as that which ushered in the weddingday of the heir of atherton and his blooming bride it had need be pregnant with good omens that busy morning when be the marriage private as it may so much of the outward and the frivolous is mingled strangely and jarringly with the deepest emotions with trembling hope and lurking fear ah those orangeblossoms those brussels veils i how often have they overhung tearful eyes and pallid cheeks taken at the very best say that affection have presided over the union let friends consent and fortune smile even then what a </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> a wrench it is from old habits old homes and old affections that bridegroom had need be very dear for whose sake the beloved resigns the companions of her whole maiden life the familiar household names the everyday sights and sounds the thousand cherished associations of which the full charm is never felt till they are lost with katy it was a more than ordinary plunge she left not only the dear home of which she had been the delight but the safe and happy station in which she had been reared that station too low for pride too affluent for want full of healthy occupation and exempt from all restraint except that of womanly propriety wliicli is perhaps amongst the most blessed upon earth she was to return to atherton hut she left for ever the great farm poor katy it seemed as if until that morning she had never fully realized her position she hung round her mothers neck she clung to her grand mothers knees she poured forth floods of tears on honors bosom it is quite certain that she hugged old eachel flora marigold britomarte and the pony it is not quite certain that she did not hug jacob stokes the first drop of consolation came from that young gentleman never mind me miss katy dont take leave of me im going too cried jacob dont you see how fine i am im to be your page or whatever you choose to make of me and britomarte and marigold are to follow with the majors horses that was settled last night in the boat the major asked me how you liked your new maid and whether i thought you had a fancy for any more of your old people bless you miss katy you may carry away half atherton if you like he and the old lord think of nothing but making you happy just look at my jacket katy turned him round and round admired the silver filligree buttons thought how kind it was to take with her the things she had been used to at home wiped away her tears and was comforted mr langhtons nonarrival the night before had rendered it necessary as has been said elsewhere to transact on that very wedding morning the formal official business of the redemption of the titledeeds he had written in the clearest manner to lord delancy that he should arrive at ten oclock that the settlements should then be signed the money paid and the young couple married the delancy arms was the spot fixed upon for redeeming the securities and none who knew mr langhton could allow themselves to doubt of his being there in time accordingly the party from the hall and dr glenham met at nine oclock at the farm the bridegroom bringing no other present to the flowerloving girl than a nosegay of such as she loved best they suited well her delicate dress and the beauty which enhanced by sensibility seemed more winning than ever mr osborne had brought with hint the unsigned settlements which lay on a table at one end of the old stone hall where the breakfast was set out and the company assembled they proceeded to discuss the viands partly as the lawyer observed to save time partly to beguile by any sort of occupation the hour that would probably elapse before the arrival of the guardian without whose presence all these preparations would be vain the breakfast was silent and sad a doubt for which they would have found it difficult to account had crept upon most of the party mr osborne who would have gone to the stake upon his partners good faith and who was besides better acquainted than the rest with the cause of his absence began to count up the possible impediments to his return his wife even more reliant upon stephen and quite ignorant of the eventualities which alarmed her husband began seriously to suspect that sir vivian of whom she had pretty much the notion that a child has of some bad genius in an eastern tale might have waylaid and murdered their admirable friend dr glenham remembering his recent visit thought he had found some more supple agent innkeeper or postilion to drive the good lawyer in a wrong direction or to overturn the chaise lady cardonnel accustomed to her s ill fortune thought that some new stroke of fate had interposed to prevent the clearance of his property the mother and grandmother now that the trying moment approached thought only of the grief of parting and rejoiced in every delay major delancy looked at the two girls as they sate in silence side by side and hand in hand and felt that the sacrifice must be made and would probably be made in vain his father was calm it seemed as if his anxiety was only for his son and that the rescue of his ancestral property from his treacherous kinsman had become a secondary object ten oclock struck it was heard first from a pretty french timepiece on the mantelpiece a present from lady cardonnel then from the old house clock in the kitchen then from the church tower then from the great turret clock at the hall these country clocks are never right said mr osborne i set my watch yesterday by the horse guards on consulting that watch it told the same tale so did the watches of the other gentlemen so did the old sundial which honor ran to examine it seemed as if the charm of mr langtons punctuality was broken he had fixed a certain hour that hour was passed and he had not arrived nobody blamed him they who loved the good lawyer which included everybody present began some loudly and some silently to entertain the most unreasonable fears for his safety can sir vivian have petitioned the chancellor to make katy a ward of the couit enquired dr glenham of mr osborne the chancellor is cognizant of the matter was the reply has any one heard of sir yivian today or yesterday asked major delancy i saw him with two other gentlemen at the delancy arms as i came up the village said the eector time crept on the minute hand advanced upon the clock the shadow traversed the old sundial and eleven was heard tinkling from the little french timepiece jangling loudly from the kitchen and pealing in deep tones softened by distance from the church tower and the hall the suspense now became intolerable again for the twentieth time mr osborne walked into the court to look or listen for the expected carriage dont you think enquired dr glenham when he returned again unsuccessful does not it seem to you better that the settlements should be signed mr langhton will then have only to glance at the signatures and carry the money at once to the mortgagee a momentary pause ensued agitated and agitating the lawyer made no reply surely it will be best said lady cardonnel arthur katy major delancy advanced to lead his fair bride to the table but all on a sudden katy escaped from his hands and flung herself at her grandmothers feet grandmamma dear grand mamma major delancy does not love me how should he poor ignorant child that i am he does not love me and he does love dear honor he does not say so he will not say so but i know it i feel it aye said she in a lower voice and vol i x honor loves him i always thought so i dont know why and perhaps i ought not to say such a thing eut i am sure of it only see how she is crying at this moment and look at him and look at dear lord delancy they love each other and it has been that thought which has kept me from the feeling which would otherwise have made me so unhappy now listen grandmamma one half of this money will pay ojqp these mortgages let dear honor have it as if she were really my sister and let her marry major delancy and let me stay with mamma and you i shall be as happy as the day is long when honor is happy too and let her live at the hall and come and see us every day what could we do without honor how could we be happy if we made her miserable let arthur and honor have this money dear grand mamma oh that i could my katy said mrs warner her venerable head shaking more than ever biit you are a minor my child and till you are of age we can do nothing ah said katy i am sure mr langhton can manage it and here he is thank heaven x 2 </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xviii signing the settlements oh mr langhton you are come just intime continued </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> continued katy whose impetuosity kad borne down all interruption flying to meet him and clinging to his arm quite in time replied he smiling and flinging down a great blue bag heavy with parchments these arc the titledeeds and you are free but listen to me mr langhton persisted katy honor must have half of this money more than half three parts now listen said she almost in a whisper major delancy does not want to marry me indeed he does not and i do not want to marry him or anybody i am too young let me live with mamma and grand mamma here in my dear old home and give her the money and make everybody happy now do stop a moment katy nobody shall many you against your will my queen said mr langhton bo content mrs warner all will go well only let me tell my good lord here that he is his own man again every estate freed galleries collections libraries all he has but one creditor and she will not be a hard one but dear langton said lord defancy you cannot imagine even if it were possible that we are capable of taking advantage of this sweet childs proposal i answer for my son as for myself aye and i answer for another honor would not let us if we were so f luse his son aiij honor pressed each u hand shave patience for an instant said our friend stephen of course osborne you guessed that i was detained in crossing fioni dublin we had headwinds all the way i promise you i had a race for it however i brought down halfa dozen undeniable witnesses had halfanhour to spare by the clock and by the sun and the thing is settled for ever by their own admission one word in this speech in spite of its peculiar interest had arrested general attention and strom dublin burst from several voices yes from dublin resumed the lawyer you have left the name blank in the settlement as i told you said he to his partner yes i see you have well now good folk sit down and i will satisfy your curiosity sit down everybody and you honor be pleased to listen do you remember a little old prayerbook wbieb had belonged to your grandmother lady eossborough the famous beauty and some letters of her writing which i craved permission to read well that little prayerbook had on the flyleaf a name and a date written in yellow faded ink the maiden name as you told me of your grandmother the second wife of your grandfather the earl of eossborough stow it so happened that i had been searching after this very name for five or six months searching i think all over england amongst churchyards and parish registers and registers of all sorts except just the peerage sow i recognised at a glance the handwriting of that inscription and the initials of the donor also i recognised the character of the packet of old letters i said nothing to you then because there were still a good many points to verify and make clear not only to my own satisfaction but to that of certain sages learned in the law amongst the rest to the lord high chancellor early this morning all was settled i took care to have sir vivians money ready before and when i tell you my dear lord and you mrs warner that the name was elizabeth brown of weston near southampton that the letters were in her character and that the words on the flyleaf were in the handwriting of eichard strange in short that our fair friend honora clive is the only surviving child of her only daughter and the actual heir to the moiety of the assets of the said eichard strange the missing legatee for whom i have been seeking why i think you will admit that my precaution of leaving the name blank in the settlements was by no means superfluous the conclusion not so logical as the usual deductions of our clearheaded friend was received in almost total silence the good lawyer tapped his snuffbox drew himself up and muttered half unconsciously the words of prosper so glad of this as they i cannot be but ray content at nothing can be more he finished by kissing honor s forehead who hid her blushing face upon his shoulder mrs warner more moved by joy than by the distress in which she had borne so true a part folded her hands in mute thankfulness mrs bell cried out triumphantly i knew it i was sure of it i was always certain that honor would turnout to belong to us somehow or other whilst katy laughing crying and singing in a breath skipped round the room iu an ecstacy and finally flung hersee into mr langhtons arms those most concerned however father and son seemed spellbound lady cardonne came to their relief tell us mr langhton how came it that the tough withered heart of this miser the modem midas who turned all he touched into gold was softened even by the matchless beauty of lady eoss borough where did he meet with her i have heard my own irish godfather boast of her as turning every head in dublin fifty years ago but he always claimed her as a countrywoman an lish browne jso englishmen replied stephen it is the one bit of poetry in a misers life inasmuch as true passion is always poetry looking over the securities left by eichaid strange i found just after the discovery of the prayerbook a note almost written over by accounts which explained some of the facts of the story and guided me to the locality lady eossborough then elizabeth brown lived with her father a halfpay lieutenant in the pretty hamlet of weston on the southampton theater catching the breath of the salt sea as your old sailor loves to do eichard strange then about fiveandthirty went there after a long illness for health and cheapness he had already laid the foundation of his fortune and offered settlements to his fair enslaver which might have tempted a richer maiden she refused his hand but that his heart remained with her this legacy sufficiently proves and now honor tell me did i do well in applying a part of yom money to pay off sii yivian i never in my life saw a man so unwilling to receive a bundle of bankbills was i wrong i say ohmr langton because if i were the estates can still be charged with the sum it is nota bad investment oh mr langhton said honor dear dear friend you are breaking my heart lord delancy it was only last night that you offered that you wished even if major delancy should still resent what passed three years ago you surely will not disdain to think of me as poor lionels sister as one to whom this money can bring no pleasure no comfort in the world unless you will condescend to use it my daughter my dear dear daughter said lord delancy folding her in his arms we cannot take the money without a far more precious gift but he has not said he loves me faintly whispered the heiress honoral my own honora ray first and only love exclaimed arthur and lord delancy with a fervent blessing placed her trembling hand within his sons nor even in that moment of ecstacy was katy forgotten swell said mr langhton halfanhour after when the name of honora clive had been inserted in the blanks left in the settlement and that important document duly signed and witnessed had been safely consigned to the keeping of the blue bag well it is some comfort to think that so excellent a specimen of engrossing will not be thrown away i hate to see good sheepskin wasted and there was some danger here i promise you for as honor refused to marry major delancy when she was poor and he hesitated at marrying her because she became rich and katy would have nothing to say to him at any rate a marriage settlement seemed as sheer a superfluity as the money which sii vivian brought down to pay the bellringers and treat the parish on taking possession of atherton hall well ring the bells next week to another guess tune and half a dozen years hence well have another bellringing and another weddingday yes my queen you may make sure of that for if nobody else will have you ill marry you myself in the meanwhile you shall stay here at atherton according to your desire with the dear mamma and the dear grand mamma coddling all the old women in the village nursing all the children riding briton stuffing flora and spoiling

dolly and hee beaux several years ago i spent some montis with a near and dear relation whom i shall call general vernon and his no less charming wife the lady anne at their fine place in the north of england they had a large and lovely family of boys from 18 years old to 8 some at eton some at a military school and one already in vol ii b the army and of girls from 15 downwards all at home the elder ones under the care of an accomplished governess and the youngest a fairy of threeandsixpence as her father used to say when the little lasss age came under discussion who not yet subjected to the discipline of the schoolroom and quite weary of the large dull deserted nursery and the good old family nurse mrs hicks i believe she had brought up three generations of the vernons a tun of a woman who sate in state in a great easy arm chair grumbling over her corns and her rheumatism used to escape as often as possible to the gayer parts of the mansion a privileged and most welcome intruder whose merry voice might be heard singing through hall and gallery the moment you entered the door and found indeed an almost infallible guide as to which part of the house the library for instance or the drawingroom happened to be that in which the greater part of the family was assembled wherever most people were assembled and most fun going forward wherever in short there was most noise there heightening redoubling and provoking the din was you may be sure miss dolly dolly whose real name by the way was dora though it is doubtful whether she had been so addressed since the christening the very maids even mrs hicks herself calling her miss dolly dolly was a nice little girl small of her age but well formed and active with abundance of flaxen ringlets blue eyes and a pink and white complexion not much unlike her own great wax doll and not very much larger the chief difference between them consisting in the absence of noise and motion on the dolls part wherein dolly had the advantage and in the far superior neatness of the waxen ladys apparel neither mrs hicks nor her aidedecamp patty the nursery maid being able to keep dolly tidy though they tried hard after their several fashions to achieve that most laudable object mrs hicks hoping lamenting and sighing in her great chair over torn frocks and tattered trowsers whilst patty chased her young mistress needle in hand running up tucks sewing on strings and tying sashes all of which might truly be called labour in vain for dolly was a romp at heart a romp in grain and it would be as easy to wash a blackamoor white as to preserve cleanliness and order in the person of a young lady who labours under that unlucky propensity dolly i am sorry to give so bad a character to my heroine was a most inveterate romp she romped with her brothers and sisters wherever she met with them with her father and mother whenever she could coax them into the sport with miss harris the governess with patty the nursery maid and finally notwithstanding corns and the rheumatism with mrs hicks herself who in spite of a considerable degree of gravity mental and bodily and a decided theoretical objection to such rudeness could not always find in her heart to resist dollys practical temptation especially when dolly climbed to the top of her great chair and stole the very spectacles from off her nose this was the signal for a game of play which used to last till poor fat mrs hicks tired as ever a poor fat mrs hicks was before was forced to give in and cry for quarter and then dolly who seldom attacked mrs hicks until she had exhausted the patience of her other biped play fellows used to resort to the quadrupeds of the house her mammas lapdog her papas poodle her sisters kitten miss harriss cat and a much enduring terrier of her own called tiny for amusement and consolation and they especially tiny and the kitten would enter into her glee and jump and frisk about and scratch and tear the clothes upon her back and make such a commotion as would have wearied anybody under the sun except dolly but dolly was untenable it was perfectly wonderful how much fatigue under the name of play that little person could endure from sunrise to sundown she was in perpetual motion miss harris who dreaded her coming into the schoolroom used to declare that it made her head ache only to look at her besides being a romp dolly the sins are apt to go together in damsels inter four years old was i am sorry to say a most desperate flirt she had early made the discovery that gentlemen who have no bonnets to discompose nor gowns to rumple make far better playfellows than ladies who have their millinery and petticoats to take care of and are besides less strong in the arm and therefore less capable of giving what dolly liked better than anything a good high toss gentlemen were therefore her decided favourites and every male visitor who came to the house was sure of being challenged to a game of romps with miss dolly but besides these chance beaux she had nearly from the time she could talk a regular flirtation on hand with some favourite of the house first on the list was mr simon bates the house steward a retainer of the family of somewhere about mrs hicks standing for whom in his youth he had been suspected of a lurking penchant and for vhom he still retained sufficient partiality to induce him to pay her long and frequent visits in the nursery when his flirtation with miss dolly commenced it did not last long poor mr simon bates besides being nearly as unwieldy as mrs hicks was subject to fits of the gout which utterly incapacitated him from the active gambols that his young lady required so he relinquished his post or she turned him off either version may serve as speedily as possible his successor was mr jackson the butler whose pantry abutting on the great stairs threw him frequently in dollys way and enabled him to give her two exercises of which she was exceedingly fond sliding down the banisters and trotting round the hall on horseback mr jackson performing the part of a steed and prancing and curvetting on hands and feet for her gratification what added to her pleasure in this sport was jacksons being furnished with a natural bridle in the shape of a pigtail he being of the oldfashioned race of butlers with a red face blazing amidst his frizzed and powdered hair silk stockings paste buckles and on state occasions an embroidered waistcoat with long flaps which some former head of the demons had worn at court a capital steed dolly in her lisping english was pleased to call him very niche hurtle but notwithstanding his alacrity in moving on allfours poor mr jacksons red nose was fated to be put out of joint even sooner than that of his predecessor mr bates the favourite by whom the galloping butler was superseded was a certain eugene prince or as his comrades called him prince eugene who accompanied harry yemen home from the military college one christmas holidays prince eugene was exactly the person to worry a young lady off her feet bold active lively and good humoured and blest with such h fund of animal spirits that he could even tire down dolly herself prince eugene was irresistible he tossed her over his head he shook her into penny pieces he called her his little wife he sang songs made faces and played </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> played punch for her amusement and reigned without a rival whether on four feet or on two eut alas the christmas hours do not last for ever prince eugene departed and poor dolly was left a disconsolate damsel to seek another playfellow as best she might she found or rather made one in the shape of the vicar of the parish a grave decorous respectable mr samian who at first sight seemed an unpromising subject for a romping bout but the gentleman had more fun in him than he seemed to have and being much at the house and amused by the manner in which dolly forced herself upon his attention and insisted on his tossing her up to the ceiling and shaking her into penny pieces and calling her his little tvife like her poor dear print he took very greatly to the office and on my arrival at general vernons i found him as regularly romping with dolly after dinner as saying grace before this state of things did not last long dolly was as i have said a flirt as well as a romp and an occasion soon presented itself for displaying her unlucky quality in full perfection it came as usual in the form of a rival the time of my visit happened to be on the eve of a general election and a few days after my arrival a fellow guest made his appearance in the shape of a young baronet who was a candidate for the representation of the next town where the demons had great interest a very agreeable person was sir eobert cheerful pliant and good humoured and so overowing with civility that he made his court to every creature in the house from lady ann the really lovely eldest daughter doti to finette and tiny of course dolly was not overlooked he outtossed and outshook mr harman made more faces and sang more songs than prince eugene played punch twice over galloped on all fours three times round the great drawingroom declared that she should be nobodys wife but his and finally promised to carry her away with him the next morning the night had been stormy and mr harman had as was frequently the casein bad weather slept at the great house and the morning being brilliantly fine we were all assembled to witness the departure of the two gentlemen the one on foot to the vicarage the other on horseback to the independent borough of g when to our great astonishment dolly marched into the hall equipped in her best pelisse and bonnet with a huge wax doll in one hand and a coach and four with their outriders the gift of mr harman in the other thtop shouted dolly perceiving that her new admirer who was already mounted was bowing himself off as fast as possible thtop i go too xo rejoined the faithless swain not now dear dolly theres no room you see im on horseback ill come back in a carriage and fetch you and your doll ill come back for you tomorrow dolly i go now screamed dolly i ride before i ride behind i or wife quoth dolly but all in vain for her treacherous admirer nodded and kissed his hand and galloped off he laughed and he rode away and poor dolly quite astounded at anybodys being as fickle as herself seemed likely to cry till catching a glimpse of mr harman who was now in his turn taking leave she resumed her doll and her coachandfour which she had put down in her consternation and then said very quietly well then mither harman i go with 00 no rejoined mr harman not today miss dolly ill come and fetch you another time and off he bowed himself and poor dolly quite astounded with this great moral lesson on the dangers of flirtation and the treachery of men walked back to the nursery quite misanthropic exclaiming with the dullest possible union of mirth of observation and falseness of grammar month with all alike she being perhaps the first young lady of three years and a half old who ever had occasion on her own account to verify the words of the old song sigh no more ladies ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot on sea and one on shore to one thing constant never month with all alike quoth poor dolly and off she marched to play with tin a highland story this jealousy for a precious creature shakspeare a more inquisitive race of dogs than the greyhound breathes not upon this earth wanting the sense of smell which usually leads astray those fourfooted people who like the best of the twofooted generation have certain small and genial frailties mingled amongst their many virtues lacking that temptation to step aside from the straight and beaten path they indulge their wandering propensities by poking their pretty noses into every crevice and cranny they can spy out and following every indication of life or motion which their quick sense of seeing and hearing can detect on every side many a dance has my lamented mayflower led me by her vagaries in this way and as greyhound nature will be greyhound nature under all varieties of coat or feature i suspect that the fair marion campbell found her pet luath rough wiry bony though he was and of the sturdier and stronger sex quite as unmanageable as i did my fair sleek delicate canine companion although in addition to all other points of difference the good greyhound mayflower happened to be a lady and we all know that the menfolk as a country friend of mine is pleased disparagingly to designate that important part of the creation are pleased to anon ii c gate to themselves a total deficiency in the great quality of curiosity i do not see that we womenfolk have any business to quarrel with this assertion if they who go clad in doublet and hose choose to make over to the wearers of bodice and petticoat the exclusive possession of the great faculty which may be called the very key to knowledge i can find no reason why we should disclaim a distinction so honourable except indeed the trifling consideration called truth may count for anything in the argument in which case i should feel myself bound to declare that according to my limited observation the quality in question is about as equally divided between the sexes as freely and bountifully scattered amongst all animals bethany pretensions to intelligence whether biped or quadruped as any what shall we call it any questionable virtue well can be that this same organ of inquisitiveness was as strongly developed in marion campbells rough and faithful attendant as in my delicate pet was made unpleasantly conscious to his fair mistress during a ramble which she accompanied only by luath and her damsel janet whose functions about the daughter of the old highland chief much resembled those of a modem ladysmaid was taking through her native glens one fine morning in august marion passed along in silence wrapt sooth to say as in the heyday of her bloom woman from the princess to the peasant is wont in maiden meditations which in the presence at least and as i suspect in a good many others was with all submission to the great poet anything but fancy free marion campbells meditations glanced over her mind mingling and crossing now c 2 bright and now gloomy like the tartan of her house to which indeed that checkered and manycoloured web a young ladys musings may not unaptly be likened first she thought of a new sacque and petticoat of pale lilac damask flowered with alternate bouquets of roses and carnations the most magnificent habiliment that had ever penetrated north of inverary and of a mechlin head and ruffles brought her in a present by her kinsman archibald cousin archie as she used to call him when they were children together now a captain in kingstons dragoons then she repeated to herself certain rhymes of the ingenious mr moore upon that thin diet did the lovers of poetry banquet in those days whose fables for the female sex published a year or two before had just found their way into the highlands then the form of a heather sprig suggested an apron that she was flowering to wear with the abovementioned damask suit then she thought of her poor friend helen cameron sister of the chief of dungallan whose proficiency in the mysteries of the needle had been acquired in a french convent and who had taken so much pains to accomplish her in the gentle science of tentstitch and crossstitch then the horrors of civil war the much that she had heard and the little that she had seen of the last years miseries for the ramble of which we are speaking occurred in </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> in the 46 came shudderingly over her mind as a cloud passes across the sun poor poor helen thought marion sighing archibald used to be jealous of dungallan he had little cause heaven knows i never thought of him except as the brother of my mend whatever might be his wishes with regard to me and now if indeed he be still alive he is chased like the hill fox or the hare and has nowhere to lay his head poor dungallant poor poor helen oh the sickening horror of such a war as this has been kinsman with kinsman friend with mend and now this fearful search after a vanquished enemy this hunting down an old acquaintance or it may be an honourable rival like a beast of the field oh to a brave spirit it must be misery sighed marion to herself imputing as a tender woman so often does impute her own feelings to the man whom she loves archibald must feel it so in spite of his devotion to general campbell who has been as a father to him and his loyalty to king george and now these fearful sentences that poor young girl who died of a broken heart at the execution of her lover they wring ones very vide whetstones pathetic ballad of jamie dowson a story so touching that even the false taste of the versifier has failed to spoil it soul but archibald has leave of absence now for the cure of that old wound at culloden and will remain with us during the whole autumn and no fugitive would be mad enough to come into the campbells country then in the winter my father talks of taking me to edinburgh and the lilac damask with alternate bouquets of roses and carnations flitted before the eyes of the fair wearer neo one knows what may happen in the winter thought she and visions of snowwhite satin nightgowns and white and silver brocades the bridal paraphernalia of the time gleamed for an instant in her minds eye calling forth a blush and a smile a look and a feeling of innocent hope which banished for the moment the recollection that such things as war and misery had ever existed in this world of sunshine and shadow these were the musings which the pranks and vagaries of lnatli had interrupted first he was aware of the motion of a moorfowl among the heather and he darted np the hill side with the speed of an arrow giving to his fair lady and still more to her serving maiden who exerted her lungs most manfully for his recovery screaming at the top of a naturally high voice until the rocks echoed back the sound as if it had been the shriek of a mountain eagle giving to his fair pursuers the exceedingly tormenting and provoking spectacle of moving away the faster the more he was called back then a deer shewed himself in the valley and off he darted through the glen with a rush that threatened to run down the whole herd while janets shrill pipe resounded through the uttermost depths of the glen as it had before climbed the topmost ridge of the crags then he contented himself with slighter deviations from the straight path skipped from right to left and from left to right poking his nose into that nook and this cranny until at last just as the bridal apparition had crossed marions fancy he disappeared behind a small clump of brushwood two or three young birch trees and a plant or two of yellow broom and scotch brier that grew on the ledge of a cliff down which in winter a mountain torrent made its way and vanished bodily or seemed to vanish into the face of the rock the extraordinary disappearance of her favourite followed as it was first by a low sound from luath something between a bark and a growl then by one or two muttered words the speaker continuing invisible and a slight noise of struggling effectually aroused his fair mistress who naturally highspirited freeborn and vigorous in mind and body as becomes a mountain maid plunged without hesitation into the stony bed of the torrent now completely dried up by the summer sun and scrambling with considerable difficulty for the loose stones gave way even under her light tread and she was forced to grasp every instant at the tufts of grass and heather that grew in the fissures of the cliff and hung over its sides to keep herself from falling succeeded after some minutes hard climbing in gaining the position which her pet had reached at half a dozen bounds and found herself perched upon a narrow ledge of rock overhanging the watercourse at about twenty feet from the bottom of the precipice hardly wide enough to afford room to the little tuft of brushwood above which the cliff rose in a smooth sheer ascent until it seemed mingling with the clouds behind this small clump of birch and broom and briar and now quite concealed by the summer foliage was a small fissure penetrating the natural mound through which it was clear that luath had disappeared and into which she also passed regardless alike of the dangers that she might encounter there and of the warnings of janet who climbing and remonstrating with equal good will followed her lady as rapidly as a hearty tumble which had unluckily befallen her at the commencement of her ascent would permit a similar misadventure had very nearly occurred to her fair mistress not aware at the moment of her entrance of the rapid shelving of the naitow passage into the cave in which it terminated she recovered herself however and found by the light which penetrated through the fissure the only light which the place afforded that she was in a natural cavern of considerable extent and immediately confronted by a young man 7lio stood directly opposite to her with an air and attitude of calm determination one hand vigorously planted upon luaths neck and the other grasping a pistol which he had drawn from his belt both were instantly relaxed as he perceived the sex of the intruder a woman exclaimed he replacing the pistol in his girdle whilst luath in a transport of pleasure sprang upon marions shoulder and nestled his rough head against her cheek a lady then i have nothing to fear and with a courtesy which seemed habitual he dragged a block of smooth stone the only thing resembling a seat which the cave afforded to a level spot near his fair visitor and entreated her to take possession of it in an accent whose gentle cheerfulness contrasted singularly with his rude and squalid aspect marion complying with his request gazed upon him as he stood before her with a mixture of wonder and compassion he was a tall young man of a fair complexion or rather a complexion which before a long exposure to sun and wind and weather had been fair and a countenance which in spite of a tremendous length of beard had something at once singular and agreeable he wore an old dark tartan coat a plaid and a philibeg with a pistol and a dirk at his side his garments were torn and dirty his feet all but bare and his whole appearance indicated the extremity of human privation one of those unhappy sufferers thought marion as her bright eyes filled with tears so might my father and my poor cousin archibald even in her silent thoughts she did not call him by a tenderer name so might they have wandered in their enemys country and have hidden in caves and rocks had the day of culloden ended differently it is only my maid sir one for whose discretion i can answer said marion aloud as the entrance of janet and her exclamation of alarm and astonishment at sight of the stranger produced a less emphatic expression of surprise on his part i will answer for her as for myself said marion warmly heaven forbid that i should doubt of either responded the stranger wherever during my wanderings i have meta woman there i have been sure to find a friend pity and fidelity are synonymous with her name how can we serve you said marion glancing towards the interior of the cave where some heather arranged with the blossoms upwards the hardy couch of the highlander and the remains of a wood fire gave token of a residence of some duration you seem to want almost everything madam intempted he gaily for my wardrobe you see its condition witness my two feet with half a brogue between them never was barefooted friar in fitter order for a pilgrimage and as to my larder that is reduced to a still lower ebb as these few crumbs may bear testimony i doubt if the leanest </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> leanest begging brother of st francis was ever so sparely furnished i have been thinking indeed of making an onslaught upon your venison i must have attempted it tonight from sheer starvation though the report of firewould bring upon you twenty armed men rejoined marion would produce instant discovery perhaps instant death heaven be praised you refrained and that luaths curiosity led us here to supply your wants if it had been my father or if captain archibald had happened to gang along wi miss marion the now instead of me interposed janet wliilk wasna unlikely ye ken hush janet resumed her mistress blushing we have no time to waste in talk they may miss us at home and eh miss marion but ye

procured from my fathers wardrobe but i ought to tell you inhospitable as it seems that your continuance here is attendedvvith vol ii p danger the most imminent i feel that i am speaking to one of the unfortunate followers of the pre of charles edward continued she cheering herself as her listener drew himself up proudly sand it is right to inform him that he is in the very midst of argyles country surrounded by enemies on all sides parties of soldiers in every direction and an officer in the service of the king nay this is no time to quarrel for a word with one who is risking much to preserve you an officer in king georges service actually in the castle what madness brought you hither you must not cannot remain here the same accident that discovered your retreat to us may make it known to others and then the horrors of the executions at kennington an account of which transmitted to her cousin by a friend from london she had that morning overheard him reading to her father struck at once upon her mind she thought of the young man before her evidently wellbon and delicately nurtured who for a wrong cause it might be but still for one which he thought right was enduring so cheerfully the extremity of human privation she thought of him today talking with her full of life and spirit tomorrow undergoing the fearful sentence at which her flesh had crept as she heard it and unable to bear the image which her fancy had conjured up she burst suddenly into a passion of tears much affected by her sensibility the object of her generous interest laid aside his levity and his haughtiness and explained to her simply and gravely that having been closely and unrelentingly pursued for many weeks he had taken a sudden resolution to baffle if possible the sagacity of his enemies by leaving the friendly country in which he had hitherto d 2 marion campbell taken refuges and planting himself in the very stronghold of his foes the actual spot in which he was concealed had been suggested he said by the local knowledge of a companion who had left him on the double errand of obtaining important intelligence and recruiting their stock of provisions but whose return unless he himself prevented his arrival by meeting him at a rendezvous some twenty miles distant he expected to take place two days after this companion was he added no stranger to miss marion campbell whom he believed himself to have the honour of addressing and to whom the house of dungallan was certainly not unknown eh pair dungallan exclaimed janet whose sympathy extended to all her mistresss lovers we ken him weel guide man he died me the vera brooch that ye see i my laddie in return for an auld glue that lie steal of my teddys forbye other tokens pair dungallan sae it was he that sand the cove he

to the pasty hell be just famished to sae nae thing of another tass of the whisky let him not come i beseech you said marion earnestly his danger would be tenfold greater than yours he is known he is one of the chiefs of the cameronss one of the principal planners of this unhappy insurrection and said also to be a personal favourite of its unfortunate leader i have known dundalk all my life long his sister was my early companion and instructress let me not have the misery of fearing that an old friend of my fathers house should be dragged from his lands to a dreadful death if he were taken nothing could save him my interest in him would be misconstrued it would be thought heaven knows how falsely but it would be thought proceeded marion in a low tone and blushing deeply i know that it would be suspected only this very morning when i spoke of poor helen the feeling burst forth his presence whilst my hotheaded kinsman is at the castle would indeed be dangerous to us all as fire to tow corroborated janet giiid sirs i had clean forgot the captain hers ganging gate upon that score he garret the soldier lads tak auld alison whos as deaf as the states in the linn to inverary to be examined because the auld wife had a wee bit mutch of cameron tartan that the goodman had picked up at falkirk to cover her pair withered craig no i no dungallan manna come inter the captain wad jalouse that he was hereabout by instinct ye ken just as luath wad jalouse a brock or a tod by the mere effect of natural antipathy at this moment the stranger observing that luath who had hitherto stood quietly and apparently half asleep by the side of his mistress pricked up his ears and held his head slightly on one side in the attitude of listening laid his right hand firmly on his neck and in another instant a quick step was heard in the glen below succeeded by a loud lively whistle and a bold manly voice calling luath where are you luath my man at short intervals it was with considerable difficulty that the caresses of his lady and the strong grasp of her companion could restrain luath from obeying the call the footsteps were heard dashing through the loose dry gravelly bed of the wintry torrent pausing a moment as if the passer by were observing the marks made by the girls in their recent ascent or as if his attention were attracted by the suppressed growls of luath or his repeated plunges as he struggled with all his strength to escape from his holders and in that moment a moment that seemed an age both marion and janet fancied that he might have heard the quick beating of their throbbing hearts at length the sound of the footsteps died away and the voice and the whistle grew fainter and fainter and were gradually lost in the distance for the present at least the danger was past after a long pause janet ventured a whisper yens captain archibald calling luath pair fellow be quiet luath cant ye just to find whereabout miss marion maybe eh sirs there d be wild work i trow gin he and dungallan should forgather their new acquaintance appeared to feel the full force of this observation well said he i must if possible be off tonight heaven forbid that i should lead my faithful friend or you my kind </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> kind protectress into unnecessary danger supply me if without peril to yourselves you can do so with so much of the commonest food as may give me strength for the journey and a pair of shoes to guard my feet from the rocks and briars and the tass of whisky which mistress janet spoke of to drink your health and happiness and iwill set forth this very night ye ken the road inquired janet i have passed it once and have learnt in my wanderings almost with the skill of a wild indian to fix in my memory the great landmarks of nature the outlines of the mountains the course of the streams and the positions of the stars in the heavens nay even to follow upon the trail of a companion by the aid of almost imperceptible signs a transverse cut upon the smooth bark of the mountain ash a birch twig broken a sprig of heather dropped upon the path tokens which even now that i have indicated them to you none but an eye quickened by keen necessity and present danger could clearly apprehend oh this necessity is the schoolmistress of all others to sharpen observation and teach a man the use of his wits we may dwell in a palace all our lives and not know for what purpose our senses were given us but turn us barefoot and hungry amongst these scottish wildernesses and we soon find that the chief aim and object of our faculties is to enable us to make a shift in which grand art of existence ill challenge any canny scot lowlander or highlander from john o groats house to the tweed it will be moonlight tonights added he more seriously sand i have little doubt of finding my way to the place where i have appointed to join my mend so now my fair benefactress i will detain you no longer and he took her hand and bent his lips to it with an habitual grace and dignity the effect of which was not at all diminished by his rude and squalid exterior so independent of mere extrinsic circumstances are those qualities of mind and manner that union of suavity and nobleness which constitute a gentleman marion lingered the night is of all seasons the most dangerous to a traveller in these troubled times even the fact of being out in the dark exposes the wanderer to suspicion could no disguise be thought of that should enable you to elude suspicion by day a female garb for instance the gentleman shall be welcome to my best kirtle and bodice and a hood and screen to the wale of it quoth janet eh and hell mak a braw strapping lassie a woman replied the fugitive quickly there you must excuse me anything but that braggart that i was i forgot my failure in that line ill play the woman no more no more and marion gazed fixedly on his face whilst a fresh suspicion crossed her mind and the colour mounted even to her temples no more but he manna leave the cave by daylight in a plaid and phillibeg of the cameron set gin he does the captain or the loud donald ill hoist him hint a dragoon and carry him wa to inverary like pair doited alison theres wealth o auld tartans about the town belonging to ae laddie or another and i can lift him a suit as cannily as ever my forbears lifted a drove o black cattle said janet laiigiiing sand then when he has trimmed that beard o his while wad be as kenspeckle in a kilt as in a kirtle he may pass for as douce a campbell honest man as locheden himsel my father went this morning to a small huntinglodge and having accidentally left luath behind one of the lads who attended him ran back to desire that unless my cousin should follow him tomorrow which it must be my care to prevent the dog might be sent after him in the morning luckily the messenger met janet before arriving at the castle and after delivering his message to her returned immediately to his master so that if your route sir should lie in that direction or in whatsoever direction your route may lie for it avill be better for both of us that i should remain in my present ignorance your safety will be best assured by taking luatb who is known to the whole country and a note from myself to my father which would be your wanant with any parties of the soldiery whom you might chance to meet so soon as you shall be clear of present danger set luath free he will speedily iii home and his appearance dll be a token a most welcome token of your safety should you be taken i rely upon your honour to declare my dear fathers ignorance of this transaction my own share in it i am ready to abide once again and with deep emotion he for whose sake she was risking so much and who felt that she was herself fully conscious of the peril which she incurred lifted her hand to his lips as she stood on the ledge of rock at the entrance of the cave ready to attempt the precipitous descent a poor and homeless fugitive thanks you madam the result of a more fortunate attempt may one day enable him to return in his own behalf or in that of him whom he represents some part of this obligation when that time shall arrive send but a leaf of this flower sand he plucked a lingering blossom of the wild briar that straggled into the cave and presented it to her marion turned towards him with gentle dignity god forbid that any wild and idle words should lessen the readiness and satisfaction with which i tender my poor assistance to an enemy in distress but if any circumstance could diminish those feelings it would be the finding him even in this moment of extremest wretchedness when the blood of his bravest friends is flowing like water and the lives of weak and helpless women are perilled by the endeavour to save him from a similar fate looking forward with exulting hope to a renewal of these scenes of agony oh sir if you be as your words import of high and legitimate influence with him in whose name this expedition has been carried on represent to him the utter desolation which it has brought upon this unhappy land warn him against incurring for that thorny wreath a crown the tremendous responsibility of another such convulsions whatever be the abstract justice of his claim the truest titles to a throne the blessing of god and the love of the people rest with the house of brunswick and he and his gallant son will find a nobler greatness a sweeter peace in a patient acquiescence in the will of providence and the voice of the nation than in efforts which can but end in the slaughter of their bravest and their most faithful followers and in rending asunder the ties of friendship and of kindred from the castle to the hut save this devoted country from the recurrence of scenes heartrending alike to friend and to foe and take with you my prayers and my blessings blushing at her own earnestness she stopped suddenly i accept your flower added she in calmer tone not as an emblem yet see the leaves are already falling but as a memorial janet and luath shall be with you as soon as they can steal away after nightfall farewell and attended by her faithful adherents she stepped into the narrow bed formed by the waters and slowly and cautiously gained the path beneath strange yet noble creature muttered the fugitive to himself as he stood at the entrance of the cavern watching her descent she has not made any promise of secrecy but one feels that a woman like that might be trusted with vol ii e more tliaii life faith one might envy the elector of hanover and captain archibald campbell such a subject and such a mistress the rose was dropping did she say flowers are but foolish emblems there is an eagle one of the same sort that hovered above the vessel as we approached the scottish shore tulli jardine pointed it out to me at the time that were a fitter symbol and that sails on and catching as ambition is wont to catch at such auguries he watched the flight of the kingly bird soaring upward until it was lost in the distance and then cheered by the omen retired into his place of refuge with his usual sang froid where excellent as he had himself boasted at making a shift he speedily kindled some dry sticks by snapping the lock of his pistol </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> pistol and setting light by that means to the stump of a tobacco pipe lengthened sufficiently for use by the insertion of a tube of oaten straw applied himself vigorously to the task of stifling the sense of present ennui and future danger and the still more pressing claims of a keen appetite in the fames of the fragrant weed marion on her part flushed and agitated contrived to reach home unsuspected she walked straight into the small room that she was accustomed to call her parlour which contained what little property a highland lady of that day could call her own and miss marion campbells possessions in that way were the admiration of argyleshire she boasted besides the ordinary complement of highbacked chas narrow settees and diminutive teatables a harpsichord a escritoire surmounted with glass doors serving at once for invitingdesk and bookcase and furnished with the usual limited female library a japan 2 cabinet well stuffed with choice china mixed with divers curiosities natural and artificial of questionable beauty and not remarkable for preservation a glass case of gorgeous humming birds and a gilt cage containing a recent gift of her cousin a bullfinch of great tameness and such extraordinary accomplishments that he not only drew his own water in an ingenious bucket constructed for the purpose but attested his loyalty by piping very successfully the whole of the national anthem from the first bar to the last and had completely won the old pipers affections by making certain indistinct and faroff efforts to catch the notes of the gathering of the clan as performed by him for a full hour every morning walking up and down in front of the hall door dutch tiles decorated the chimney india paper covered the walls and the little apartment had a look of snugness hi and comfort hardly to have been expected amongst the wild hills of the north the starry white jessamine the everlasting pea and the hardy purple clematis the favoured flower that bears the name of virgins bower were trained round the windows and a half glass door opened upon a sheltered flowerplot bordered with thrift and gay with pinks lark spurs sweetwilliams and garden lilies intermixed with tall rose trees and care f allytrained bushes of dutch honeysuckle each almost as short and quite as round as a dutch cheese whilst another door on the opposite side of the room led by a narrow winding staircase to her sleeping chamber above it was a very complete ladys apartment although most of the advantages of its insulation and its power of egress from the castle without the knowledge of the other inhabitants had hitherto been thrown away upon its fair possessor she now decided that janet and luath should pass through the glass door when setting forth en their moonlight expedition there was to be sure a wall round one side of the little flower garden into which it opened whilst on the other it sank abruptly to the lake from which her father derived his territorial title but that wall was in so precarious a state and janet so strong and active that there was little doubt of her surmounting the difficulty as to luath he would clear it at a bound sunny and cheerful was marions little parlour with its indoor comforts and luxuries and its outdoor prettiness its pleasant garden and its sidelong peep of the calm clear waters shut in by sheltering hills and cheerful and simony had been the temper with which the young scottish maiden highborn healthful and fair the beloved and only daughter of a kind and indulgent father the betrothed bride of the man whom she loved best in the world had been wont to return to it to pursue her ordinary avocations after her daily ramble among the mountains or by the lake side iow her mood was changed anxious uneasy unquiet the secret with which she had become acquainted a secret which she felt must be imparted to no one save her faithful janet must be held sacred at every risk weighed upon her like a sin she sate down to her escritoire with the double purpose of depositing in one of its little recesses the halffallen rose for with the softened feeling so natural to a woman when rendering at a great risk a great service she had already relented towards him by whom it had been presented and of writing the important billet which with luath was to form his passport but harassed with doubts whether in following the impulse of the moment she had done right or wrong and weighed down by the horrible responsibility belonging to her situation she had no sooner folded the flower carefully in silver paper and cleared one of the pigeonholes for its reception than with an irresistible movement of seepity mingled it may be with a shade of selfdistrust she laid her head upon her hand and burst into tears her heart somewhat relieved by that great female comfort and privilege a hearty fit of crying she lifted up her head with the intention of writing her letter forthwith and chasing the subject as much as might be from her mind when her attention was arrested by a packet which she had dislodged from its place in depositing the tokenflower and which had unrolled itself in falling and now lay open before her eyes it was a watercolour drawings of great finish and beauty executed by helen and representing the two friends in a glen near the castle marion richly dressed was seated in the foreground one little hand thrown round the neck of the faithful luath whose honest countenance always animated and intelligent was awakened into double life by the report of dun gallants gun whose figure was seen farther down the glen firing at a red deer bounding by helen had drawn herself in profile standing behind her companion accoutred in plaid and bodice as a highland lassie and setting off by her darker complexion and simpler garb the delicate and swanlike loveliness of the young beauty of locheden even in this picture the unselfish and amiable character of the artist might be traced herself eminently handsome she had cast into the shade her own graceful figure and noble features and had given all her care to heighten the charms of her friend marions spirits already weakened could not resist the flood of recollection that burst upon her at sight of this drawing and of some stanzas which had served it for an envelope slight but graceful verses in which the poet had mingled with fond praises of his sisters skill as a portrait paint ter very intelligent hints of his own devotion to the fair original poor helen sighed she poor poor dungallan the sigh was echoed from behind her and turning round with a shock of nervous trepidation she saw her cousin archibald leaning upon her chair i beg your pardon miss campbell for daring to look over you said he somewhat stiffly but having after despatching answers to communications of some consequence sought you in your usual works and receiving upon my returning to the castle the most contradictory answers to my questions as to your whereabout i was tempted by the open door and the sight of my friend luath to use my old privilege of the entree and make my appearance in your withdrawing room old angus informed me that you were walking and well mistress janet on the contrary said that you were at home and indisposed and without intending believe me to intrude upon meditations which were clearly not intended to meet the general eye i could not resist the temptation to inquire personally which of the two reports was correct both were right to a certain point said marion with some effort i walked out as i generally do after breakfast and returned not ill indeed but less well than usual it pleased mistress janet to deny that you had bean out at all persisted archibald drily eyeing with no good will the waiting damsel who had by this time made her way into the apartment and was busying herder in collecting her ladys bonnet and shawl however to let that matter rest i wished to warn you against rambling about unattended at this particular time intelligence has been received that one of the prime leaders in this rebellion the very chief over whose portrait conjoined with your own i find you weeping has been traced to this neighbourhood eh sirs dungallan goodness save him pair chielfrae the bloody redcoats was the ejaculation of janet whether there be more truth in the exploded doctrine of sympathies than it suits the philosophers of this enlightened age to admit continued archibald doggedly or whether trio interest which you and mistress janet there are pleased to testify in this fate together with this mysterious walk may serve to solve the </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> the enigma of his lurking about a place so remote from his own country and apparently surrounded by enemies remains to be determined at all events the coincidence is curious my grateful affection for his sister the daughter of my poor mothers dearest friend the friend and instructress of my own childhood might well account for any interest that i might take in dungallans fate said marion rousing herself as she perceived the effect which her passive dejection and silent acquiescence in his suspicions was producing upon the jealous temper of her lover if he fell a victim to these cruel cruel laws poor helens happiness would be ruined for ever sisters are convenient persons observed captain campbell i am unfortunate in not possessing one although even if i were happy enough to boast a relation as accomplished as miss helen cameron i should lack the skill to set off her presents with a garnish of love verses i am none of these same metre balladlonger thank heaven added he with increasing bitterness i am of hotspurs mind and had rather hear a brazen candlestick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would nothing set my teeth on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry as for my walk this morning began marion desirous of turning the conversation that fettered by the recollection of all that had passed in that mornings walk and heartstruck by the sternness of his gaze her voice faltered and she suddenly stopped what have i done archibald that you should look at me and speak to me so unkindly said she after a short pause turning to him with the tears streaming down her cheeks and a sweetness and earnestness of manner that won its way instantly to the lovers heart he soothed and apologised and before they parted to dress for dinner a perfect reconciliation had taken place and he had vowed for the fiftieth time never again to suffer a shade of jealousy to pass across his mind such vows are easily made but to keep them requires a cooler temperament than that of archibald campbell twenty times that very afternoon was the stifled passion upon the brink of bursting forth we must all have felt even although we may have been fortunate enough not to have a secret of life and death in our charge like poor marion how difficult it i when the mind is filled with one subject to keep up an easy and unembarrassed conversation upon any other the more especially when our companion is one to whom we have been accustomed to confide every thought as it happened to arise in such a situation not only is our behaviour embarrassed and constrained but there is a sort of spell over our faculties so that in steering clear of the one great danger we run foul of all sorts of minor perils and say and do we hardly know what ina vain endeavour to cover the awkwardness of our real position in the present case for instance marion affected an exuberance of animal spirits depressing rather than exhilarating to the listener and as different from her general easy cheerfulness as the rouge of a haggard court beauty from the natural coloring of youth and health she rattled on the harpsichord with a rapidity which put melody quite out of the question the liveliest tunes that she could recollect sang in a voice from which her usual arch sweetness was banished by agitation the gayest of her national songs choosing quite unconsciously to herself but in a manner which her auditor did not fail to remark such airs as she had been accustomed to sing with helen and those which had been the particular favourites of her brother and when at last she had quite exhausted herself with the exertion she rose from the harpsichord and taking up the apron that she was flowering requested that he would read to her while she worked as dungallan used to do to helen it was now the captains turn to show that a tetetete between two lovers is not always so saccharine a matter as is erroneously supposed turning over the newest books that he could find amongst her collection he lighted upon eichardsons great novel then in course of publication the unknown catas vol ii f trophies of which excited so much curiosity and interest not merely amidst the flowerbed of young ladies by whom the author was surrounded but amongst some score of persons of quality who despatched letter after letter one of them lady bradshaw even writing upon her knees to ask for the reformation of the hero and a happy conclusion to the story with as earnest supplications and as strong reasons to back their petition as if they had been pleading for the real actual lifelong felicity of two real actual living and existing human beings the strongest tribute by the way to the power of the book to its extraordinary verisimilitude and truthfulness ever received by any author one of lovelaces most characteristic letters did captain campbell address himself to read avoiding with the instinct of a highbred gentleman all that could be painful to female delicacy and giving to the racy wit the eloquent sophistry of that remarkable creation of eichardsons genius all the advantage of the most intelligent and animated elocution so that marions attention was excited in spite of herself what a wretch exclaimed she ashe finished the account of one of his most teazing interviews with poor clarissa what a cruel unfeeling coldhearted wretch i i dont know that replied archibald be it remembered in vindication of my hero that only four volumes out f the eight had yet been published and that lovelaces final resolution was still in suspense i dont know that the lady seems to me to have been quite as coldhearted as the gentleman or rather hearts on both sides seem to have been pretty much out of the question she justly as you will say distrusted his honour and he with at least as much justice doubted of her affection the whole affair seems to me a game of chess at which barring false moves which it is the authors business to guard against the most skilful player will be sure to prove victorious all you ladies exclaim poor clarissa and if she had loved him i should be as ready as the best of you to echo the cry but love is synonymous with confidence and this paragon of her sex does not know what the word means if she had relied upon him if she had trusted him one wonders that eichardson did not see how much his book would have gained in interest by representing clarissa as enamoured of lovelace but he lives amongst ladies and piques himself it is said upon his knowledge of the female heart and therefore it is not wonderful that he should show them as he sees them and as they are added he bitterly delighting in tormenting those that love them best poor clarissa indeed rather poor lovelace at this moment it was some relief to marion whose apron had certainly not improved by her afternoons labours that the weather which had been louring all the afternoon now assumed the appearance of one of the terrific storms of those mountain regions the evening closed in prematurely the clouds gathered dark and heavy the wind moaned in gusts through the dark firs and swept across the lake whilst quick flashes of sharp rapid lightning gleamed at the edge of the horizon and the growl of distant thunder proclaimed in natures fullest voice the gathering of the coming tempest the momentary passions of men were hushed before it the lover sate contemplating by the fitful glare of the lightning the fair face of his beloved pallid and sad from anxiety and sorrow and once again his heart smote him for his unkindness marion dearest marion do not you play the distrustful maiden nth me who heaven knows have no desire upon this earth but your happiness and honour be frank with me confide in me i conjure you i see i loiow that there is a secret that weighs upon your mind at this moment trust it to me and you shall not repent your reliance shew me but what you wish and it shall be done my power in this district is greater than you know of my intelligence more accurate than you suspect say only dungallan is my friends brother and therefore i wish to save him say even dungallan is my own early friend and he shall be saved only think me worthy of jour confidence and see how i will deserve it say even although the thought be fatal to my every hope of happiness even if his danger have revealed to you feelings hitherto unsuspected and if in aiding his </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> his escape i give assistance to a favoured rival yet for your dear sake to spare you the misery you would feel if lie were taken i swear to befriend him at whatever peril it maybe i am not now on service and there is only one of those unfortunate fugitives whom it would be eternal dishonour for a soldier to preserve for dungallan since your happiness seems bound up in his safety i will not hesitate to risk rank fortune life itself only trust me only confide in me if not as your devoted lover yet as your nearest kinsman your truest friend speak to me i conjure you marion i beseech you speak he hung over her affectionately as he delivered with an earnest truthfulness that could not be mistaken this outburst of fond and disinterested love gazing in her face as he spoke and grasping withall the fervour of passion her cold and trembling hands will you not answer me do you disdain even to reply to my offer of service my most sincere and honest offer you do i see plainly that you do i see and feel too plainly that you desire my absence and i will no longer intrude upon your privacy farewell madam may you find a truer and a more devoted heart than that which you have spurned from you and lingering a moment on the threshold in the hope it may be of being recalled he left the room marion wrung her hands in bitterness of vexation soever had her heart so yearned towards the kinsman the friend the betrothed bridegroom whom she had suffered to leave her probably for ever oh that i dared to undeceive him but for his own sake i dare not i must not i have pledged myself to this adventure and i must abide the trial may the god of mercy who lias willed that we should assist a fellow creature in distress who has gifted woman with a strength of sympathy which almost counterbalances her feebleness of body may he grant that i bear it with firmness it is a fearful night janet continued she addressing the faithful soubrette who just now entered the apartment janet do you fear to encounter the storm if you do say so honestly and i will go myself i have no right to impose upon your kindness and fidelity a danger from which i should shrink there is little left heaven knows that should make me cling to life speak frankly my good iii if your heart fails you say so at once janets answer was bold and confident and somewhat soothed by the fearless readiness of her confidante her predictions that they should succeed in their enterprise and that all jealousies and suspicions would be ultimately cleared up for her acuteness did not fail to detect the chief source of her ladys despondency marion sat down to write with more firmness than she had expected to be able to command the important billet to her father which in case of the fugitive being intercepted by the soldiers would she believed from the respect paid to the name of one of the most loyal and most powerful chiefs of the powerful and loyal house of campbell prove an effectual and unquestionable passport her letter was short and simple stating only that as captain archibald campbell had resolved not to join locheden in his hunting expedition she had sent luath by the bearer that all was well at the castle and that wishing good sport to her dear father she hoped to see him return in a few days armed with this document and laden vrith the promised provisions the venison pasty and the whisky lifted to use janets own phrase together with a certain pair of shoon belonging to her lover donald plaid garments of the campbell set and a collar and chain for luath the faithful waiting damsel followed by the no less faithful hound took the opportunity of a lull in the storm to set forth upon her expedition marion accompanied them as far as the garden wall which janet and her forfeited attendant cleared with somewhat more of difficulty than she had anticipated and then returned alone to her solitary apartment to start at every sound and feel each moment as it passed marked by the beatings of her own anxious heart sadly and wearily the hours dragged along the tempest had returned with tenfold violence and marion as she found the noises in the castle subsiding one by one giving token that the inhabitants had retired to rest and that she remained the only watcher within its walls whilst over the pelting rain and moaning wind without burst ever and anon peals of thunder reverberating in awful grandeur amongst the mountains preceded by lightning that glared with livid and horrible lustre through the room began to feel the pressure of a closeclinging fear a downweighing responsibility as the possible fate of her attached dependent flashed across her mind if her courage should give way as she returned alone and she should fall in the darkness from the ledge of the rock if the springs on the hilltop should rise suddenly and joining the gatherings from the pouring rain gush down the channel of the winter watercourse if she should be struck by the lightning either of these thoughts was too terrible to dwell upon the distant clap of a door within the mansion followed as she thought for the dizzying bounding of her own pulses the throbbing of her heart and brain were such as to confuse all outward sounds by the rapid footsteps of a man along the galleries and through the vaulted passages of the old building harbingers yet another fear if janet should be pursued if she should be intercepted if the stranger should be discovered she heard or she thought she heard the castle gate unfastened and the feeling of suspense becoming insupportable she ventured to open gently the door of her little parlour when a rush of wind as if from an outer door left open extinguished her taper and left her in all the horror that a darkness as of midnight interrupted only by the now less frequent flashes of the lightning could add to her former terror the storm was at length abating she found her way to the glass door and opened it and after an interval that seemed to last hours rather than minutes she was aware of luath as he came bounding up the path followed could it be the footsteps of two persons that she heard advancing with stealthy rapidity a moment decided the question janet rushed fearfully in dragging after her her as it seemed unwilling companion and first carefully locking and bolting the door and barring the shutters an operation which in spite of the darkness she performed with singular dexterity she then contrived to thrust the stranger for it was no other up the staircase leading to marions sleeping apartment and having locked that door also and deposited the key in her pocket began relating to her lady in cautious whispers but with her usual volubility the causes which had induced her to resolve upon the bold measure of bringing him to the castle they had been pursued the rain had rendered the descent from the cave so dangerous and had so flooded the path below that the fugitive forgetting his own danger in the manly duty of protecting a female had insisted in spite of janets earnest remonstrances on escorting her as far at least as the wall over which she had effected her exit from the castle gardens the light shielded from the action of the wind by an ingeniouslycontrived lanthorn of oiled paper by the aid of which he had contrived to obtain for her a safe footing down the face of the precipice had she imagined been observed from the upper windows of the castle certain it was that before they reached the spot to which the fugitive had insisted upon accompanying her they had heard footsteps at some distance behind them and had as the clouds partially cleared away and the moon emerged for a few moments been enabled to perceive that their pursuer was a soldier janet declared her conviction that it must be either captain archie himsel or the loud donald come to reclaim the plaids and shoon which she had boasted with so much glee of having lifted from her military admirer a few hours before some one from the house it certainly was for luath had recognized him and giving a sudden jerk to the chain by which he was held had succeeded in freeing himself and bounding towards the intruder although he had returned to them upon hearing her voice under these circumstances the active waitingmaid had with great presence of mind availed herself of a stunted pollard oak </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> oak which concealed and facilitated the passage over the wall to the garden and first dashing away the telltale light had literally hauled up after her both her companions each of whom had for a wonder as she observed been gifted with sufficient sense to submit to her guidance iii bea that weary lantern quoth janet i tempt the gentleman gin he wad stay quiet i the cave id nae fear o getting safe to the foot o the rock wi my plaids rowed round me and name to look on i should hae slid down the path ye ken like a saw wreath at yule but he wadna be guidit im minded that hes ane that has taen his ain gate owe lang weel but ye maun hae a light and off she ran finding her way through the darkness with the security and ease which seems one of the many privileges of the lighthearted and the fearless during her absence a fresh perplexity occurred to her mistress horses were heard galloping into the court and a violent knocking at the gate was succeeded by a parley between captain archibald and the visitors the voice of one of them was she thought familiar to lier and to her unspeakable consternation she found that he was advancing with janet towards the apartment janet talking at the top of her voice to give notice of his approach to her lady foot the night general xa indeed hae we not except indeed to ca luath poor hound whos aye ganging forth in the rain sae my teddy and i we got a wee wet and the wind put out the taper and sae whilst janet thus followed her instinct as a ladys maid and lied her companion general campbell closely followed by archibald stepped forward into the room where marion sate trembling with anxiety and apprehension i intrude upon you only for an instant my fair cousin late as is the hour and indisposed as i regret to see you are merely to announce to you that i shall tomorrow early be obliged to steal away your visitor whose presence is required in edinburgh to meet his brother and lord and lady bellasis and their pretty daughter lady betty give my compliments to locheden and tell him we have accounts of the rebel chief dungallan one of the ringleaders having ventured into argyles country tell him that we have taken care of the land passes and that we shall borrow the castle boat in the morning to despatch a messenger across the loch and now good night go to bed my dear and refresh your roses i dont like those pale cheeks and with a kind pressure of the hand the good general quitted the apartment archibald lingered behind you hear that dungallan that this favoured friend i presume you call him has been traced into this neighbourhood that he is even supposed to be upon this estate why do i speak of reports and suppositions when i know that he is here added captain campbell impressively g 2 marion campbell you are mistaken indeed you are mistaken rejoined his cousin mistaken when i saw him enter the garden this very night when i can track his footsteps across this room when here is his glove dropped upon the floor dropped at the very door which leads to your bedchamber and to your bedchamber only cried he bitterly flinging from him with violence the glove which he had picked up the rebel is here and i know not what weakness hinders me from doing my duty as an officer in the kings service and delivering him up at once to the general do as seems best to you captain campbell said marion faintly my life and far more than my life my reputation are in your power deal with me as you will nay madam your safety and the honour of my kinsmans house must ever be sacred in my eyes unkindly cruelly as you have treated me i cannot forget what we once were to each other i warn you however that escape is impossible you will live to repent this nights work farewell for ever and without even a parting glance he hurried out of the room ye are mair like to repent this nights work yersel captain observed janet quietly as she bolted the door after him and addressed herself to the double task of comforting her lady and releasing the prisoner gin the landpasses be waylaid we maun try the loch ill gie a gay guess that the castle bathe 11 be mission the morn and so it was managed in less than two hours the stranger accompanied by luath was rowing across the loch whilst at daybreak the next morning general campbell and archibald took their departure for edinburgh time dragged heavily on luath lead returned weary and travelstained without either his absence or his arrival having excited any suspicion in the castle nothing had been heard of the letter and marion had the satisfaction of believing that the sacrifice of her happiness had not been made in vain that she had at least succeeded in rescuing the object of her compassion locheden had upon his return found his daughter sick and drooping and as days lengthened into vieeks and weeks into months and left the prolonged absence of her lover unexplained the old chief began to chafe with anger and impatience he had heartily approved of a match which would unite his only child to the heirmale to whom in default of a son his own estate would descend and who besides his personal good gifts and his high reputation for gallantry and military skill inherited in right of his english mother a property wliicli might be reckoned enormous for a highlander in those days but this neglect of one whom he regarded as the very apple of his eye awakened all the irritability of his nature and his fierce displeasure added tenfold as that particular way of proving affection commonly does add to the distress of her by whose injuries real or supposed his wrath had been originally excited affairs were in this position when one fine morning in october despatches arrived from general campbell calculated to increase if that were possible the previous exasperation after announcing his intention to visit locheden almost as soon as his letter could reach them accompanied by their young kinsmen captain archibalds next brother john being an officer in his own regiment he proceeded to say you will have heard i am sure with great pleasure for i take for granted that the bridegroom elect has apprised you of his good fortune of our gallant cousins intended marriage with lady betty bellasis the english heiress and beauty who has made so great a sensation in edinburgh this summer there have been difficulties of course upon the score of fortune and country with the earl and countess but love has conquered them all and the chief object of our journey to locheden is to consult you the kinsman guardian and friend to whom both these young men are so deeply indebted upon the arrangements as to residence and settlements which this happy event will render necessary the bridegroom elect is in every way a lucky fellow in addition to her fortune and her beauty la future is as charming a creature as one shall see on a summers day a fit companion for your sweet marion my pet and favourite heaven send them happy together a lowlander an englishwoman an heiress fortunehunter rascal scoundrel that he is exclaimed the old chieftain throwing from him the unlucky letter and striding up and down the hall in breathless wrath and the doited idiot of a general to even her with my marion the sassenach doll let them take care how they speak of my daughter old as i am the blood of mcallamore runs as red in my veins as in theirs only let them dare to lightly her and the very excess and fierceness of his anger took away the power of expression marion listened tremblingly delaying till calmer moments any attempts to soothe and expostulate coming are they burst forth the enraged father coming ay by heaven continued he catching a glimpse of a party of horsemen approaching the castle here they come and they think to find entrance do they added lie bitterly they come to take account of our accommodations that they may bring their braw young bride to insult over the old man and his daughter let them wait until i be dead not a foot shall that villain set in locheden until he walks over ray corpse angus duncan where are the loons loitering see that the gates be barred let none enter stay i implore you i conjure you my dearest father for my peace and happiness for the honour and

see no difference surely you will not vex and grieve your poor child yield to me in this i implore you dearest father i and she threw her arms round his neck leaned her head on his shoulder and wept he kissed her with the fondest affection you are an angel my darling and shall have your own away in everything compare an english moppet with my noble marion the scoundrel will be miserable thats my comfort his father married a lowlander for the sake of the silver a peevish southron dame that worried the life fairly out of him and so will this great laddie we are weel rid o the loon dungallan puis laddie s avorth twenty of him hes won safe to france ye ken to his sister and gin we can save the estate from the clutches of thaeenglishers said the old chieftain losing ds english as he lost his temper and checking himself as lie perceived the effect his hint produced upon his daughter weel aveel well no talk of that the now you shall see how civil ill be to the villain ill no condescend to be angry ill take a lesson out of his ain book and be as cause and fair as himsel here the rascal comes you shall see how doubly ill behave eh now that sic a perjured traitor should look so like an honest man that locheden fully intended his behaviour to be as false and fair as he believed his kinsman there is no manner of doubt but the inveterate truthfulness of threescore years was too much for his new resolution he did not it is true bar his gates against his visitors nor kick them out of doors being entered but he drew back haughtily from their proffered hands with a look as fierce and wild as one of his own mountain eagles and eyed archibald in particular as if he had a mind to knock him down general campbell a kind and acute person and a man of the world saw at a glance that something was amiss and determining not to enter upon family matters imtil the aspect of affairs should be somewhat cleared began after an affectionate expression of regret at marions pale cheeks to talk over the news of the day you have heard the grand piece of intelligence i presume locheden that this foolish young man the pretender who has occasioned us so much trouble in chasing him up and down the country has given us the slip at last and got clear off to france the thing is really so besides the accounts in the public papers which are sufficiently precise and particular i have a letter myself from a french friend the comte de clement who actually saw him land why heyday my pretty marion quoth the good general observation carpbell ing the involuntary clasping of lier hands and the sudden rush of blood that coloured her fair face to the brow as she listened to his words with breathless interest what should there be in this news to make you brighten up on a sudden you are no damsel of the white rose i hope no flora mdonald exploits here eh locheden and he turned to relate to the chief all that was then known of the escape of charles edward whilst archibald to whom her emotion was as a flash of light that showed him the whole thing at a glance advanced to his fair cousin he then and not dungallan was the stranger at the cave charles edward the pretender the chevalier the prince iay give him what title you will i am no damsel of the white rose as the general calls it although i risked much ay and would risk much again to preserve a fugitive in peril of his life thrown under such extraordinary circumstances upon my poor resources for protection and assistance but why not intrust me with the secret why occasion so much unnecessary pain certainly to me may i not say to both of us to laye trusted you captain campbell an officer in the service of the king of england with such a secret as that however the confidence might have relieved and comforted myself would have been to endanger your professional reputation your honour perhaps even your life neo i cannot think that i was wrong the more especially added she in a lower voice and with peculiar sweetness and gentleness of manner the more especially as the transient pain must have been long forgotten in your late and present happiness heaven knows i congratulate you most sincerely happiness congratulate echoed captain campbell in unfeigned astonishment marion my dow said her father striding rapidly across the room i have done a great injustice its no our friend here but johnny his brother thats about to marry lady betty who seems to be a fine spunky lassie for all she has the ill luck to be an english archie my lad i crave your pardon for thinking you could be such a villain and the old chief and the young soldier shook hands with hearty affection and goodwill there has been a small mistake on both sides as it seems observed general campbell joining the little group but matters are clearing up now to judge from the gentlemans smiles and the ladys blushes and if i be permitted to advise the best way to prevent a recurrence of doubts and misgivings would be to have both the weddings on the same day what say you mistress janet for that faithful dependent very anxious upon her ladys account and it may be a little inquisitive upon her own had contrived on some pretence or other to edge herself into the room what say you i gie my consent responded janet barring jealousy and a sic nonsense for the time to come the captain and the loud donald faith ken that i forewarned them what yon nights work would come to but ye men folk are aye rash and headstrong ye canna help yourselves its born wi ye and we women are sat and complying thats our nature sae sin ye hae repent we maun een forgive ye quoth janet an tak ye for better for worse and so it was settled vol n gone to be married i gone to swear a peace shakspeare lii on liquid roses floating so floats yon foam oer pink champagne fain would i join such pleasant boating and prove that ruby main and float away on wine those seas are dangerous gray beards swear whose seabeach is the goblets brim and true it is they drown old care but what care we for him so we but float on wine and true it is they cross in pain who sober cross the stygian ferry but only make our styx champagne and we shall cross right merry floating away on wine old charons self shall make him mellow then gaily row his boat from shore while we and every jovial fellow hear unconcerned the oar that dips itself in wine so you really wrote this giovanni said the young and pretty beatrice alberti as she sat on a terrace of her brothers villa overlooking the yah d arno sing it to me i want to hear it in your own voice can antonio play the air i was originally indebted for this anacreontic almost an impromptu to a friend whom i am proud to name mr kenyon and although it has since been printed in a collection of his own poems i cannot find in my heart to play my readers false by substituting an inferior song of my own h 2 and the little page ran rapidly over the notes and then accompanied the contes rich mellow baritone voice in a melody as rich and flowing as the verses both the singing and the playing were full of right italian taste and the fair florentine charmed with both the words and the air was evidently not a little proud of her gay and gallant brother whose talent as a poet she had never even suspected well said giovanni when he had concluded will this do beatrice will that anacreontic win me the laurel wreath tonight at the palazzo eiccardi think you beatrice started from her seat in astonishment you go to the palazzo piccardi you contend for the laurel crown you giovanni alberti who since you were the height of antonio there have done nothing but laugh at that </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> that old precieiise the marchesa with her pedants and her poets and all the trumpery of all the delia etruscans transported into a ladys saloon i you are making a fool of me brother you never can mean it i am perfectly in earnest i assure you replied the conte looking or rather trying to look as grave as an habitually joyous and hilarious temperament would permit i have repented of my sins of scoffing and mockery and mean to make that venerable priestess of the muses all possible amends by enacting the part of her monsieur trissotin her homme ds esprit y with this great lawsuit pending too a suit which if you gain it will leave that sweetlooking creature her daughter every one speaks so well of that pretty gentle bianca little better than a beggar why it would be like the story of one of the montecchi in the house of the capulet in times of old think of that dismal tragedy and then our uncle the cardinal what would he say think of him there are no tragedies nowadays beatrice at least none of the eomeo and giulietta description they have left off happening and as to our dearly beloved uncle he is a man of peace and also with reverence be it spoken a man of contrivance leave his eminence to me go i shall and ill wager the antique gem that you were wishing for the other day do you remember the psyche against your doves that i bring home the prize i see continued he gaily that you think my verses are too good to please that fantastical assembly and perhaps you are right but good or bad they will answer my purpose and you shall confess yourself that my wager is won so saying the lighthearted cavalier nodded to his sister and departed carolling as he went the refrain of his own song floating away on wine five minutes saw him prancing on his mettled barb a fiery roan whose gay curvets and sudden bounds showed to great advantage his noble owners horsemanship for the young conte alberti was by common reputation as well as in the estimate of his fond sister reckoned amongst the most accomplished cavaliers of florence and a very short space of time found him passing through the lung arno on his way to his splendid home in the piazza del grandpa regarding with the indifference of an accustomed eye and a preoccupied mind the spacious yet tranquil town whose size compared with its population and whose fortified palaces are so striking to strangers as well as the magnificent groups in bronze and marble mere copies of which enrich the museums of other nations whilst the originals are the familiar and outdoor treasures of the city of the medici little thought our friend giovanni passing them at fullspeed on his fullblooded barb of palace or of statue and as kettle some few hours after when pacing in the twilight the church of santa croce did he heed even while looking them in the face the monuments of galileo of machiavelli or of him who wore so nobly the triple crown of art the sculptor painter architect michael angelo buonarotti his thoughts were on other matters ay there is the good father safe enough until he be wanted i warrant him cried he gazing complacently upon a round rosy goodhumoured brother of the order of st francis drowsily ensconced beside a dimlylighted shrine perbacco the monte pulciano hath done its good office look if he have not fallen asleep over his beads a comfortable nap to thee father paolo stay there till i come to rouse thee and off danced the mercurial conte murmuring his old burden floating away floating away floating away on wine a bluestocking party loses nothing of its proverbial dulness in the marble halls of italy and the assembly gathered together in the marchesas magnificent saloon that is to say that very important part of such an assembly the listeners were roused from a state of drowsihood scarcely inferior to that of father paolo by the unexpected entrance of the young heir of the alberti in the palace of the eiccardi it was a most animating sensation the appearance of a montagu amongst the festivities of the capulet was nothing toit the commerce of flattery for the important business of the evening had not yet begun suddenly ceased and the foundress of these classical amusements a fade and faded lady emulous of her of the golden violet who sat on a fauteuil slightly elevated with the laurelwreath on its crimson velvet cushion laid upon a small table of rich mosaic before her and two starched and withered dames of the noble houses of mozzi and gemini at her side stopped short in the middle of a compliment with which as in duty bound she was repaying the adulation of one of the competitors for the prize and started between horror and astonishment as if she had been confronted by an apparition our modern eomeo however was not a man to be unbounded by the amazement of a great lady or awestricken by her displeasure he advanced with a mixture of gaiety and gallantry an assured yet winning grace which for the moment at least the stately marchesa found irresistible and professing himself an humble aspirant at the court of the muses come todo homage to their fair representative took his station at the back of her chair and listened with smiling attention to the competitors for the wreath it was perhaps the very worst period of italian literature before alfieri had come in his might to renew the old strength and power of the sweetest of modern languages and when the versifiers of the day the wordcatchers who lived on syllables confined themselves to mere verbal quiddities and the most feeble and trivial imitations of the worst parts the only parts that such mimics can hope to catch of the great poets of a preceding age signer eicci a lean yellow shrivelled anatomy began the recitations with squeaking forth a canzone to angelina all bristling with concerts after the manner as he was pleased to say of petrarch and was followed by a wild sallow pseudo enthusiast who declaimed with astounding vociferation and gesticulation an unfinished and seemingly interminable dream in the involved and difficult triple rhyme which beauty and sublimity apart was in the matter of obscurity pretty truly what it professed to be a fragment in imitation of dante for flickering lights to no one focus brought and mirage mists still baffling thirsty thought and nightmare phantasies from drowsy grot and far similitudes that liken not rhymed plea for tolerance signor puzzi beat signor eicci all to nothing and accordingly he gratified to the highest point the bad taste of this coterie of italian precious and in the midst of trappings of fans and murmurs of admiration of this grand effort of their chosen bard the monsieur trissotin of florence our friend giovanni gently stole off to a quiet corner near the door where sat a sweetlooking little maiden whose black eyes sparkled with innocent pleasure and whose rosy lips curled into irrepressible smiles at his approach she made room for him beside her with a natural simplicity and artlessness that formed a strange contrast with the affectation and minauderie of the rest of the assembly so you are a poet conte alberti said she in a low voice to be sure i am replied he gaily anything that will bring me to you really a poet asked the lady why that is putting my modesty to a very severe test said the gentleman really a poet who may dare answer that question in the affirmative judge for yourself come out into the porch d antonio shall bring his guitar and ill sing the words to his accompaniment you have heard such a serenade before dont you remember our old signal the moon is abroad in her glory tonight mid the deep blue sky and the cloudlets white gaily her beams pierce the vines trellised shade softly they sleep on the long colonnade calm her path in the heavens though the bright orb below still trembles and heaves to the dark rivers flow all lovely things are around us tonight the rose with her perfume the moon with her light and so forth tms song is worth a thousand of that to be sure added he laughing that is not saying much for it but these stanzas are really good only come and hear youll win the prize then i have laid a wager with beatrice that i carry the prize home to her in spite of them all and it will be your fault if i lose only come out into the porch i cant sing here besides i have something important to say to you i want you to help </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> help me sto get rid of our weary lawsuit would not you like to put an end to this unnatural strife and live with beatrice asa sister and friend say from the bottom of my heart would i conte alberti said bianca clasping her hands fervently from the very bottom of my heart and with you too added she with great simplicity come with me now then and i will shew you how it may be managed i beseech you come oh giovanni i cannot i must not we shall be missed see signer puzzi has finished and they are going to call for your poem heaven forfend cried giovanni neo the dangers past young carol is going to declaim a drama a vimprovvista what subject do they give him the judgment of solomon by jove the judgment of solomon now will he turn the marchesa into the queen of sheba and go flattering on for two good hours at the very least they are safe enough now come fairest bianca dearest bianca come well beatrice said giovanni ashe led his pretty wife to his delighted sister is not my wager fairly won the cardinal suggested this catastrophe to our story not indeed the means cospetto they would never have entered his eminences brains but he said a year or two ago that is to say he intimated that if the heir male on one side married the heiress on the other he the aforesaid heir male would have nobody to go to law with but himself i had not then seen my little bianca and therefore i turned a deaf ear to his hints but after i had seen hers and loved her the charmer why then if it had been necessary to gain admittance that i should have constructed as vile a canzone as signer eicci and have dreamed as detestable a dream as signer puzzi and dramatised the judgment of solomon into the bargain id have done it we have sent a dutiful billet to the marchesa and i have no doubt but for joy at getting rid of the lawsuit and out of compliment to my poetical genius she will behave like a reasonable woman the more especially as what is done cannot be undone and all the anger in the world will not mend it so now my fairest beatrice you have nothing todo but to set her the good example of bearing misfortune with philosophy and pay me my wager the doves signora the doves vol n the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold milton it was somewhere in the last quarter of the last century that charles pemberton the younger son of an ancient but impoverished family having committed the oldfashioned folly of marrying a young lady for no better qualifications than beauty sense and goodness without regard to those worldly considerations which modern prudence deems indispensable esteemed himself most fortunate to inherit through the bequest of a distant relative 1 a small estate in the island of ceylon and to obtain a commission in a dutch regiment serving in that colony in which in the course of fourteen or fifteen years he attained the rank of lieutenant colonel living chiefly upon his own property about a mile from the beautiful village of negumbo amongst some of the finest scenery of ceylon which the inhabitants imagine to have been the abode of our first parents the paradise of the old world enjoying an elegant competence and allsufficient to each other colonel and mrs pemberton would have considered themselves blessed beyond the ordinary lot of humanity in spite of their banishment fiom the country they loved so dearly and the society they were so well calculated to adorn but for the great evil of eastern climates the successive deaths of several promising children five fine boys and girls had they followed to the grave and i 2 the only one who now remained to them was their little son william a child remarkable for his affectionate temper his intelligence and his beauty upon whom both parents doted more particularly perhaps his mother whose own health had been considerably injured by the repeated trials which her maternal feelings had undergone no tutor had been provided for willy whom they intended hereafter to send to england for his education meanwhile his father acted as his instructor when at home in the intervals of duty whilst mrs pemberton supplied his place in his absence but the active lively boy was much about in the cinnamon plantation just then beginning to be cultivated by the few british residents on the island which were superintended by a cingalese called yinna a man of remarkable quickness and much apparent fidelity whilst on longer excursions lie was put in charge of a superior domestic servant a malay of the name of gatura who by his pliancy of manner and powers of amusement had greatly ingratiated himself with his young master so implicit was the colonels confidence in these dependents especially in yinna for there was an occasional expression in the dark eye of the malay which recalled to recollection the vindictiveness of his race but such was his reliance upon yinnas integrity and care that it came upon him like no common shock to find having contracted for the sale of some essential oil of cinnamon extracted from such fragments as happen to be broken off in packing up the bales and having seen it actually measured and ready for delivery that halfadozen bottles of this valuable oil which sometimes sells as high as ten pounds british a pint were missing and that upon subjecting all concerned to an examination two of the very peculiar bottles in which the oil had been contained were found in a corner of yinnas hut behind the earthen vessels used for cooking rice whilst another was hidden between the brass basin and the pestle and mortar where the spices are pounded upon the bench which surrounded the apartment and formed with the articles which we have enumerated nearly the whole of its simple furniture the bottles were not merely distinguishable by their fabric and shape but the strong aroma of the precious commodity and even a few drops left in the bottom proved that they had been secretly and hastily emptied of their contents and that yinna the trusted superintendent of this valuable manufactory was himself the thief after one simple but earnest denial of the charge a denial to which his master made no other reply than pointing to the concealed bottles the delinquent attempted no farther defence but resigned himself tranquilly to whatever punishment the laws might decree that extremity was however averted by the intercession of willy whose urgent entreaty for pardon for his friend was so far complied with that colonel pemberton contented himself with dismissing the favourite servant who had set so flagrant an example of dishonesty to the labourers under his charge eemember said his master impressively when paying the wages due to him and discharging him from his service eememberthat i have abstained from punishing you at the earnest solicitations of this child but that if ever you again come before me for any act of theft or fraud the chastisement will be exemplary yinna listened in silent submission kissed the skut of willys garment and departed for a while the boy missed his kind and pleasant face in the cinnamon plantations and about the homegrounds but the griefs of childhood are enviably brief and he had nearly forgotten his old playfellow when he was thrown unexpectedly in his way many months afterwards in a visit paid by himself and his father attended by gatura to the pearlfishery at condatchy a gay and pleasant scene was this pearlfishery thousands of persons of all colours and nations in the picturesque costumes of the east from the rich travelling merchant who supply the great jewellers of our european cities to the poorest of the cingalese women and children who hover around the sieves and pore for days over the heaps of sand which have been thrown aside in the hopes of lighting upon the smallest seedling pearl crowd the streets of the temporary town at other times a mere fishing village washing sifting boring drilling squabbling and bargaining in every variety of dialect and jargon all intent upon the beautiful luxury destined to add a costlier splendour to the monarchs crown or a rarer charm to the brow of beauty willy was delighted all the more delighted that he met his old friend vienna and that yinna had been singularly prosperous a speculating merchant had not only engaged divers on his own account but had employed persons to examine the sand that had been thrown by after passing or being supposed to pass through the sieves vinna had been fortunate enough to discover in a portion which must have been spilled before </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> before being subjected to that process a pearshaped pearl of such size and beauty as had not been found off the coast of ceylon within the memory of the oldest trader connected with the fishery an agent of the king of candy specially despatched by his royal master for the purpose of obtaining such a jewel to gratify a fancy expressed by his favourite yife who wanted such an one to complete a set of ornaments was at that moment treating for it with his employer yinna ran to procure it to show to the boy and placed it on a crimson shawl to display the shape and colour to the best advantage at willys entreaty colonel pemberton also advanced to admire the treasure attended by gatura who had accompanied them to condatchy and a little crowd of merchants and natives gathered round the place enlarging upon its merits marvelling at yinna s good fortune or rather the extraordinary luck of his employer and wondering how by any degree of carelessness a pearl of such magnitude could have escaped from the sieves whilst these assistants in the heat of their discussion stood divided into separate groups and colonel pemberton at willys entreaty was speaking with a grave and measured kindness to yinna his employer and the agent of the king of candy having concluded their bargain returned for the pearl they applied to yinna who motioned to the shawl which he had deposited on the top of a high covered basket close behind him the basket was there and the shawl but the pearl was gone the consternation was general yinna wrung his hands in agony the buyer and seller of the precious commodity were in equal dismay every man looked suspiciously on his fellow some disclaimed some accused gatura who had stood nearest the basket upon which the valuable jewel had been so unhappily left insisted so vehemently upon being searched that rather to pacify him and rid themselves of his clamour than from any positive mistrust his dress and person were as he desired subjected to a very rigorous examination nothing of course being found that could implicate him any way in the delinquency in the meantime the less successful adventurers who had before been loud in the expression of their astonishment that such a pearl could be found in such a manner began to gather round colonel pemberton to examine into the character which yinna whom they understood from what had passed between them to have been heretofore employed by him had borne while in his service the agent of the king of candy the purchaser of the pearl and the speculator who had sold it also approached with the same view willy who child as he was saw the turn that matters were about to take seized the opportunity to steal towards his friend go vinna go said willy and vdth a sudden start and a momentary pause yinna obeyed the injunction he disappeared among the crowd and by the time that the questions of those interested had extracted from colonel pemberton the cause of his dismissal and that two or three of the most determined called out to arrest him he had made such good use of his time as completely to baffle every effort of his pursuers his flight whilst it saved him from almost inevitable punishment producing upon everybody except willy who did battle manfully in his behalf the most complete conviction of his guilt it seemed as certain that he had stolen the pearl perhaps that he had twice stolen it as that he had stolen the oil of cinnamon no one believed in the possibility of his innocence except our friend willy the father and son returned to gumbo and in a little while the colonel was called away on service and mrs pemberton being in delicate health willy was left much to the care of gatura who spared no pains in his endeavour to win the favour of the lively and spirited boy he constructed a pad on which to take him before him on a blood horse belonging to the colonel and carried him every day upon some excursion to the cocoa groves or topes or the dreary forests which surrounded their habitation one day he took him to see the manner in which wild elephants are caught and willy was delighted with the sagacity and affection displayed by one of the tame ones who apparently recognising an old companion in the largest of those that had been ensnared actually opened the fastenings of the gate for the release of his friend thus shewing although enslaved himself iiis sense of the value of freedom willy was enchanted and on gaturas dwelling capon the grandeur and interest of a buffalo hunt never ceased importuning the malay to afford him that gratification one fine morning accordingly they set forth professedly to witness this remarkable spectacle the highbred steed carried them rapidly through the cocoa tope into the very depth of the forest xo sign appeared of the hunters but pleased with the beauty of the scenery the golden rays of the sun darting through the shaddock and the tamarind and resting on the beautiful fruit of the jamboe and amused by the variety of bright coloured birds and gorgeous butterflies the boy took no note of the distance at last as the day advanced the claims began to be felt and he intimated to gatura his desire to return home home said the malay in the low accent of bitter hate you never shall return do you remember the day you child as you are may forget but on my memory that day is burnt in characters of fire when for striking this horse ay it was this very horse as colonel pemberton my master your father was pleased to think over hard he snatched the whip from my hand and struck me ay lashed me with it as if i had been a beast i grasped the crease in my bosom but that would have been a brief and common vengeance i have waited for such revenge as may endure and now my hour is come you too young sir you were pleased to read out of some storybook to your mother that pearls might be hidden in the mouth that stripping the dress and searching the person was no security against a skilful thief home shall you never come to tell your father that tale unless indeed you can win your way through the beasts and reptiles the snakes and the panthers of this forests down with you sir do not cling around me in this manner let go my sash or i will cut away those little hands what noise is that off with you i say and frightened at some real or imaginary noise gatura dashed the struggling child to the earth and rode rapidly away leaving in the boys hands the shawl sash by which he had clung so tightly and which had been folded after the oriental fashion round the waist of the malay a small packet dropped from it it was the lost pearl hungry and bewildered as he was the stout hearted boy lost neither his courage nor his presence of mind he pocketed the precious jewel plucked the unripe fruits to appease the cravings of appetite and tried with all his might to retrace the way by which he had come and to turn back to his home but far beyond his own knowledge he only plunged deeper yol n k and deeper in the forest he avoided however with remarkable boldness and sagacity the frequent dangers from snakes and wild animals took vestige under a talipottree from a storm which sent the shrieking flormouse to the same friendlyshelter and at night remembering that the cingalese sometimes constructed their habitations for security on the branches of trees he climbed the tallest trunks that he could meet with to sleep what was the agony of the bereaved mother during that long and solitary night gatura had not returned and wholly unsuspicious of his treachery she imagined that some fatal accident had happened to him and to his charge messenger after messenger did she despatch in every direction colonel pemberton was recalled and every means taken that the most anxious affection could dictate to recover the missing child he meanwhile wandered on subsisting on wild fruits by day and sleeping in trees by night until he had nearly reached the boundaries of candy he too poor child was heartsick and homesick the high courage which he inherited from his father animated him at the approach of danger but at other moments footsore weary bruised by falls and torn by bushes this spirits flagged and his strength was exhausted one day as he was passing by some brushwood which half concealed the entrance to a low cavern a furious buffalo came bellowing up a </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> a track in the forest and pausing for an instant lowered his head to attack the child another moment and willy would have been gored by his horns or tossed into the air buta man rushed from the cavern and seizing the child with one arm with the other flung a piece of cloth part of his own garments over the head of the buffalo blind 2 ing him and entangling ms horns so that the boy and his preserver had time to retreat into the cave the entrance to which was too low to admit the enraged animal willy was saved and turning to thank the friend to whose boldness and address he owed his life he burst into tears of delight clapped his little hands together and shouted vinna dear yinna three days after this yinna bending in respectful salutation with his arms folded upon his bosom stood in the presence of the beautiful wife of the canadian king she listened to his little story and listened pityingly for she was a woman and a mother she promised with the grace of conscious power and nobly did she redeem her promise to redress all yinna s grievances whether as regarded the oil of cinnamon which she justly suspected gatura to have stolen or the lost pearl and with regard to that pearl of pearls the noble boy willy she made it her first business her first pleasure to send him home to his distracted parents laden with presents and accompanied by his brave preserver the faithful cingalese this love will undo us all shakspeare one of the shortest and dreariest days in january was drawing to a close snow had fallen some days previously and glared upon the roofs of the houses in the picturesque and irregular old tovn of belford eegis and lay mixed with ice and trodden into a sort of wintry dust upon the highway snow too was visibly hanging in the grey and gloomy sky waiting only for milder weather for the hour when the soft southwest should steal upon the black northeast to come down in a world of white feathery flakes and cover the earth with its bright level uniform beauty the streets although not yet lighted were almost deserted of carriages and passengers except indeed the wellwrapt little boys and girls tripping rapidly home from school with cheeks almost as red as their red comforters and the noisier and merrier troop of happy illclad urchins who came frisking and shouting from the pond at the top of the hill the great pond opposite the queens head where they had been keeping the cold at bay by sliding and tumbling upon the ice and pelting each other with snowballs making as it were a playmate of the frost and excepting also careful servantmaids wending with cautious speed over the slippery pavement laden with smoking dishes from the bakehouses or hurrying potboys or slower milkmen rattling their jingling commodities against the icy steps of the doors or the iron railing of the areas in a word it was at the close of a winers day that the morning influx of customers having intermitted the shorten and apprentices of mr morris the greatest haberdasher of belford had retired to warm their fingers in their own apartment i preferring the bright e of the open grate to the smoky heat of the stove after returning to their shelves nicely folded up the numerous articles taken down to gratify the fastidiousness or the caprice of ladypurchasers for men to do them justice seldom do give this sort of trouble leaving in the dusky range of showrooms rendered tenfold more gloomy by the waving draperies which darkened the windows and swayed to and fro in the dim twilight only two individuals a respectablelooking elderly man who mounted upon a high stool was seated at a very businesslooking railedin desk employed in writing by the light of a single taper in an equally businesslike tall thick book bound in calfskin and a young man particularly welllooking and gentlemanly whose likeness to the former sufficiently marked their relationship and who stood at his side pretending to be occupied in arranging a drawer of rich satin ribbons which he was rolling and unrolling and doing unconsciously his very best to spoil in the eagerness of his appeal to his fathers feelings yes sir it is but too true and a thousand times she has urged the fact upon me that poor elizabeth is only a servant maid in the family of our good rector mr sumner a servant she certainly is but a most honoured and trusted one mrs sumner was so struck by her intelligence and sweetness above a dozen years ago amongst the girls at the green school that she took her home to her own house partly to attend and partly to play with her elder children she shared their advantages of education not indeed the accomplishments which were unfitted for her station but those better and rarer advantages which regard the cultivation of the mind and the formation of the character and mr sumners opinion of her has been sufficiently proved by his having since the death of his excellent wife and the marriage of his eldest daughter committed the direction of his house and of his two younger children unreservedly to her charge a servant she is but one accustomed to the management of a large family to the keeping of the most exact and elaborate accounts to the prudent and careful expenditure of money to everything in short that is most desirable in a tradesmans wife i speak now merely ina worldly point of view and say nothing of the beauty the sweetness the grace and the modesty which makes her an object of admiration wherever she appears she has no money replied mr morris suspending for a moment his pen over the book in which he had been apparently most sedulously engaged in making various entries during his sons harangue she has no money then her taste and skill in female apparel you know sii how often you have said that if my poor sisters had lived you would have added millinery and dressmaking to your business and converted some part of our large premises up stairs into showrooms how often i have heard you say that one branch of trade helped the other and that our opposite neighbour mr welsh would not be able to keep his shop open against us if it were not for his wifes caps and bonnets iow elizabeths taste and mr sumners connexion she has no money edward she has no money neither had she sir two years ago when in consequence of master arthurs rashly venturing upon ice too weak to bear his weight i had the first happiness of being of use to her and her young charge mine is no love of yesterday no concealed or clandestine attachment we have met openly at the institution lectures have walked together on summer evenings mr sumner without any verbal recognition of our engagement has yet often after church on a sunday virtually sanctioned it by smiling and significant invitations to accompany elizabeth and the children to his house nay even you yourself by your maimer of speaking to her and of her have led me to believe that you considered her as a daughter you are too keen an observer too kind and careful a father not to have seen the state of my affections and i had thought you too wise and too liberal to set a little paltry money in competition with the happiness of a whole life or to wish me to break my plighted troth to one whom i dearly love to one who loves me and marry i know not whom for the sake of adding needless pelf to our already flourishing fortunes i had thought your only son was dearer to you than money but i was mistaken you hold my honour and my happiness at no higher price than this gaud and he threw from him in bitterness of spirit the roll of ribbon which he had been so busily folding and unfolding the pen dropped from the fathers hand you are mistaken edward said hein a low voice which was interrupted fora moment by a sound well known to the inhabitants of belford the deep hoarse cry of shoes old shoes shoes old shoes from beneath the window you are mistaken my dear son not in my feelings but in my circumstances the fortunes of the poor halfstarved wretch who is calling shoes through the wintry snow are more flourishing than mine without your aid i am a bankrupt another hoarse deep cry of shoes old shoes shoes to buy shoes to sell shoes old shoes gave to the agitated father the pause which his feelings required his son was too much absorbed in astonishment and horror </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> horror for speech he could only listen in silent agony to a story which seemed to him rather like a frightful dream than a stem and waking reality mr morris continued you were too young when your blessed mother died to remember her distinctly and her poor sisters gentle and amiable as they were inherited rather her delicacy of constitution than her vigour of mind far above me in birth in education and in cultivation she was left destitute at the age of seventeen by the improvidence and the sudden death of her father a beneficed clergyman and i owed the blessing of her hand chiefly to her desire to procure for her twin brother a home and a protector before our marriage she made me promise to treat william arno as my own younger brother as my own eldest son to be to him as a friend a guardian a father and of this most solemn promise she requested the renewal upon her deathbed heaven and you my son pardon me if i have kept it but too faithfully let me make short work of this wretched matter i placed him as clerk in a banking house in the city where as you know he rose to be cashier i and another friend of my family i were his securities and all seemed fair and j prosperous three months ago he came to me in an agony of guilt and despair i he had been speculating in the share j i market he had embezzled a large sum belonging to the firm and unless it were replaced by a certain day his liberty his character his life for never he swore would he survive the loss of reputation were destroyed could i hesitate even had i abandoned him to his fate i was equally ruined since the house would have come upon me and upon the mend who at my pressing instance had joined me as his bondsman to indemnify them for their j loss the sum was to a man in my station enormous exceeding by some thousands the earnings and savings of the fiveandtwenty years that i have passed in business the deficiency was however raised for me within the stipulated time by our friendly solicitor mr byrne who happened to have at the moment a client willing to lend the money upon my personal security and this house with the stock and furniture i gave him a bill of sale on all my effects and was considering whether or not to break the matter to you or to go on upon credit and leave the result to time when mr byrne made me two days ago a most unexpected overture from the friends of a yoimg person with a portion of l000 who although informed of my difficulties was yet willing to marry her to you willing to pay off the debt requiring nothing but a settlement of the rest of the money and such an arrangement as to partnership as i should have been inter any circumstances but too happy to enter into i have not seen her i do not even know her name but she is they tell me young welleducated and vol ii l amiable a thoroughly good and exemplary girl oh my father do with me as you like but yet elizabeth dear dear elizabeth you would rather then be poor and happy with her whom you love so be it my dear son go to your elizabeth see if she be willing to share your poverty willing to wait until some prospect may arise that should in some sort authorize your union the unhappy man whose imprudence has been our ruin spoke of one whose defalcation had ruined him and who might who probably would hereafter make good the sums for which he was engaged he has repeated this expectation in a letter which i received from him last week but that hope is too vague to build upon see elizabeth disclose to her unreservedly the position of affairs i feel that with her the confidence will be sacred and then act as you see good put me out of the question i am still strong and healthy and capable of earning my bread as a shopmans father never never interrupted edward with a sharp and sudden revulsion of feeling even if i vere so undutiful so unnatural she would not consent i know she would not often and often has she said that she felt that our marriage would never take place that it never ought to take place that your son the son of the most respectable tradesman in belford ought not to be united to a poor girl from a charity school and now that that union can only be accomplished by depriving you of your home by sending you in your old ago to serve as a hireling oh she would never hear of it would never bear the thought go to elizabeth repeated mr morris l 2 in a smothered voice pressing his sons hands between his with an energy that betokened the struggle of his feelings go and consult with your elizabeth and as the shorten and apprentices came flocking in and the lighted gas gave a glittering brilliancy to the rich and gaily decorated shop radiant with shawls and silks and ribbons of a hundred varied hues and a group of customers gay country ladies who wished to choose an evening dress by candlelight appeared at the door he escaped into the street with an instinctive desire for solitude and almost unconsciously took the road to st michaels rectory the lamps in the streets and shops were now burning and showed with a most striking effect of light and shadow the fantastic outline of the picturesque old town the tops of the houses covered with snow the icicles hanging from the eaves and the windows already covered with icy frostwork the pavement was again alive with passengers men and women hurrying to the postoffice flies and carriages gliding with a sort of dull rumbling sound along the snowy road a stagecoach emptying itself of its freezing passengers at the eed lion a man with periwinkles and a woman with hot chesnuts each so muffled the man in a frieze cloak and the woman in a dreadnought coat that it would have puzzled an oedipus to decide betwixt the he and the she one little girl lingering longingly in the wake of the periwinkles two great boys burning their fingers in a bold attempt to filch the burning chesnuts other children rushing aimlessly along shouting and bellowing as if to scare the cold men were thumping their feet upon the ground and buffeting their chest with their arms to restore the circulation women were chattering dogs barking beggars begging fiddles scraping bells ringing knockers tattattating sin short all the noises of a win ry evening in a country town were in full activity from the high bridge where the broad bright river with its double line of wharfs and houses crowded with people its boats and its barges forms so gay and pretty a moving picture so full of bustle and colour of light and of life from the high bridge the bennett now showed like a mirror reflecting on its icy surface with a peculiar broad and bluish shine the arch of lamps surmounting the graceful airy bridge and the twinkling lights that glanced here and there from boat or barge or wharf or from some uncurtained window that overhung the river the snow lay in drifts upon either shore marking the long perspective and glanced upon the suburban cottages and the distant country edging into the gentle uplands hardly deserving the name of hills that closed the prospect strongly relieved at the present moment by the dark and dusky sky in spite of his distress and preoccupied mi ad poor edward who had probably without knowing it much of those two rare gifts the poets feeling and the painters eye could not help stopping a moment on the centre of the bridge to contemplate so fine an effect of chiaroscuro 60 striking and beautiful a picture composed almost without colour by the nice contrast of light and shade while he stood admiring the scene he was overtaken by the old man whom he had heard a short while previously crying shoes shoes under the window of his fathers shop and whom he had passed just before whilst engaged in chaffering for some of his commodities with an orangewoman whose barrow was stationed at the end of the bridge the itinerant shoemerchant was as i have said wellknown to the inhabitants of belford by the name of old isaac and from his name his calling his keenness at a bargain as well as from his quick black eye aquiline nose and a greater proportion of beard than is usually suffered in this </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> this good kingdom of england to adorn a christian countenance was com only reputed to be a jew he was a spare old man of the middle height somewhat stooping but with a picturesque and richly coloured head surmounted by an old slouched hat his patched and faded garments were wellnigh hidden by two enormous bags in which he carried the old shoes which he bought and the new ones or soidisantiiew for he was a greatman at a rifacimentoy and had the art to gar auld shoon look mast as guide s the new which he sold buy a pair of warm slippers master i this cold night quoth isaac wedding slippers fine enough for a lord nothing this evening said edward have em a bargain master persisted the man of shoes i am not in want of any rejoined edward moving on wedding shoes then wedding boots must buy somewhat continued the vender pertinaciously keeping up with our friends rapid steps and thrusting before his eyes the articles which he named i tell you that i want neither wedding slippers nor wedding shoes nor any of your commodities answered edward with some humour endeavouring to escape from his pursuer dont ye exclaimed isaac with a knowing twinkle of his keen black eye dont ye well then buy for the want thats to come ive set my heart upon having a bit of a deal with ye tonight and shant mind bating a penny or two rather than balk my fancy you shall have em under prime cost continued isaac coaxingly you shall have em for next to nothing do ye have em we must have a deal youll see that youll be married sooner than you think for your times coming so you may as well buy the wedding slippers at once what do you bid for em make an offer not a farthing jew i am in haste you need not untie the bag you have nothing that i would take if you would give it me let me pass on i am not going to be married i want nothing of you dont be too sure of that master edward morris you and i may come to a deal yet jew quotha no more a jew than yourself if your eyes were not turned another way you might see me in the aisle of st michaels church every sunday morning and afternoon as regular as yourself jew tis an extraordinary compliment you idle folk pay to that tramping race that whenever you meet a body who takes care of the main chance and turns an honest penny you call him a jew well master edward youll see that youll come to me for your wedding slippers and so saying isaac shouldered his bag again and left the path free at another moment edward would have smiled at the old mans acute observation of the direction of his glances in church and at his persevering endeavour to attract a customer founded upon that observation but his thoughts were too painfully divided between his father and his mistress his duty and his love and during his rapid walk to st michaels rectory he could only resolve to be guided in all things by the judgment and the feeling of elizabeth 156 wedding slippers she received her lover with the gentle j selfpossession the calm and serious sweet ness which characterised her maimer and which had been partly perhaps the cause partly the result of the confidence placed in her by mr sumner his father had to suit his purpose forced himself to ad vert to her situation and her origin in his conversation with his son but edward felt proudly that there was no trace of the charity school or of the servants hall in the lovely woman who stood before him with a simple and unaffected propriety in a higher rank it would have been termed dignity that would have beseemed a palace his distress was immediately visible to her and her anxious inquiries j served to introduce his story we must part edward as to that there can be neither doubt nor question said she in a low steady voice whilst the tears trembled on the long fringes of her large black eyes and the rich colour went f and came on the finelyturned cheeks and lips which a sculptor would have been proud to model we must part i have always known that it would be so always felt without suspecting or dreaming of this obstacle that mr morris would find an insuperable objection to receiving me into his family i ought perhaps knowing that to have forbidden your visits but i was encouraged in my attachment by one whom i am bound to obey and by whose orders i have acted in this business and my own feelings led me but too readily into the error oh if it were only for ourselves this poverty would be nothing young active accustomed to exertion it would be delightful to labour with you and for you delightful to feel that there was no superiority on your side except that of your respectable connexions and your manly and vigorous character but your father your kind and excellent father to tear him from his home to send him in his old age to serve as an hireling he so long accustomed to respect and consideration to banish him from his friends his neighbours his native town we must not think of it the sacrifice must be made and you will find your happiness dear edward we shall find our happiness in his restored comfort and in the consciousness of having done our duty affectionate son as edward was and determined as he had professed himself to abide by the decision of his mistress he could not refrain from combating this resolution she listened to him with sweet and mournful attention as if willing to hear all that he had to say but her determination was unshaken she had just asked since we must part dearest edward were it not wiser to shorten this pain when an oddlooking little note was delivered to her elizabeth read the contents once twice thrice and remained silent and perplexed j as if hardly comprehending the meaning it is very strange exclaimed she thinking aloud and forgetting that she was not alone very strange what can he want at this hour he exclaimed edward jealous so strange a thing is a lovers heart of hex whom he was upon the very point of resigning he what he from whom comes that note from one who must be apprised of this event not surely fiom mr sumner no from him it cannot be eut from whom who can have the power so to absorb your attention at such a moment elizabeth paused an instant and then said gently come with me and you shall know although we are doomed to part to meet no more you must always be amongst the most valued the most cherished of my friends i cannot afford to lose your good opinion come with me and you shall know all she tied on her bonnet wrapped herself in a large cloak and they passed through the rectory garden into the churchyard the fine old gothic building with its grey cloisters its graceful porch its towers and its steeple rose in sombre grandeur from the graveyard covered with snow by which it was surrounded the summit almost lost in the frosty mists of the air so that the imagination added to the actual height gave a cathedrallike grandeur to the edifice a few yews and cypresses were clustered in one corner and a row of stately limes their larger limbs partially covered with snow which lay in long intersecting lines defining the forms of the branches led to an iron gate which opened into a narrow lane leading to one of the poorest and least populous suburbs of the tovnti along this lane elizabeth passed sedulously attended by edward i ought to have told you before said she in a low voice only he whom it most concerns forbade the disclosure and mr sumner i hardly know why coincided in his desire that although a charity girl i am not as you have thought an orphan i have a father a most fond and affectionate father one whom i love dearly and who dearly loves me he is a poor but industrious man following a mean occupation not so poor but that he makes me frequent presents and is most kind and generous to the widow in whose cottage he lives and whom he mainly supports still i have always felt that he was not fit to be your father nor to be connected so closely with a man so intelligent so welleducated and so respectable in station as vol ii m mr moms i always felt that something </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> something would prevent our union and so alas it has turned out by this time the clouds had so far cleared away as to admit glimpses of a keen and frosty moon which shed a cold pale desolate light upon every object dwelling with tenfold desolation on a small hovel whose lagged thatch and windows stuffed with ra2s as well as the brokendown state of the little gate ajar perforce since hanging by one hinge it would neither shut nor open which led into the narrow front court betokened the most sordid poverty up this court elizabeth passed and knocking with as it seemed a forced resolution at a low door in little better condition than the gate which formed the outer barricade was immediately admitted by an infirm old woman into a dark and dismal kitchen i look for your father every minute miss betsy quoth the tottering crone for tis past his time o coining in and if yell wait till i strike a light ye may walk into his room and ill kindle ve a bit o fire for you tender lasses that live in grand houses cant bear the cold like us poor folk that be used to nothing better and so saying she fumbled out an old tinderbox and having with some difficulty cherished a spark into a flame for her old and withered hand and feeble breath seemed numbed and chilled by the cold which she defied so manfully she lighted a wretched candle led the way into the next apartment and endeavoured with a little damp straw and a few dirty chips that had evidently been long trodden under foot in some carpenters yard to produce in a small rusty grate from which the brickwork was breaking away something as nearly approaching to m 2 a blaze as the state of the fireplace and the nature of the fuel would allow edward in the meanwhile took a mournful survey of the sordid abode contrasting so strongly with the appearance the mind and the manners of the lovely and graceful woman who stood beside him the beloved of his heart the hearth and its appointments the bit of old iron that served as a poker the broken dustpan that officiated as shovel the pipkin upon two legs and the lipless pint cup which did duty as kettle pot and saucepan this niggard and beggarly hearth was but a type of the rugged and scanty perishing of the comfortless chamber a joint stool a rickety table and two tumbledown chairs one of them garnished with a cushion darned patched and mended until mending was no longer possible figured in the centre of the uneven bricked floor over the chimney was a mug without a handle a teapot curtailed of its fair proportions by the loss of half a spout a teacup and saucer of different patterns and two or three plates and basins all more or less cracked and repaired not very artistically with putty and white paint in one corner was the inmates humble bed a chaff mattress with one or two rugs or horsecloths much the worse for wear in another the little pile of straw and chips and rotten sticks from whence the fuel now smoking rather than burning in the chimney had been selected and in a third a dingy heap of old shoes the old woman satisfied with her labour retired to her part of the dwelling elizabeth was the first to break the pause which succeeded her departure this edward is the abode of my father of a father whom in spite of all that surrounds us i have good cause to love does not the sight of such misery serve to reconcile you to the destiny that parts ns such at least is the effect which it ought to have which it has on me i am not fit to belong to your family never should i have cherished such a thought strange that mr sumner knowing as he did the whole truth should have encouraged our attachment strange most strange that till now the name and the existence of my father should have remained a secret well my presumption is fitly punished and you will turn with a freer heart to one more worthy to share your home and possess your affections say not so my own elizabeth were it not for my paramount duty to my own most kind and excellent father all that i see here would but supply a fresh motive for our union all speaks of poverty and industry nothing of crime and next to the joy of offering you a comfortable home should i reckon that of rescuing one so near and dear to you from penury and toil oh that i were now the free agent that i thought myself yesterday not another night should your father spend beneath this roof if my wretched uncle arnott could but know the misery that his wild spirit of speculation has brought upon us all if he could master edward i am minded that hed rather cry old shoes than gamble in the share market quoth our friend isaac advancing into the room depositing with considerable care his two bags of shoes in their appropriate corner and emptying with equal readiness divers rotten sticks fir apples and stumps of gorse gathered during his days travel for apparently he had wended countryman from the several pockets of his nondescript garments if these stockexchange gamblers could but tell the sore hearts they cause to their friends and kindred mayhap it might go nigh to reform em pursued isaac so here you be master edward come to make a deal as i prophesied and ye ha brought bess wi ye to clinch the bargain so much the better gie me a kiss bess so thou best come to help master edward to choose his wedding slippers eh my girl and the old man nodded his head with a knowing wink and chuckled come to choose the wedding slippers alas my dear father you little know began elizabeth alack and alack wench no blacks for me i do know all the story ay and a great deal besides that neither of you know wise as ye think yourselves come my good boy and girl sit ye down here by the fire bess looks as white as the snow on the housetop and thou master edward art not much better sit down and make yourselves comfortable ill tell you au about it and the old shoemerchant drew his two chairs to either side of his little fire seated himself upon a stool in the middle flung on fresh fuel breaking the sticks with his withered hands and did the honours of his small apartment with much hospitality well master morris for all i cry old shoes about the streets and my bess heaven bless her sweet face was brought up at a charity school it aint altogether for want of a bit of money many a year have i been scraping and scraping and hoarding and hoarding to save her a portion and i told her and mr sumner not to let out that she had a father just for the pleasure of the surprise like so in the meantime comes this affair of master arnott ay better cry old shoes than go gambling in shares so i happened to have the money waiting for a good security nothing like turning an honest penny just when master byrne was wanting it for your father so i lets him have it heres the paper see whatdyeeallt the bill of sale and i offered him my girl with 15000 to her portion not letting out who she was and here ive just got a letter from him to master byrne saying as how twill break your heart to marry her not thinking mind that shes she and i repose as how

heard today from a real jew who knows a good deal of what goes on on change that master arnott is likely to get his money back again so now off wi ye to master morris and tell him the news </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> news and harkye my boy dont forget to come back for the wedding slippers it is a poison tempered by himself shakspeare nay i know that the stormy petrel is as pretty a boat and manned by as stout a crew as ever sailed among the green islands of the carib sea or coasted j the bays and headlands of the main but i a mans heart is made of flesh senor captain albeit it sail under the black flag and even your wild sea rovers may i not be able to resist the smooth tongue of this varlet it is a soft spoken youth i tell thee give him three inches of cold steel as soon as he boards thee and fling him off into the waves the deep sea tells no tales as thou wilt returned the buccaneer with a slight curl of his thin lip and a glance from whose strange mixture of gaiety and scorn the haughty spaniard involuntarily shrunk as thou wilt i had destined his ghost to the honour of guarding my own private hoard buried in the sand on an island that shall be nameless eut tis easy to carry off some captive for that purpose for he must be slain on the spot observe to be ready for the performance of his duty and now so far as looks might go the planters scornful sneer for he understood rightly that however glossed over by levity the superstition was a real feeling retorted the illdissembled contempt of the pirate captain since thou mistnistest the tender mercy of my daredevils black juan of cales with his stiletto or the bohemian giant brandt with his boar spear shall put him out of pain or ever he sets foot on the deck of the stormy petrel the stab shall come before the fear but how are we to make prize of him senor don pedro thou wouldst not have me send a boats crew to carry him off bodily from thine own plantation i see that the little boat is still at the cove by the creek canst thou not deliver him thyself into our hands not for all the silver of mexico donna gonsalva already misdoubt that i love not her favourite page she knows too no good grease continued don pedro checking himself i must not be seen in this matter i must despatch antonio to the petrel in the little boat an hour or two before sunset whilst i myself remain at san isidro and in full sight of my whole household he will come alone contrive to return the boat to its moorings and hark ye thou hast flags of all nations hoist the red cross of st george at the masthead as soon as the deed be done he will come alone and without token there is thy warrant added the spaniard taking a heavy purse from his girdle and tossing it to the pirate there is thy warrant and now the sooner we put land and sea between us the safer for both coward thought the bold sea rover as each turned to pursue his separate way insolent coward the red cross of st george the ensign of england to announce a deed like this the craven is liberal however muttered he to himself poising the purse of doubloons after a moments pause fear is a special paymaster well his job shall be done my trusty mate miles bertrand shall manage it whilst i row stealthily to my own little desert island and add this gold to my secret hoard miles knows no spanish so that pleading and remonstrance will stead the poor wretch naught and in good sooth that rugged mate of ours will have no more remorse in striking down the solitary boatman than i have in crushing this beetle tis a foul deed after all but yon craven spaniard must answer it thus mused the captain of the stormy petrel as he strode with hasty steps towards the shore the halfexpressed thoughts of his late companion as he bent his way inland were not a jot more flattering ruffian so ran his soliloquy scoffing mercenary ruffian and artful as mercenary for had i consented to accompany antonio who shall say how the visit might have ended and yet continued he more calmly of such tools doth a wise man make the instruments that shape his fortunes to be fairly rid of this young antonio now too that if i read her rightly gonsalva hath discovered all and now that the speedy arrival of the governor at vera cruz will take my fairest cousin from my ward robbing me at one stroke of beauty and of wealth of living and of love why it is such a necessity that if the pirate had demanded a statue of pure gold to guard his island treasure the robber must have had it well i have only now to find senor antonio despatch him on some feigned errand to the petrel and be careful to keep in view of the whole household until vespers be past i marvel if the masts of the schooner be visible from the portico of san isidro or whether i must ascend the roof vol ii n the red cross flag will glitter afar i must make good speed to find antonio and quickening his pace he hastened silently towards the plantation the spot where these two worthies had held discourse of life and death deliberately plotting the murder of an unoffending and innocent fellowcreature was one of the most beautiful on the beautiful shores of spanish america a clear and sparkling rivulet gushed from the foot of a tall rock overhung by the luxuriant and splendid creepers of the tropics a grove of feathery palms yielded their long foliage to the sway of the western gale mingling their murmur with the pleasant sound of running waters and adding by their delicious shade to the perpetual freshness and verdure of the grassy margin of the spring flowers of every hue hung from the grey crag and the lofty palm trees or enamelled the turfs ground whilst birds and insects gorgeous as flowers flitted from blossom to blossom or basked in the fervid beams of noon how could evil thoughts and evil deeds spring into life in such a scene a few hours had passed away since the interview which i have attempted to describe and now the evening sun shone upon herb and flower and flowering tree illumining with a diamondlike radiance the clear waters of the fountain and bathing in a flood of light the lovely creature who stood upon its brink she was gazing upon a miniature which she held in her hand gazing so intently that she started to hear her own name although the speaker in following her thither did but obey her mandate donna gonsalva said the page antonio responded his fair mistress antonio are we alone art thou sure that we are alone that none can see or n 2 hear us above all that my stem and haughty cousin my servant as he calls himself my master for so i have long felt him to be is at safe distance dangerous were it past all danger if he should hear that which i have to tell where is don pedro antonio i left him whiting even now at the house dear lady he hath sent me on an errand to the trader in the roadstead to bring from the vessel certain rich stujqfe which he would he said have rowed ashore himself had he not been engaged preparing letters for madrid he enjoined me to use despatch and i should be already in a little boat had not nez conveyed to me your command to meet you here you tremble dearest lady your colour comes and goes is their aught in which the poor antonio can stead his sweet mistress hath any man dared to grieve you say dear antonio this emotion springs from joy not grief i weep i know not why dost thou recognize this picture full surely it is the portrait of my honoured lord your noble father and dost thou remember children as we were how he sent for us to stand beside his dying bed and kissed and blessed us and bade us love each other oh thou dost thou dost i see thou dost none knew thy parentage thou wast called an orphan a poor orphan and don pedro when he took possession of this rich plantation of san isidro calling himself my guardian and claiming me as his destined bride would fain have sent thee to a monastery to college to the army anywhere away from me but our childish love was proof against threat or artifice we would not be parted and you remained at san isidro as my page mine own dear and loving page oh antonio our love </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> love was an instinct prepare for a strange happiness looking today at this portrait given to me on his deathbed by my father i touched a spring the back flew open and discovered a letter prepare thyself for happiness incredible for joy past all joy my antonio that letter thou knowst that my mother died in the hour that i was born that letter told of a secret marriage during a brief sojourn immediately after her death in the country of his ancestors a marriage to one of humbler fortunes the daughter of a soldier of old spain she too gave birth to a child and shortly after died antonio dear antonio canst thou not guess the rest thou art that child my brother dear antonio 1 the rightful heir of san isidro my brother oh what joy is in the name 1 mine own dear brother wilt thou not speak tome antonio gonsalva sweetest sister v and the happy brother and sister were locked in each others arms we must be cautious for a short space dear brother i said gonsalva raising herself at length from antonios tearful embrace we must be cautious awhile or our grasping kinsman who as our fathers heir male and as my guardian and destined husband has hitherto enjoyed the revenues of this princely estate would scruple no artifice to retain it i tremble lest my emotion at the discovery may have awakened his suspicions our calmness must quiet them we shall not long need to dissimulate our powerful kinsman the conte almeida is already on his way to vera cruz we will put these letters into his hands the moment of his arrival his authority as governor will be absolute there will be no difficulty in proving the marriage father ignatius of the dominicans of seville performed the ceremony i tell thee antonio thou shalt be recognized as heir of san isidro as mine own dear brother how proud i am of the name and now away with thee we must not awaken suspicion till tomorrow farewell farewell then sweetest sister sweetest and most beloved what grief it is to leave thee even for one night most beloved and most generous gonsalva generous say selfish dear antonio wilt thou not save me from a hated marriage am i not rich in a thricedear brother generous indeed but this is no time for chiding thou must away hasten to perform thine errand delay no longer and they parted the fair gonsalva full of a generous and overflowing contentment took the shortest path towards the plantation while antonio scarcely recovered from the bewildering joy and astonishment of her communications obeyed half mechanically the wave of the hand by which she had indicated that his way led to the seashore the sudden and impressive sense of happiness so perfect and so exquisite seemed like some enchanting dream too bright to last that he the poor and homeless orphan the child of charity with no friend save his dear lady should be the son of honourable parents the brother of that sweet and gracious creature privileged to love and protect her to forestall her every wish to make for her such sacrifices as she had joyfully made for him to prove himself worthy of the blood of which he sprung worthy to wield the knightly sword of his fathers such thoughts swelled his heart almost to bursting he longed to pour out his whole soul in prayer and thanksgiving and suddenly pausing as he wound among the rocks he saw just above him a stone cross shining brightly in the last rays of the setting sun and struck into an upward path which led to a small chapel on the top of the cliff built and endowed by his father don rodrigo hernandez partly ingratitude to the virgin for an escape from shipwreck and partly to serve as a beacon on that dangerous coast beneath was the shallow cavern in which don pedros boat lay moored and so close as to be within hail fiom the shore was the stormy petrel the pirate vessel prostrate before the shrine of the virgin mother absorbed in prayer and pious meditation antonio found the spiritcalm which he wanted time had passed by unnoted and he was roused from his devotions by a rapid step below iso signal muttered don pedro ashe loosened the boat from its moorings no redcross flag he must have reached the schooner long ago hath the pirate villain played me false shall i hail him no ill row to the ship and learn the truth at once by the time antonio had descended the steep and rugged pathway that led from the chapel to the shore don pedro putting his whole strength to the oars had reached the vessel apparently he was expected there the stormy petrel lay defined in strong relief against the bright but transient glow of a tropical sunset two figures stood at the gangway and as the spaniard mounted the ships side a boar spear and a stiletto entered his body the horrorstricken page saw the steel gleam and heard the heavy plunge as the corpse dropped into the reddening wave the murderer had fallen by his own engine this even handed justice commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice to our own lips note the leading incident of schillers beautiful ballad of fridolin a good deal altered will be recognised in this story ah those great poets who lived before us they stole all our best ideas k heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid some banished lover pope tap went a modest timid shysounding knock against the oldfashioned oaken door of william marshalls domicile in the brief twilight of a september evening the hour of all others in which a prettyyoung woman might with the least risk of observation pay a visit to a handsome bachelor the best hour to shield her from the attacks of village gossip or to cover her own confusion should her errand be such as to challenge something like a jest on the part of her host tap tap again went the slender forefinger but although the reiterated summons was a thought louder than the first nearly inaudible demand for admittance it was equally unsuccessful in arousing the attention of the master of the dwelling eor this abstraction there was a reason which the young and tenderhearted will admit to be valid the poor youth was in love and to enhance that calamity he had quarrelled with the mistress of his affections william marshall at the time of which i write schoolmaster of aberleigh the only son of one of the poorest widows in the parish was a person of great merit some quickness and much industry had given him a degree of information and refinement unusual in his station and his excellent conduct and character had secured the friends whom his talents had attracted in short he was one of those instances more frequent than the grumblers of the world are willing to admit which prove that even in this life desert is pretty certain to meet its reward the ancient pedagogue of the village a man of some learning who availed himself of the large and airy schoolhouse to add boarders aspiring to the accomplishments of mathematics and the classics to the sturdy country lads whom by the will of the founder he was bound to instruct in reading and writing declared that this his darling scholar caught up untaught and unfledged all that he painfully endeavoured to instil by book and birch into the fortunate pupils whose fathers were rich enough to pay for teaching and whipping and he followed up this declaration not only by installing him at the early age of seventeen into the post of his assistant but by recommending him so warmly to the trustees as his successor that at his death which occurred about six years after william marshall in spite of his youth was unanimously elected to fill the place of his old master and took possession of the pretty house upon school green with its two noble elms in front as well as of the large garden orchard and meadow which the brook after crossing the green and being in turn crossed by the road and the old ivied bridge went cranking round so merrily clear bright and rapid as ever rolled rivulet now this besides its pleasantness as a residence formed a position which considering the difference of the age and times might be reckoned for our modest scholar full as good as the magnificent proffer of the green gown cows grass and four marks ayear made by the good abbot boniface to albert glendinning and by the said albert glendinning to the unspeakable astonishment and scandal of the assistants unceremoniously rejected since in addition to the stipend paid regularly as quarterday came round and the prospect of as many boarders as </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> as the house would hold was the probable contingency of the taxgathering and rate collecting the timbervaluing and landmeasuring which usually fall to the share of the schoolmaster together with the reversion of the office of parishclerk provided always that for a master of scholars f who taught latin and greek and took boarders such office were not held infra dig william marshalls humble wishes were vide the monastery f a scholar sir i was a master of scholars lingo in the disagreeable surprise gratified he was a happy man for in addition to the comfort of having a respectable home for the infirm mother to whom he had always been a most exemplary son he had the gratification so at least said the gossips of aberleigh of preparing a suitable abode for one of the best and prettiest of the village maidens ever since the days of pyramus and thisbe proximity has been known for the friend of love and such was probably the case in the present instance since lucy wilmot the object of william marshalls passion was his next neighbour the brook of which we have made honourable mention being the sole barrier by which her fathers meadows were divided from the garden and orchard of the school a more beautiful boundary was never seen than that clear babbling stream which went wandering in and out at its own sweet will with such infinite variety vol ii o i of margin now fringed with alders now tufted with hawthorn and hazel now rising into a steep bank crowned with a giant oak flinging its broad arms across the waters the reflection of its rich indented foliage broken by the frequent dropping of a smooth acorn from its dimpled cup now sloping gently down into a verdant bay enamelled with flowers of all hues the intensely blue forgetmenot half hidden under the light yellow clusters of the crossleaved bedstraw while the purple spikes of the willowherb waved amidst the golden chalices of the loosestrife and large patches of the feathery meadowsweet the heliotrope of the fields spread its almondlike fragrance and its pale and feathery beauty to the very centre of the stream overhanging the snowy blossoms of the waterlily as they rose from their deep green leaves and mingling with that most remarkable of the many sedges that border our english rivers whose flowers placed so regularly on either side of their tall stalks resemble balls of ebony thickly set with ivory spikes certainly of all possible methods of dividing or uniting persons and property this bright and cheerful stream seemed the most propitious to social intercourse as william and lucy found by experience the green in front of the schoolhouse formed a commodious natural playground for the children sufficiently near for safety and yet wide enough for all their sports the noble game of cricket included so that those sharp little eyes which love so dearly to pry into the weaknesses of their elders especially when those elders assume the double relation of ruler and preceptor were during the intervals of tuition happily engaged elsewhere and really nobody except perhaps a lover would believe how attentive william marshall became to the cow which was tethered in the orchard how punctual in culling himself all the fruit and vegetables needed from the garden how assiduous above all in watering his mothers little flowerpot sloping down to the stream whilst on her part it was at least equally remarkable how often lucy wilmot found cause to fill her pail at the brook or to feed the ducks geese chickens and turkeys which she had dislodged from their old home the farmyard to establish by the water side never was poultry so zealously looked after it happened to be a dry summer and it stands upon record at the brook farm that lucy volunteered to fetch all the water wanted for domestic use by the whole family to be sure as her sisters would laughingly observe they had sometimes to wait for it especially if it were towards dinnertime or before breakfast or after school broke up and then lucy would blush and declare that she would never go near the place again and then by way of keeping her word she would take up her little basket of barley and run across the meadow to feed her chickens halcyon days were these what a charming spot for a rural flirtation was that mirrorlike stream what tender words floated across it what smiles and blushes looked brightly down into the bright waters and of how many of the small gifts the graceful homages in which love delights was that clear brook the witness from the earliest violet to the latest rose from the first blushing cherry to the katherine pear rich and ruddy as lucys own round healthful cheek not an offering escaped the assiduity of the devoted lover halcyon days were these to our friend william when an affliction befel him in the very scene of his happiness a shadow fell across the sunshine of his love so hideous and gloomy as to darken his whole future prospects to sadden and embitter his very life like many other swiffc and sudden poisons nothing could be more innocent in appearance than this implement of mischief which wore the quiet and unoffending form of an unopened letter hovering one day by the side of the stream waiting with a basket of filberts brown as the squirrel whose teeth crack them as fletcher has it filberts firm juicy and fragrant the first of season awaiting until the close of evening should bring his lucy to tend her poultry under the great oak she saw a letter on the grass and springing from bank to bank on a spot a little higher up where the brook was sufficiently narrow to admit of this sort of lovers leap he stooped for the paper suspecting sooth to say that it might be some billetdoux of his own with the design of returning it to the fair owner his it was not on the contrary the epistle was sealed with a pretty device of doves drinking from the same shallow bowl an imitation of the exquisite doves of the vatican which he himself had given to lucy his first pledge of love and directed in her wellknown hand to mr willatts at the eed boot bristol street belford well did william marshall know this mr willatts well did he know and heartily did he despise this dandy of the eed boot who slim civil and simpering all rings and chains smirks and grimaces curls and essences skipped about in his secondhand coxcombry as if the vending of earthly boots and shoes were too gross for so ethereal a personage and glassslipper maker to cinderella were his fitting designation william always had disliked him in virtue of the strong antipathy which opposite holds to opposite and now to see a letter to him directed by lucy this lucy sealed too with that seal but she would explain it of course she would she must she should explain what motive she could have for writing to such a creature as that after confessing her love for him after all had been arranged between her father and himself and everything was prepared for their marriage before the ensuing christmas he had a right to demand an explanation and ought not to be content with any thing short of the most ample and satisfactory account of the whole matter just as he had worked himself up to the very climax of angry suspicion his fair mistress with her eyes cast down upon the grass evidently in search of the lost letter advanced slowly towards the spot she started when she saw him and when he presented the epistle with a greeting in the true spirit of the above soliloquy in which a stern and peremptory demand for explanation was mingled with an ironical and contemptuous congratulation upon the correspondent whom she had chosen her answer between confusion at the discovery indignation at the j jealousy so openly avowed and astonishment at the high tone taken by one who had hitherto shown nothing but the gentlest tenderness displayed so much displeasure vexation and embarrassment that the dialogue grew rapidly into a quarrel and ended in a formal separation between the lovers each party returned home angry and grieved william most angry if we may judge from his sending the unlucky filberts basket and all floating down the stream lucy most grieved if the crumpled letter and defaced address so nearly washed out by her tears that it required all the skill and experience of the belford postmaster to decipher the legend j may be accepted as evidence in spite however of this token of her fond relenting the first tidings that i william marshall heard of lucy were that she had gone on a visit to her god i </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> i mother twenty miles off william on his part staid at home instructing his pupils i as well as he could in spite of lovers quarrels the work of the world goes on to be sure the poor boys wondered why their master usually so eventempered was so difficult to satisfy and his fond i mother could not comprehend why when she spoke to him her son always so mindful of his only remaining parent answered at cross purposes eut william although a lover was a strongminded man and before a week had elapsed he had discovered his own infirmity and had j determined to correct it accordingly he opened his desk took out the map of an estate which he had just finished measuring before the unlucky adventure of the hero of the eed boot and having compared his own mensuration of the different fields with the estimated extent and completed the necessary calculations had just relapsed into a reverie when the interruption occurred which formed the beginning of our little story tap tap tap sounded once again and this time a little impatiently tap tap tap ah my good cousin kate said william at last admitting the poor damsel who had waited this unmerciful while at the door of which detention our lover had one hardly knows how a glimmering consciousness i hope you have not been long detained why did not you knock louder do you want my mother no or you would not have come to the door of my little room you want me kate i see so tell me at once what i can do for you and smiling blushing and hesitating kate confessed that she did want her cousin william that she had a letter william started and winced at the very sound a letter to write and she was such a poor scholar and the friend who used to write her letters was away so she had come to trouble cousin william no trouble at all dear kate replied william recovering from this confusion and too much occupied with the recollections awakened by the very name of a letter to observe the embarrassment of his pretty visitor no trouble at all here is my paper ready iow begin is it to your brother in london oh no replied the blushing damsel not to my brother to a friend very well said william the days draw in so fast that it will soon be dark begin dear kate and after a little hesitation and playing with a folded letter that she held in her hand kate in a very low hesitating voice began to dictate dear francis dear frances echoed her amanuensis unsuspectingly in a still lower tone then pausing and looking up as expecting her to proceed stop said kate only that it is wrong to give you the trouble to begin again but that sounds so formal i think it does replied william dashing his pen rapidly through the words and the abbreviation is so pretty too there continued he dear fanny that sounds as well again fanny exclaimed kate half laughing in the midst of her blushes fanny indeed why cousin william and cousin william awaking immediately to the perception of the true state of the case dashed out the second beginning as rapidly as he had done the first and laughing with a very good grace at his own stupidity wrote this time in full assurance of being right dear frank fanny forsooth repeated kate still laughing well but kate remember that i had never heard of this friend of yours to be sure it was very very stupid but now shall we go on with the letter or may i ask who this frank fanny interposed kate archly swell who this francis is does my good aunt know dear kate or oh yes dear william mother knows and father knows and both like him so much tt has been kept a secret till now because his friends are so much better todo in the world than mine for he is a tradesman william going into partnerships with his late master they are so much richer and grander than father that we thought they might not like their eldest son to marry a poor working girl but he said they would only look to good character and so they say in this letter and they have consented and he told them how you my own cousin had got on by your own good conduct william and how proud he was of knowing you i know him then interrupted william with pleased curiosity yes to be sure dont you remember our all drinking tea together at farmer wilmots last sunday was three weeks lucy knew it all along < frank frank willatts inquired william eagerly was it for you then that lucy wrote that letter to be sure she did and were you 208 the village amanuensis j jealous of her william and was that j why she went away oh william william to be jealous of dear good lucy because she kept my secret oh cousin william but william was too happy to be very penitent and kate was too pleased and too busy to dilate upon his offences she had her letter to dictate and with a little help from her willing amanuensis a very pretty letter it was and so completely in charity with all the world especially with the franks of the world was this amanuensis that before he had finished j kates epistle he had written himself into such feelings of goodwill towards her correspondent as to add a most friendly and cousinly postscript on his own account what were the contents of the far more ardent and eloquent letter which william marshall afterwards wrote and whether he did or did not obtain his mistresss pardon for his jealousy and its fruits we leave to the imagination of our fair readers we for our part knowing the clemency of the sex incline to think that he did vol ii mine honour is my life shakspeare be waiting soon after dark my dearest i leonora at the balcony of you apart ment and when you see me holding np a torch in the little boat upon the lake steal unobserved if possible from the castle and come to meet me at the waterside i must see you must pour my sorrows into your sympathizing bosom must take leave of you possibly for ever your unhappy brother fernando juan carlos de guzman for the twentieth time donna leonora read her beloved brothers letter as she stood leaning upon the beautifully carved stone work of the balcony watching the appointed signal her husband was absent and the mystery in the delivery of the billet had excited the attention of her serving maidens olivia and ursula and had even awakened in their coarser minds accustomed to the not unfrequent flirtations of spanish beauties suspicions that their grave and highminded lady hitherto so inaccessible and so spotless was at last about to listen at least to one amongst her innumerable admirers the disguise of the letter bearer and the silence and secrecy of his own approach were so far as don garcia was concerned wholly unnecessary but donna leonora aware of the untamed perhaps untameable impetuosity of her brothers character an only brother and most fondly beloved p 2 and of his impatience of contradiction and doubtful also how far what she had to hear might be connected with the political convulsions of these troubled times and certain of her husbands just reliance upon her affection and prudence resolved to obey implicitly don fernandos directions to wait in the balcony until she perceived the signaltorch and then to hasten to meet him by the edge of the lake as she stood leaning on the carved stonework her guitar at her side the beams of the full moon striking on her rich jewels and her commanding beauty and illumining the splendid mansion of which she was the undisputed mistress from one of whose opened windows peeped forth the inquisitive and laughing serving maidens the contrast that contrast so fifrequent in this world of contradictions between the splendour and gaiety of outward circumstances and the cares and anxieties of the inner mind the wide difference in short between appearance and reality was most strikingly exemplified to the eye she was bright fair sweet and calm as the flowers clustered in their sculptured vase that waved above her head diffusing beauty and fragrance around her but as the flowerleaf is subject to influences from without shaken by the night wind and battered by the rain so is that sentient and delicate blossom the human heart liable to be swayed by the changeful gusts of passion and feeling and even when in itself equable and firm it is but too often torn and shattered by sympathy with the sufferings and injuries of the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the objects of its best affections and so it fared with the gentle leonora at this moment when awakening from a long reverie occupied in vain guesses as to the purport of the letter which lay by her side she glanced suddenly down towards the lake and saw the signaltorch gleaming high above the waters in a few minutes the brother and sister were standing together in earnest conversation beneath a group of cedar and cypress and portugal laurel through whose dark foliage the moonbeams struck in bright fitful gleams as the cool breeze of evening swayed the huge branches he insulted me leonora before the whole regiment called me a rash hotheaded boy and when i sent the young conte de merit to him to demand an apology or to appoint the time and weapons for a meeting he refused to stentor him or answer him otherwise than by saying that his regard for my fathers memory his old comrade in arms alone prevented him from putting me under arrest for sending a challenge to my superior officer that for this time he forgave me but that i had need look to it for that the next breach of discipline should be visited upon me with all the rigour of military law and this from manuel hernandez to a descendant of the house of guzman and he survives and i surface and all redress is closed against me by military discipline forsooth military discipline well i have removed that barrier have thrown up my commission and if upon my return to madrid he refuse me the satisfaction that i require i will leave spain leave europe i the world does not want wages in which the son of an old castilian even if he abandon his estates his rank his country may win for himself enough to maintain life without forfeiting that without which life is worthless honour alas my dearest fernando my most dear brother exclaimed donna leonora in the deepest affliction can you speak thus of leaving your country of abandoning the princely name and the princely home of our ancestors of deserting now in the moment when she most needs the defence of every loyal cavalier the young and innocent sovereign in the assertion of whose rights you took so vivid an interest above all can you think of forsaking me true i have a kind and an honourable husband but even his affection would not suffice for my happiness if you the playmate of my childhood the companion and friend of my maturer years my dear brother my only living relation were to become a wanderer and an exile speak to my husband fernando he too is a soldier and a noble castilian consult him what was the commencement of this unlucky quarrel don manuel hernandez has a lovely daughter the donna seraphina respecting whom he is known to be singularly tenacious surely her name was not mentioned between ye his daughter quotha replied the fiery youth i never saw her have hardly heard that such a person existed don diego velasquez and myself were speaking of a stranger clearly a lady of distinction a beauty whom we had met together on the prado and whom i had subsequently seen oftener indeed than i cared to tell him at early mass at the church of the holy trinity he dared to compare with this angel pure dignified gracious and graceful i have never spoken to her but i am sure that she is all this there is an evidence of bearing and of countenance to say nothing of the careful attendance of two old domestics whose appearance vouches for the station and the character of their mistress he dared to compare with her a jewish girl picked up in some of the alleys of the city and it was my indignation at this insult offered to a virtuous lady which provoked the interference of colonel hernandez who had entered unobserved during the dispute don diego apologised he is a slight boy a trivial jester who would crack jokes at his mothers deathbeds or his fathers tomb but hernandez and to refuse me all explanation all redress to disgrace me before my comrades and then to stand upon his seniority his military discipline the day would come he said when i should repent my violence death will arrive before that day farewell my leonora women cannot comprehend these feelings schooled before all his officers and he expects that i shall submit that i shall rejoin the regiment to be pardoned it maybe or schooled again by st ago the gentleman is modest farewell my precious sister my own leonora may the holy virgin watch over you forget me my best leonora i can never forget you and he broke from her affectionate embrace leaped into the boat that awaited him and rowed rapidly to the opposite shore where jose his faithful domestic attended with his horses the weather was singularly fine even for that delicious climate the moon nearly at full reigned in the clear and deepblue sky like a milder sun throwing a silvery light upon the wild and beautiful scenery the deep and richly wooded glens threaded by mountain streams and surmounted by the abrupt precipices and rugged steeps of the sierra guadarrama into the defiles of which a few hours riding had now brought them even the stormy passions of man were insensibly soothed by the peaceful sights and the harmonious sounds of nature the calm sweetness of the night the lulling sound of the wind amongst the willows and distant fall of waters gushing from a rock and the balmy odours of the costumes the wild thyme and the thousand aromatic herbs that sprang around him on every side unconsciously his anger was yielding to milder thoughts as he wended his way taking at the guidance of jose or the will of his steed the nearest but leastfrequented road to madrid when on emerging from a grove of corktrees and entering a straight and narrow valley where the rude carttrack woimd between tall and almost inaccessible crags celebrated as the resort of the banditti formed in these times of civil war by the refuse of either army he was startled from his meditations by the repeated sound of a pistolshot and the shrill screams of female voices and saw right before him in the moonlight a carriage drawn by mules with one or two unarmed attendants who overpowered by superiority of numbers and the suddenness of the attack were on the point of surrendering to halfadozen ferocious looking savages armed to the teeth who were so intent on their booty that they did not perceive the newcomers

from fernando s pistol which levelled the wretch to the earth the faithful jose seconded his master the driver of the carriage and the attending servants encouraged by the unexpected succour rallied round their lady and in a few minutes the assailants dismayed by the loss of their captain and alarmed also by the sound of horses advancing along the highway fled the field don fernando advanced to

than fighting for neither could tell what said don manuel after a few minutes passed in the warmest expressions of gratitude on the part of the father and daughter you will understand my good young friend that i had heard enough of your conversation with don diego to be convinced that you were speaking of seraphina without exactly knowing the degree or the manner of your acquaintance with her this occasioned my taking up the matter with undue warmth upon discovering however how matters stood i was actually on my road to your excellent sister donna leonora to commission her to mediate between us and as you confess to having left her in some trouble why i think with your permission we had better proceed thither now she will forgive our untimely visit for the sake of its object there is little need to say with how much delight don fernando acceded to this proposition or how much more delicious the silver light of the moon </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> moon the lulling soit of wind and waters and the balmy scent of the shrubs which hung heavy with the night dew from the romantic defiles of the sierra guadarrama seemed to the lover when traversed at the side of his beloved it was long past midnight when they arrived at the castle to the unspeakable pleasure of its fair mistress and a little to the disappointment of her waiting maids who found to their no small amazement that the cavalier of the signaltorch was no other than their ladys own brother therefore his age was as a lusty winter frosty but kindly shakspeare no oscar no your young master is deerstalking today dont you hear the gun which has startled jessy so woefully he does not want you just now oscar his view before firing that startling gun which wo is me will have more than frightened the poor pretty vol it q deer for allan is such a shot that he seldom misses his aim his view before he frightened jessy and awakened the echoes and brought down the red deer with that sudden shot was to creep towards them quietly and stealthily he does not want the good hound oscar today oscar must stay with his mistress and as the lovely agnes macdonald spoke coaxingly these coaxing words her small fair hand thrown around oscars neck as he stood beside her the noble animal looked up in her face with his bright intelligent eyes delighting in the sweetness of the voice comprehending or seeming to comprehend the meaning of the words and acquiescing most contentedly in her decision there was certainly no great hardship in standing at the side of agnes macdonald the beautiful and the kind and with looks that spoke as plainly as looks could speak his affection and his gratitude her honest and faithful favourite somewhat of the largest and roughest for a ladys pet lay down in calm and quiet happiness at her feet her fair companion the highbon and graceful jessy stewart who startled as agnes had truly said at the sudden sound of allan macdonalds gun had been standing in some dismay behind her friend now that the shock was passed advanced smilingly and found a seat upon the bank beside her how fond you are agnes of that huge dog i what would the exquisite who hovered round you in london and in paris say if they saw you in full dress too not as i am snorted and plaided like a highland lassie with your jewelled hand resting upon that shaggy head and his long rough body reclined upon the satin skirt i what would they say to i a2 that my dainty laddie as old cannot is wont to call you and what matters what they say or think jessy responded the warmhearted maiden kindling into a dignity of youthful beauty and unconscious stateliness pure delicate and graceful as the attitude of a swan upon mountain or lake or the station of a doe amongst her native glens what care i for the exquisite of paris or of london not half as much as for the mountain posy which you have been collecting the harebell and the heathersprig and our own elegant and abundant scottish rose what is the worth of a wilderness of such monkeys compared to that of our noble faithful oscar what would be the amount of their services ina whole century measured with those which he has rendered to us why did you never hear continued agnes observing the surprised look with which her friend regarded her evident excitement did you never hear of poor oscars exploits in the hard winter live years back no you were in germany at the time and it was before allans attachment and your return of affection nay jessy a princess would have no cause to blush for loving such a man as my brother it was before this affiance so gratifying to us all had given you a daughters interest in the affaus of our house if you are not afraid of a long story i will tell you why it is that from the oldest to the youngest wo all consider oscar not merely as a noble animal but a benefactor and a friend you know the pride and delight of our family my little sister jean but you did not know the beloved and venerable relative my dear and excellent grandfather of whom she was from the moment she could totter across the room climb into his lap and hang prattling round his necks the prime pet and favourite he doted upon the sturdy hardy merry little girl with her joyous smile and her joyous temper so fearless open frank and kind and she in her turn idolized the fine cheerful benevolent old man her most alert playmate and most indulgent friend oh how they loved each other and what a picture it was to see them together he at nearly eighty still upright robust and vigorous in foim with a regular oval countenance high noble features hazel eyes bright and keen as a falcons a mouth of feminine sweetness a fine open forehead a magnificent baldhead and long curling hair as white as the snow on ben isevis contrasting with his clear ruddy complexion the very hue of a ripe peach oh what a sight it was to see that beautiful old man so full of health and life and glee and kindliness tossing about that rosy laughing child with the activity of youth never weary of humouring her pretty fancies and going even beyond her in innocent mirth and fun and frolic how jeanie loved him how we all loved him the dear and venerable man so generous and frank so openhearted and guileless himself so unsuspicious of guile in others so full of honourable thoughts and disinterested and affectionate feelings how proud we all were of a relative whose cheerful and venerable age accorded so well with his virtuous and active youth the southron estimating little except the conventional benefits of wealth or station are apt to sneer at our pride of ancestry and perhaps we may a little overvalue that mere string of names that long roll of parchment a pedigree but a progenitor like sir allan macdonald or as he preferred to be called kilburnie a living example for all that is true and just and honourable and kind cannot be too pigmy appreciated his family his clansmen his very countrymen were proud of the good old man whose sweet and genial temperament diffused gaiety and happiness around him he was a blessing to the whole country you will be a happy woman jessy if my dear brother the heir of his estates and his name should as heaven grant he may fulfil the promise of his youth and inherit also the frank and winning virtues to which his grandfather owed his extensive and remarkable popularity sir allan being a widower and my mother a widow she and her three children allan jeanie and myself lived with him at kilburnie jeanie younger than either of us by ten years and a posthumous child being as i have said his playmate and companion whilst oscar then in his prime whom my grandfather still a keen sportsman valued above all greyhounds for his speed if my venerable kinsman in his universal candour and charity had a prejudice it was against the sleek highbred finelimbed dogs which form the pride of the southern courser and oscar had won a cup from a round dozen of competitors from newmarket brought on purpose to oppose him and whom jeanie delighted in for his gamesomeness was the constant attendant of their long rambles in spring summer autumn and winter in every season and in all weathers would the active old man sally forth with the hardy little girl sometimes holding him by the hand or when weary carried in his arms and the good hound oscar bounding on before them he had an innocent pride in dropping in with jeanie in his hand at houses at a considerable distance particularly at the residences of his daughters and grandchildren for his daughters older than my father an onlyson and early married had scattered his descendants over the country and replying with a chuckling glee when questioned about horses and servants that he had walked that he left such effeminate as coaches and flunkies to those who needed them and was ready to dance a reel with the youngest lassie present and it should go hard but he would tire her down and jeanie herself will keep it up with any lad of her inches wont you jeanie and the vaunt would end by the good old man tossing jeanie upon his shoulder and cutting the highland fling to his own music this was his delight a ball was nothing without his presence if you had but </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> but seen the nod and the wink the fulness of his glee the overflow of his goodhumour his archness in suspecting and sagacity in detecting which lad and lassie would like to come together for the dance ay and sometimes for longer than the dance how he would reconcile old feuds and cement new friendships ay and how he would use the influence of age and character and property even to the very stretch of his interest to smooth difficulties and turn dim and distant wishes into present realities many a hopeful youth has owed his prosperity many a gentle maiden her happiness to the unwearied benevolence of the kind and men sir allan one christmas he went to glencora accompanied as usual by jeanie and oscar to keep the birthday of his favourite daughter lady macleod my brother was detained at home by a slight indisposition and the weather was so severe that my mother always delicate was afraid to venture i myself being too young to be regularly introduced and too tall to pass for a child sir allan had fixed to return on xew years eve the succeeding day being always one of high festivity at kilbumie the servants and neighbours dining in the great hall and the whole castle being alive with festivity and jollity it was an occasion on which we felt that he would be very unwilling to absent himself and yet the day fixed for his return was so tremendous that we took for granted lady macleod would detain her honoured guest at glencora snow had fallen during the whole of the preceding night accompanied by a drifting wind so that to send carriages and horses was impracticable every vestige of the road a wild mountaintrack at the best was impassable or my brother would have gone under the pretence of fetching jeanie for we all knew well that the only shade that ever crossed the brightness of our dear grandfathers countenance was occasioned by his suspicion of being taken care of an affront which the hardy sportsman would have regarded with as much jealousy and displeasure as would be evinced by a veteran of the wars at any precaution that should imply a doubt of his personal prowess this consideration alone deterred my brother from setting forth to glencora in person and as the day grew wilder and wilder all around hill plain and valley covered with a sheet of fragile glittering white with scarcely an hours intermission of incessant snowfall and the night closed in with bitter gusts of wind which blew the frozen and feathery particles against the face with blinding violence even my mother a nervous and timorous woman with a revered parent and a beloved child at stake made up her mind to believe that as it was evidently impossible that the expected guests would reach kilbumie castle on the morrow its master would be content to remain where he was weather less formidable so that it might laye afforded some chance of his finding the road or some probability of the arrival of his guests the next day would have been more alarming to have stirred out in such a fall as this seemed impossible so we went to bed in comfort about an hour after midnight we were awakened by a tremendous noise at the gate of the castle a mixture of scratching and howling upon opening the door it was found to be our friend oscar who instantly singling out my brother leaped upon him with a piteous cry and then went on a little way beyond the gate returning to see if allan followed him who delayed a few minutes to furnish himself with a lantern and men with hurdles mattresses and ropes pulling him by the coatskirts with the most urgent whine wagging his tail when he began to move and enticing him forward by every means in his power oh i shall never forget the poor dogs piteous ways his trembling earnestness his eager looks and the expression of his anxious cry no human voice could have conveyed his meaning more distinctly xever shall i forget that moment nor the hour of agonizing suspense that followed they were saved inquired jessy anxiously breaking silence for the first time oscar led his party to a hollow by the hillside about three miles distant and there the venerable old man was found leaning against the rock in a halfrecumbent posture so as to shelter the child who was clasped to his bosom the snow was gathering around them sleep had crept upon both and in another hour all help would have been unavailing but they were saved again inquired jessy thanks to oscars fidelity and intelligence they were by proper care they both recovered sufficiently to dance at the proposed festival on old iew years day our dear grandfather lived in health and happiness until last year just before we had the happiness of renewing our friendship with your family and jeanie is you know as lively and as lifelike a little personage as treads this most excellent earth and now my dearest jessy do you wonder that oscar look at him poor fellow he knows that we are talking of him do you wonder that this noble and sagacious animal should be my pet i gaoler look to him tell not me of mercy shakespeare else i beseech thee isidore if the peace and comfort why do i name such words if the very existence of thy poor wife be dear to thee i implore thee flee by the memory of our young loves by the happy days we have known together by that closer and dearer tie the sorrows that we have shared by the precious vol n k boy at whose couch we watched in vain by the smiling girl who now lies lapped in the unconscious sleep of infancy by the dead for whom we mourned and by that living blessing whom god in his mercy sent to compensate that mighty woe by a fathers hopes and a fathers duties i conjure thee flee see i am tall the cloak hangs nearly as low over thy ancles as over mine thou needst but droop a little thy manly form as if in grief oh what wife could walk erect from the prison of her husband thou hast but to diaw the capote over thy brow and to let fall the veil and hold thy handkerchief to thy eyes alas did i ever leave thee other than weeping and thou wilt pass undiscovered or suffer me to arrange this hair and thou mayest defy detection dost thou not remember how often in our wooing days w8 have passed for brother and sister how often thou thyself hast vowed avhen thy comrades have been vaunting the delicate bloom of their blueeyed maidens that thou didst rather prize the swart skin and jetty eye of the rich south than the dainty red and white of their rosetipped beauties alas it was the love in that eye that won thy heart and canst thou now resist its appeal now that love and life hang upon thy consent flee my isidore if thy wife if thy child be dear to thee wrap thee in this disguise and flee and leave thee here to perish nay my husband nay not to perish but to join thee speedily in some distant land and live a calm and blissful life in safety and in freedom wrap thyself in this cloak and away away then i conjure thee the patrole vill soon go their rounds and the sentinel who is now on duty will be changed nay i have r 2 not taken him into our counsel look not reproachfully but well i know that andie dual will show nought but respect and sympathy when he sees me or one whom he takes for me pass in soitow from the place dally no longer lisette waits without to conduct thee to her mothers abode one of the old niches about kotre dame where thou lightest be safe for ages there thou shalt stay until the search be passed and then we will depart for americanay wherefore shake thy head i shall be safe and free be sure of that the imperial josephine although even she may not venture to intercede for one who has so transgressed the hard iron martial law as to challenge his superior officer will yet full surely protect her favoured handmaiden one whose wedding she was graciously pleased to honour with her presence from the effects of her wifely love alas was i not the wretched cause of this calamity is it not through thy love for me that thou art still in prison and wilt thou deny me the blessed privilege of setting thee free and no longer able to resist her persuasions colonel de gouibillon did submit to array himself in adeles </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> adeles garments and having safely passed the sentinel on guard was in a few minutes following the steps of mademoiselle lisette from the prison of la force to the precincts of notre dame the escape was complete and successful but an unexpected circumstance rendered poor adeles stratagem unavailing and replaced isidore once again in his dungeon and in all the peril attendant upon a breach of military law under the iron rule of napoleon it was a right queenly chamber tha boudoir into which the soft air of an april morning stole so wooingly and yet its pervading beauty spoke rather of elegance than of splendour the prevailing taste of its fair and gentle mistress was everywhere visible flowers pictured to the life by the deft needle of the embroidered bordered the pale pink hangings which shed a tender blush over the apartment flowers bright from the loom of arras seemed strewn in gay confusion over the rich but delicate carpet flowers fresh from the dewy gardens glowed in the flowerpainted jars of sevres porcelain which crowded the marble tables whilst plants the fairest and choicest of the hothouse and conservatory were grouped in alabaster vases catching the soft light of the veiled windows on a grecian couch near a halfcurtained recess sat a gracious and graceful lady the fitting inmate of this scene of enchantment her dress even to the lilies in her bosom and the provence rose in her hand was of pure and spotless white the most exquisite in texture and most becoming in form her shape and features were faultless in contour and expression if the bloom of youth were faded it was more than replaced by sweetness and sensibility at the moment of which we write that lovely countenance wore the gentlest look of pity as she addressed a sad and weeping lady who had just been admitted to her presence ma pauvre adele i had heed and believed that you were still the joyful occupant of your husbands prison i never thought to be so sorry to see you at st cloud colonel de roussillon is then retaken not retaken may it please your majesty he accomplished his escape in safety and reached a retreat where he might have remained undiscovered until the day of doom but the sentinel who watched the door of his cell on the evening of his departure was to be held responsible for his prisoner had not isidore surrendered himself that poor soldier must have now been the victim and dearly as i love my husband or rather because i do love him dearly i could not have wished him so saved he is again in prison and the sentinel free was that sentinel an accomplice in the escape non my word of honour gracious madam he was my foster brother the son of my good old nurse and would not as we well knew raise the veil or pull away the handkerchief from as he supposed a weeping life as a rougher warder might have done but we took more than common pains to preserve him from all suspicion of our plans for his sake and our own poor andre he at least will escape and after all what was the cause of this unhappy challenge alas alas royal madam i was the thrice unhappy and most unconscious cause walking on the boulevard italien with madame le vasseur general pillared heated as he says by wine and mistaking me for my cousin pauline de st brie your imperial majesty has often noticed our sisterlike resemblance to whom as it now appears he has been for some months secretly married accosted me in a manner which occasioned me the most lively alarm my husband came up at the moment the general certainly not himself and hardly aware of his mistake treated the matter with provoking levity madame le vasseurs presence and my tears put for the time an effectual check on isidore he hurried us home and then wrote that unhappy letter that challenge to a superior officer which falling i hardly know how into the hands of the minister at war constitutes the sole and fatal proof of his breach of martial law for general pillared as much distressed as man can be and full of selfblame and selfaccusation denies all recollection except of his own misconduct if that fatal letter could be regained or destroyed or if the real facts of the case could be brought under the notice of him in whose word will lie the final sentence the awful doom of life or death if he could know the provocation the palliation he that soul of honour who holds his imperial consorts purity as the brightest jewel of his crown how often have we heard him quote caesars axiom here a slight movement of caution and perhaps of uneasiness on the part of josephine and a noise like the rustling of papers suddenly stopped adeles pleadings and directed her attention to the half curtained recess it opened on a small turret chamber fitted up as a private study and at a writing table folding a letter sat a gentleman plainly dressed ina singlebreasted green coat a white kerseymere waistcoat and the ribbon of the legion of honour at his buttonhole his little cocked hat was on a chair at his side and although his noble head was bent over the letter which he was folding adele felt at once that it was no other than napoleon papers were strewed before him and amongst these the eyes of the trembling wife rested upon her husbands wellknown writing the challenge upon which his fate and hers depended the emperor paused in his occupation and applied to his snuffbox for his habitual luxury his countenance was calm and untroubled and but for a momentary glance towards the curtained doorway it might have been doubted if he were conscious that he was not alone speak i whispered josephine encouragingly plead your husbands cause five minutes before madame de gourdillon would have given her right hand for such an opportunity now it had amved and between reverential awe of her great master and the tremendous interest which she had at stake she knelt before him weak and wordless as a child pardon sire pardon her voice died away and had not a passion of tears come to relieve her she would have fainted napoleon made no answer he was about to seal the letter which he had folded and selecting a paper from the table he first used it to light the wax taper which stood in a richly chased golden candlestick by his side and then flung it into the brazier tapping his snuffbox ashe watched the burning fragments and glancing upon the happy wife and her sympathizing mistress with a smile exquisite in its sweetness and beauty perhaps at that moment his sensations were the most enviable of the three need i say that the paper which he had destroyed was the only proof of isidores guilt the allimportant cartel for love thou knowst is full of jealousy shakspeare it as on a bright balmy eying towards the end of july that half the population of this sunny side of berkshire were pouring through the suburbs of belford eegis on their return from the annual festival popularly called the cherry fair because it forms the great mart for the waggonloads of that luscious fruit which blacken the orchards skirt the beech woods and dot the commons of that wild and beautiful tract of country which runs along the northern banks of the thames carriages of every variety from the lordly landau our story bears date some five and forty years back with its four prancing steeds and its liveried outriders to the humble caravan crowded with women and children already fretful from the fatigue which in lower as in higher life treads so close upon the heels of pleasure all sorts of wheeled vehicles chariots phaetons curricles gigs and carts horsemen of every rank and footpeople of all ages and denomination some tipsy some sober some merry some sad all came pouring from the fair and the stu and movement of the different groups the sound of so many passengers talking laughing hallooing and whooping mingled with the distant noises of the scene of action where the ringing of bells the beating of drums the lowing of cattle and the blowing of trumpets contended with and at times nearly overpowered the mingled hum of the multitude formed a scene which lighted by the bright beams of a midsummer sun and fanned by the pleasant evening breeze had something peculiarly exhilarating in its aspect and character standing upon the hill which parts belford eegis from aberleigh and looking towards the old town its towers and steeples glittering in the sunshine its venerable buildings mingled with groves and gardens and crowned with terraces of a lighter and gayer style </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> style of architecture the clear waters of the bennet spanned by noble bridges and crowded with barges and pleasure vessels whilst river bridges streets and quays were all alive with the gay and stirring population rolling its apparently inexhaustible tides upward from the good toni and then onward through broad avenues and tufted lanes into the neighbouring country beyond looking from the point it was scarcely possible for the coldest observer not to be gratified by a spectacle so full of innocent although somewhat boisterous gaiety and wide spreading enjoyment among the most gratified of these spectators was a somewhat sternlooking dame who sat in her own porch before a small farmhouse just without the suburbs of belford eegis and took off her spectacles and laid aside her knitting to survey her pretty granddaughter susan who followed by two fine boys her brothers one beating most lustily a childs drum the other shouldering with great pride and valour a toy musket approached slowly from the fair susan wharton was one of the prettiest lasses of the country side and her sweetvol ii s ness and modesty equalled her beauty she and her brothers were orphans but had been carefully brought up by her fathers mother the venerable matron of the knittingneedle and the spectacles who having a small but excellent pasturefarm close to the town and being an active stirring bustling dame accomplished in all the arts of the dairy contrived to make a good living for herself and her grandchildren by supplying the inhabitants with cream milk butter and other pastoral luxuries lone woman though she were the world had gone well with her and she had scarcely known a care since the sudden and almost simultaneous death of her son and her sons wife except indeed the dread occasioned by the perversity and headstrong temper of eobert goring her pretty grand daughters favoured suitor who whenever a fit of jealousy came across him which was far oftener than ought to have occurred considering the reserve and prudence of his fair mistress but when did jealousy listen to reason was sure to avenge himself by threatening to turn soldier a threat of all others most grievous to dame whartons ears whose eldest grandson having enlisted during his fathers life had thereby occasioned to his affectionate relatives a species of trouble and anxiety unknown in the traditions of that peaceful family since the time of a certain rupert wharton some of poor james who had followed the fortunes of his illustrious namesake and fallen in the kings service during the civil wars jems delinquency and the threat to follow his example so frequently held outby eobert goring had so strongly impressed dame whartons imagination that her natural pride and pleasure at the sight of her blooming grandchildren was some 2 what lessened by the martial array in which the two boys presented themselves i suppose it s some foolish present of eobert goring s said the good dame to her faithful adherent jenny stubbs a short damsel who assisted in the care of the cows as well as in carrying milk and better about the town and had been left to attend her mistress during the absence of her gigrandchildren it s certainly some folly of eobert s for i am sure that susan would never have given the boys such nonsensical toys fit only to put war and soldiering and such nonsensical notions into their heads poor children but where is eobin added she as susan approached sand what ring is that upon your finger you have not gone to church without leave or licence to be sure susan now that all s arranged for your being married at christmas when eobert is settled in his own little farm i wonder what his uncle master goring the cooper who has been as good as a father to him would say to that speak child cant you are you married yes or no or has eobert bought the ring beforehand and got you to put it on in this way to make a fool of your old grandmother no indeed returned susan i would not have done anything so disrespectful to you grandmother for twenty robins this is no weddingring no said her grandmother assuming her spectacles to take a second view of the slender finger and the glittering gem which encircled it and comparing both with her own hard ruddy hand xo exclaimed she eyeing it more intently this gimcrack isnt such a ring as i was married with but why dost wear it upon thy weddingfinger child and who gave it to thee eh eobin ah hes a foolish boy to throw away so much money i warrant it cost a good halfguinea and the boys and their nonsense ah those young heads i warrant hes been finely cheated eobert bought it in the fair no indeed grandmother responded susan not eobert who then inquired dame whatton with great sternness how dare you accept a present from any one else ah child child she that takes rings from fresh acquaintance little deserves that an honest man should seek to put one upon her weddingfinger who gave it to you hussy speak i say who gave you the ring i must not tell you his name dear grandmother began susan with great agitation i have promised not to tell you wrong me grandmother indeed you do sobbed the weeping beauty it was no fresh acquaintance indeed indeed it was not but i cannot tell his name i have promised not to tell anyone not even eobert or you athk me interrupted the young gentleman with the musket interposing between his angry grandmother and his frightened sister with an alacrity and boldness of bearing which together with his readiness and shrewdness of speech contrasted laughably with an infantine lisp from which ised his younger brother he of the drum was perfectly free athk me grandmother and dont thcold poor thither thuthan athk me i know the whole thtowy pursued master willy shifting his weapon most energetically with both hands from shoulder to shoulder brother jem the roger s come to belford bawled ned shouting at the top of his voice to overcome the noise of his own drum yet resumed willy when brother deem put the wing on thither finger lie pwomethed to make mea drummer a weal drummer not a than like ined but a weal drummer and me a fifer shouted ned still accompanying himself with his noisyan instrument hath thorn hath ever i with hath tall hath the musket provided resumed this discreet keeper of secrets provided we never thai a syllable of with being at the fair a weal drummer think of that and a real fifer drummer and fifer fifer and drummer shouted the boys in chorus and brother deem can make me a drummer added master willy in a confidential whisper addressed to his grandmother for he th a therdzeant and earth a thwath a therdzeant with a think thwath not silk interposed ned worsted think i that rejoined willy and the one beating a grand tattoo and the other shouldering arms off the two boys marched each shouting at the top of his childish voice think worsted worsted think until the sound was lost in the distance jem a serjeant and at belford but why not come here susan and why desire you to keep his being there a secret i dont see any msdom in such secrets said the good dame shaking her head and poor eobin what 11 he say i wonder and why does jem desire you to wear this foolish ring it s enough to make the lad enlist in good earnest why dear grandmother thats the very thing that jem wants not that he should enlist in reality grandmother nor that he should go for a soldier but to cure him of these threats and jealousies somebody told james who came to belford this morning reciting how foolish eobin had been about harry goddard and george elton and everybody who spoke to me or looked at me whether i spoke to them or not so when i met him and oh dear grandmother what a fine stately man he is grown and when he found me out for he hardly knew me at first and had kissed me and hugged the boys how pleased he was with willy she insisted on my taking this ring which he received from some great lady to whom he had done a service abroad and brought it here that it might be sold and serve for my he insisted on my wearing it on my weddingfinger and not satisfying eobin s curiosity farther than by telling him solemnly that no lover gave it to me so that either he might put such a trust in my word and my truth as a husband ought to put or if that were too </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> too good to happen that he might enlist in jamess own party and so be let off tomorrow after having a good fright i was not willing to play poor eobin such a trick for you know dear grandmother there was little chance if he saw the ring but he would fly off only james insisted on the misery of a jealous husband and so and so eobert did see the ring and did fly off i thought something was amiss when you came home without him said the grandmother yes 1 sighed susan he did see the ring poor fellow as soon as ever he rejoined me he had been to help his aunt and cousins into their cart when i met james he did see the ring and asked me over and over again how i came by it and who gave it to me willy and ned were gone with james to see punch and the wild beasts or else but i had promised james not to tell and thank heaven eobert said nothing of enlisting this time so that i hope all will go right heaven send it may said her careful grandame but i love no secrets and playing at enlisting is playing with edgetools hearken busy if eobert should come here tonight send him to me i must go see after the skimming and with a nod as eloquent as lord burleighs the good dame repaired to her dairy susan although somewhat comforted by dame whartons last speech could not quite get rid of certain apprehensions that clung about her she hummed unconsciously her grandmothers favourite ditty i hate yon drums discordant sound parading round and round and round whenever the distant noise of the recruiting party reached her from the toni or the din of poor neds new toy echoed through the mansion and over and over again did she lament the attractions of punch and of the lions elephants and monkeys which had detained willy from her side at a moment when his genius for explanations would have been invaluable to her unhappy lover for accustomed to love eobert faults and all and almost persuaded to consider his rash and violent but often repented and easily appeased jealousy as a proof of the strength of his passion the softhearted beauty was more alive to the danger of losing her betrothed than to the peril in which this solitary failing might place her future happiness she even contemplated the possibility of sending willy in quest of her luckless swain but again the great show of wild beasts stood in her way it had so happened that poor eobin himself always generous especially to the boys whom their sister loved so dearly had presented them the christmas before with a dutch toy called a noahs ark consisting of a curiously fashioned compound of boat and house filled not merely with the quaintly habited wooden figures representing the patriarchs family attired with an amplitude of apparel and a splendour of colouring which did honour to the hollanders fancy but with a variety of pairs of animals decked in hues almost as splendid and quite as unlike nature as those with which the dutch artist had bedecked our antediluvian progenitors over this toy preserved for them with great care by the grandmother the young students in natural history were quietly seated so deeply engaged in comparing those beasts which they had seen in the morning with their wooden prototypes in the ark where by the way they were most artificially stowed one above the other the receptacle being scarcely capable of containing them when shoved in en masse whence divers accidents to leg and tail head and horn that nothing short

to supper and to bed susan reluctantly abandoned all hope for that evening at least of undeceiving her devoted but irascible lover before dawn the next morning the young damsel who slept in a small chamber of which the casement overhung the garden heard a low tap at her window accompanied by the peculiar birdlike whistle which had so often summoned the rustic juliet late and early to the brief delight of a stolen dialogue with her enamoured eomeo wrapping a large cloak about her susan stood leaning her hand against the open window eobin dear eobin vol ii t eobert could not see the rosy lips wych spoke these few and simple words but the tone sweet gentle caressing affectionate implied all that could be imagined of truth and tenderness it was a tone as sweet and open as her own sweet smile he mustered all his indignation to resist the charm and succeeded i come here susan said eobert in low resolute accents to ask you for the last time from whom and for what purpose you received the ring which i saw you wear yesterday by heaven i see it now glittering in the moonlight answer this question or we part for ever it is a question eobin which i have promised not to answer at present i can only tell you that i received it from no one who can interfere with our attachment more i must not cannot tell must not cannot say will not rejoined eobert in a voice of deep and concentrated anger say will not susan once again and for the last time i ask you this plain question from whom did you receive this gewgaw answer or may my right hand be struck off before i place the weddingring on your finger oh dearest eobin grant me but a few short hours believe my word dear eobert confide in my affection in my faith exclaimed the poor girl as her lover turned furiously away or ask my grandmother added she or inquire of willy they are bound by no promise continued she not regarding in her anxiety how much she was infringing her own but if she did break her word it was to little purpose the jealous lover fled from the garden hearing or unheeding and although no threat of enlisting had been spoken no farewell had been breathed she remained persuaded that he had taken his measures and with something t 2 very like a presentiment that her brothers hasty plan would as deception however well intended often does lead to evil rather than to good and so it proved before noon on the next day tames wharton learnt that eobert goring had enlisted the night before not with his party but with one belonging to another regiment stationed in belford for the occasion of the fair that immediately upon ascertaining that susan still refused to answer his question he had repaired to his sergeant kite to announce his continued desire to enter the service that as soon as admittance could be obtained he had been examined and attested before the mayor and other magistrates and that he and the recruiting party were by that time some miles on their way to the depot of the regiment it was in the very heat of the peninsular war men were scarce especially men so tall and finely formed so spirited and so active as poor eobert it was impossible to procure his release and james and his sister were left to bewail the ill consequences of his unlucky experiment and dame wharton to lament again and again the evil destiny which led her descendants and those connected with them to go as she phrased it a sogeinng the only comfort she derived upon the </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> the occasion next perhaps to that general scolding of the guilty and the innocent the efficacy of which as a consolation under affliction is well known to most ancient dames well to do in the world who wear spectacles knit stockings and love their own way her prime comfort consisted in cutting ineds drum to pieces to the great improvement of the tranquillity of the rustic homestead and in throwing willys musket into the fire tears passed away the poor boys grown into fine stout lads tended the cows and carried the milk through the streets of belford eegis exhibiting no more dangerous warlike propensities than an inordinate ambition on the part of willy to possess a gun for the purpose of shooting sparrows nothing had been heard of eobert and james wharton now serjeantmajor of his regiment remained at a distance sharing the perils and the victories of the british army still however dame wharton all peaceful as were her inclinations had the ill luck to find the destinies of those she loved unexpectedly influenced by the warlike spirit of the times poor susan restless and unhappy at home had entered into the service of her noble landlords daughter as her own woman and during the short peace which preceded napoleons return from elba the lady anne had been wooed and won by one of the gallant staff which surrounded the great duke and too much attached to her husband to remain at a distance from the field of action the young bride and her favourite waitingmaid were actually in brussels during the crowning victory of waterloo you are a soldiers sister susans said the lady anne to her attendant with her usual sweet grace a few days after the great battle have you any objection to go with me this morning to the military hospital a private belonging to my husbands division threw himself between him and a french cuirassier who was about to cut him down with his sabre and received the blow destined for sir charles of course every care has been taken of him and he is likely to recover poor fellow thank heaven but i wish to carry him a few comforts to see with my own eyes that he is kindly attended and thank him with my own lips for preserving a life dearer than my own charles has sent to the surgeon to be in waiting so order the carriage and we will set forth laden with comforts and restoratives mistress and maid proceeded to the hospital neither of them perhaps quite prepared for the inevitable horrors of the scene crowds of soldiers for the most part severely wounded filled the apartment into which they were ushered pain and death seemed busy around them sufferings only the more affecting for the bravery with which they were borne spoke in every countenance young timid and softlynurtured the lady anne overcome by such a realization of the miseries of war as her imagination even so close to the scene had hardly pictured delivered to the friendly surgeon a slip of paper upon which the name of her husbands preserver was written he led the way to a bed near a window poor fellow his wars are over say nay your ladyship must not misunderstand me his life is in no danger but he has been compelled to submit to amputation and as his friends are said to be well off why the empty sleeve in his ease will be only his speech was checked by a sudden exclamation almost a shriek from his patient susan susan wharton my susan eobin dearkobin lady anne knew the story and witnessed the recognition with the sympathy of a young unpractised heart she too had loved a soldier and the poor sufferer now before her had received his hurt in that dear soldiers defence tears contended with smiles as she gazed upon the couple already reunited for susan was hanging over the couch and her hand was locked in that of eobert he looked at her weddingfinger the ring was gone eobin dear eobin her voice failed her i know what you would say susan replied eobert it was your brother james we met in spain and he told me the whole truth do you remember my wicked vow i am a poor maimed object now susan i have no right hand to put the weddingring upon that dear finger but you can put the ring on with the left dear eobin you can put it on with the left said susan smiling through her tears and never in spite of pain and wounds and danger and suffering throbbed two happier hearts than those of the reconciled lovers in the crowded wards of the brussels hospital if thou be he then art thou prisoner shakspeare there have been prisons of more pretension as witness the cells of the inquisition and places of exile of grander name the frozen deserts of siberia for instance or the sweltering swamps of surinam but for a chill barren heartbreaking monotony a weary dreary dragging on of life when all that renders life bearable is taken away commend me to a passion fortress during the reign of that literary coxcomb small poet eminent soldier sad despot but tolerably amusing and by fits tolerably well natured personage frederick misnamed the great to be sure the inmates if it be true that the misfortunes of others convey some consolation in calamity had the wretched comfort of knowing that from the whole country flat dull and ugly enough at the best being little better thana camp or a battle plain the towns and cities huge barracks and every citizen from the tottering great grandfather to the infant in the cradle a soldier past present or future responsible for the slightest infringement of an all but impracticable military code there was not an individual in the kingdom who might not be in an instant imprisoned like themselves but without venturing to dispute the general truth of eochefoucaults celebrated maxim it may be doubted whether the captive pacing for the millionth time the stone floor of his dungeon and vainly trying to divine the fault for which he was incarcerated could derive much pleasure from reflecting that half his friends and kinsmen might at some future day be in equal jeopardy next in discomfort to the prisoners within those dismal cells were the jailers who kept ward without and who cooped up between the walls of the fortress were as compared to those whom they guarded pretty much as birds in an aviary compared with the same order of feathered bipeds in a cage at spandau the commandant major klein wits an invalid soldier found so much difficulty in obtaining assistants for hans klaus who had the dungeons in charge that he thought himself lucky in gaining the service of a pretty youth who called himself wilhelm steinfort an orphan who having recently lost an only brother cared he said nothing for the world without the walls and showed great zeal in assisting klaus who lame from the consequences of an old wound found much difficulty in passing up and down the steep stone stairs whilst carrying their scanty meals to the miserable inmates of the cells two or three distinguished by triple padlocks each boasting its different keys keys whose intricacy and convolutions seemed dim forebodings of the wonders of branch were reserved by klaus for his own especial attendance one should think that wilhelm saw enough of the poor captives but these prisoners seemed to excite his curiosity not a little one morning taking advantage of a fit of good humour on the part of his master and of his masters lady and mistress madame klaus he prevailed upon him to allow each of the poor wretches a solitary walk in a small yard closed in on every side by the steep walls of the fortress and scarcely even at noontide admitting one glimpse of the blessed sun and as they emerged pale and haggard into the light of day he brushed the tears from his eyes and gazed upon their wasted forms and wan complexions with the eagerness with which a mother would seek for a missing child apparently wilhelms search had been in vain one prisoner amongst those most carefully guarded and one alone had not shared an indulgence too dangerous for repetition wilhelm as soon as he ascertained the fact hastened to the triply locked door max and the exclamation of surprise and joy with which that earnest whisper was acknowledged and reciprocated told at a word that the searchwas at an end for three weary days days which although really of the shortest in january seemed long as those of june the triply barred door with its panels of oak and studs of iron remained betwixt them a tantalizing and inexorable barrier at last chance always the good friend of those

twinges as prospero inflicted upon caliban and visited the wife of his bosom madame klaus with such a fit of rheumatic gout most aristocratic of diseases as would have done honour to a baroness of sixteen quarters hans klaus could not have walked across the court to have exchanged the warders keys for a fieldmarshals baton and dame gertrude could not have undone the easiest of the three padlocks to have been made first lady of the key to the empress so they were forced to delegate the office of breadands water carrier to the young boy wilhelm max agatha and the twin brother and sister for such they were lay bathed in tears of mingled joy and sorrow in each others arms how came you here asked agatha when their emotion had in part subsided you max von lindorff the kings page the favourite trusted and beloved almost like a son what can have been your offence how came you here i can as little guess the cause of this imprisonment as you sweet sister i had served the king with wine the night before as he sate at supper with m de voltaire and other gay and witty frenchmen himself gayest of all the next morning adolf von eosenthal agatha i cannot see your blushes but this trembling hand tells of feelings which he would be right glad to hear adolf vol ii u avowed his love and craved my intercession and i was in the act after one or two attempts of sealing a letter to yon when the officer on guard count waldemar entered my apartment put me under arrest and whirled me off here to spandau without a moments pause as little as yourself can i guess the cause and now let me ask of you the same question how came you hither sister mine agatha hesitated and the little hand which had before betrayed her consciousness again trembled as the brother pressed it in his the baron von eosenthal she faltered and her brother filled up the pause adolf aye doubtless he ascertained my destination from count waldemar and then communicated the intelligence to you no truer friend than adolf von eosenthal and yet i would not be sure that my calamity was altogether unwelcome since it procured liii admission to his lady love but now dearest away dally here no longer leave the dungeon and the fortress lay aside your disguise instantly dear max interrupted she laughing and beginning to divest herself of cap and doublet and to replace them by her brothers habiliments instantly we have not a moment to lose it was for this that i came i shall remain in the cell and you must pass for me as aided by the dark wintry weather and our remarkable resemblance of figure voice and face and these my boyish garments you well may do walk boldly into dame gertrudes apartments and proffer to fetch from her gossip claudius the millers wife the decoction of herbs strange as the compound of a witchs cauldron which she wants for her rheumatism once clear of the walls of spandau make straight for the frontier and all will go well no u2 remonstrance no hesitation no delay this purse too take this purse i shall be safe i tell you and when we shall have found out your crime there will be some chance of proving a pardon all will be right provided you be manageable away with you max t and in spite of contention and remonstrance the brother was forced away and the sister remained in his place under a mixture of feelings that found vent first in hysterical laughter then in hysterical sobs and settled down at last into a trembling silence a breathless pause of suspense and expectation during which she seemed to hear her own heart beat as she stood in the gloom and darkness gradually however she became aware of sounds the clang of gate and drawbridge the clattering of arms and trampling of horses which piercing as they did through the massive walls of the inner couii indicated no common confusion in the fortress so that when klaus accompanied by a corporals guard made his appearance in the doorway she was to a certain degree prepared for the discovery of her scheme and the recapture of the prisoner the jailer however appeared still in a state of mystification i knew that i should find master max safe in his apartments muttered hans klaus with considerable exultation my birds seldom get out of their cages come along cant you cried he in a sharp voice to the corporal as he swung along upon his crutches with an activity wholly belying the incapacity of motion of which i spoke a few sentences back that extraordinary and preternatural activity belonging to a lame man when the one motive the key of the clock has been found and the machinery has been fairly set in motion get on i tell you cried the jailer to the corporal i knew that i should find him a prisoner escape from spandau indeed that seems likely agatha had seen and heard enough to take her measures max has been met and stopped and brought back thought she and we are to be confronted isow heaven send him a good gift of impudence and surely that is a commodity in which a court page can hardly be defective and we shall baffle them yet so thinking she followed klaus to the guardroom fully prepared to find that her brother had been arrested but a little disconcerted to see seated in an armchair at the head of the table the identical adust stiff soldierlooking personage with his cocked hat jackboots and shabby unison known to his loving subjects as frederick the great here an please your majesty said klaus pointing with his crutch to the youth in his pages dress whom he poked forward as he spoke here is my prisoner maximilian von landor the other boy is as i said before a lad called wilhelm steinfort whom i and my old dame waxing somewhat stiff have hired to scrub down the courts cut wood and carry water he was only going some quarter of a league for a decoction of bah interrupted the king we did not come here to inquire into thy wifes rheumatism why truly eosenthal i think there be two of them come hither master page both youths advanced to the table i called maximilian von lindorff only added frederick which of you answers to that name i do replied two voices equally musical to the right and left indeed who was your father ernest von lindorff a lieutenantgeneral in your majestys service answered the two voices in duet hiat is your age seventeen the twentieth of last july said both which of ye is the real prisoner i am replied the two wilhelm wilhelm the boy is crazy interposed the jailer hold your peace master klaus said the king quickly according to their own confession here was one prisoner upon the point of escaping i am the prisoner reiterated both which of ye hath a sister the fraulein agatha i have let me finish my sentence quoth his majesty dont be in such haste young sirs you are coming to your sentence fast enough and you master jailer let me see no more winking and nodding and signmaking to the young boy whom thou callst wilhelm but who answers to the name of max canst not thou let him go to the gallows his own way take care of thine own neck master klaus which may be in jeopardy here for playing fast and loose with thy prisoners hearken young sirs pursued his majesty resuming the examination which of ye hath a sister the fraulein agatha there he paused a moment and both were preparing to answer i have the words were forming on each rosy mouth when he continued deliberately who is in love with my aidedecamp here the baron eosenthal the reply which as i have said hung trembling on either tongue was suddenly cut short as the one face covered with blushes after a shy stolen glance at the fellow culprits half amused half sympathizing countenance seemed sinking to the ground with shame whilst eosenthal provoked astonished and confused looked almost as guilty as the prisoners the king went on with his questions you have such a sister then as the young lady who is in love with the baron eh did you speak my lord said frederick interrupting himself as essential vexed at heart for the vexation of his blushing lady love uttered an impatient quirk behind the royal chair hum i thought you wished to suggest some </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> some enquiry monsieur le baron you did not you say well then you have such a sister as this fraulein agatha the inamorato of the baron here and this leads us to the crime for crime it is continued frederick with a degree of seriousness which communicated a corresponding degree of apprehension to all who heard him do you know anything of this bit of paper asked he sternly producing from his pocket a scrap of writing of which the top and the bottom and one comer seemed to be torn off would you believe gentlemen continued the majesty of prussia turning rapidly from major kleinwitz to baron eosenthal would you think it possible that the son of a brave soldier like lindoff who died in my arms on the field of battle that his son brought up in my household treated as a child of my own should write of me in terms like these in terms amounting to treason added he waxing warmer as he described the guilt of the culprit which of ye owns this scroll let none own it lightly for it will be found to contain no slight matter bead it kleinwitz i picked it up myself under the boys window at potsdam i know thewriting well having before now employed the ingrate as my amanuensis head he fixed his eyes on the culprits who listened with surprise and alarm as kleinwits read thus ran the scroll so much for rosenthals petition sweet sister which i pray you to answer favourably you cannot do otherwise for i know that you have long loved him for other matters we go on much as usual the tyrant sphere said kleinwitz some words are missing got drubbed most famously last night by and here some more sire

coldly there is no riddle there the treason is plain and simple and so shall bethe doom suffer me to complete the sentence said one of the culprits producing from the pages dress a morsel of paper which exactly fitted the scrawl in question sister cried max in great perplexity tugging at her sleeve the sleeve of his own doublet upon agathas arm sister for heavens sake better die better live max returned his sister smiling i know what im about and the truth shall out the truth and the whole truth max head major kleinwits no not that nonsense at the beginning added she with a renewal of the shamefacedness which did so much injustice to her pages attire no need to read that nonsense begin there and the good natured commandant read uyyg gg qj much as usual the tyrant of literature voltaire

as written torn away and as i believe destroyed pardon that impertinence and above all forgive her whose only fault was a too deep love of her twin brother pardon sire i beseech thee did old fritz give voltaire a sound drubbing max in the match of wit we played last night good faith i believe he did 1 chuckled the king and thou wilt be glad to be quit of him well if that be the worst treason we

henhouses and pigsties which together with the oldfashioned rambling dwellinghouse large enough to form two or three fine cottageomnes in these degenerate days seen between the various buildings which withall conceivable irregularity surrounded the spacious farmyard glittering with the clean crisp covering of straw with which it was very literally littered and giving due token of their presence by bleating of lambs seeking their mothers and ewes in pursuit of their lambs by barking of dogs and shouting of men and boys were the fine flocks of farmer holden returning from their distant pastures to the fold ina rich meadow near the homestead horses mounted by young carterboys sitting longingly upon their naked backs and riding them to and from the village pond with an indescribable air of lazy pride whilst cows driven by urchins on foot somewhat brisker but every whit as dirty stumbled amongst the sheep and jostled the horses in their haste to reach the calves who were lowing in their

innumerable lesser denizens of this wellpeopled agricultural demesne pigs of all ages and all sizes lay wallowing about the yard and poultry of every denomination from geese and turkeys to bantams and pigeons cackled at the barndoors dabbled in the ponds fluttered discontented in the coops or perched in happy freedom on the roofs of the different buildings whilst one or two small and pretty children one tvith a kitten in his hand leaning over the low hatch gate which extended from side to side of the deep old porch as if longing to escape from this their own peculiar coop added to the general agreeableness of the picture sweetbread in its tender green and its fresh fragrance grew on one side of that old dark porch and an early honeysuckle already putting forth its bud flourished on the other julystocks wallflowers and polyanthuses sent their sweet breath through the lattice windows divided by rich stone scullions a large clierrvtreo waved its snowy blossoms scattering light at one end of the house backed by a rich rosytinted almond scented orchard whilst in a nook between a dark fagotxile and a huge open carthouse the sun glanced upwards on an old eldertree turning the

threescore of callow gaping struggling goslings in the pure doric of berkshire this operation is called pilling the gulls was a young woman of middle height whose person sufficiently well formed but somewhat largeboned and muscular betokened such an union of activity and strength as might probably be more common in the weaker sex if the bountiful intentions of mature were duly seconded by </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> by education and circumstance if girls took more exercise and passed more time in the open air her face could hardly be called pretty far less beautiful and yet in the bright laughing eyes the red lips just enough divided to show the pearly teeth and a dimple on one corner of the mouth the clear healthy sunburnt complexion and an expression compounded of frankness sweetness and gaiety there was more of charm than is often to be found in the most regular beauty and so in good truth thought her companion she from her occupation and her dress her dark cotton gown her double muslin handkerchief her simple cap as well as the sleeves turned up above her elbows and the coloured apron tied over the white one was evidently a farmhouse senhandmaiden just tidied up after going through the most laborious of her many offices j and finishing her days work by supplying the manifold wants of her feathered charges and milking the kine if indeed the calves did not spare her the trouble he a finelooking young man rather tall than short but firmly and rigorously formed with a bright open countenance and a glowing complexion was as evidently a fanners son his straw hat was placed rather on one side on his glossy auburn curls with the true air of a village beau and his dark velveteen jacket and the silk handkerchief just knotted round his throat had as much of real study in the apparent carelessness of their adjustment as would have done honour to the veriest coxcomb of oneandtwenty that ever danced at alacks personal vanity being astonishingly alike in all stations a coxcomb i grieve to say was maurice elliott and yet being heartily in love he had the best chance that could befall him of getting rid of his coxcombry at present however to judge of the dialogue passing between them their course of tiue love was very far from running smooth it was more like a game of cross purposes than a meeting at sunset between two lovers you wont go with me then to the maying phoebe said the youth impatiently twisting round his fingers a long supple branch which he had just twitched from a weeping willow that overhung the goosepond never dreaming the while that he was so far as action went emulating one of the most eloquent women that ever graced blue stockings you wont go with me to the maying you wont try for a prize at the maurice you really wont thy really and indeed you wont rejoined the damsel poking one of her pellets with a little stick down a goslings throat and following the dose by a drop or two of water to clear the passage for another morsel do try maurice i continued she in a tone of voice sweet and round and youthful a spoken smile do try when i know cried maurice still twisting the unlucky bit of willow that you have got leave to go out that very day of course to the maying and not to go with me and maurice gave the bit of willow which he twisted round his finger such a tug with his other hand as had nearly cut that useful member to the bone got leave to go and wont go with me ashen you wont try at the plough hang the ploughingmatch ejaculated maurice shaking his discomfited finger hang the ploughingmatch wien you wont try for a prize continued phoebe quietly taking another gosling upon her lap you who know that you can plough as straight a furrow as old giles dowling himself i hang giles howling phoebe my father was a farmer and though to please him and since his death to humour mother i may have gone between the stilts theres no need to let mysek down iu the eyes of the whole parish what would that cold sneering purseproud uncle of mine and his fine daughters say i wonder come phoebe dont look so grave you 11 go to the maying wont you that can hinder you now that you have got leave come and ill drive you in my own chaisecart with my new chesnut horse what would your proud uncle and your fine cousins say to that i wonder you are a farmers son as you truly say mr maurice elliott and i am a labourers daughter god forbid that i should be ashamed of being the child of an honest man let his condition be ever so poor and phoebe though her tone was gentle drew her stool a little back with an air of selfrespect that approached to dignity her lover felt the reproof forgive me dearest phoebe pray pray forgive me i did not intend i did not dream oh phoebe i never think of you but as one so much better than myself you do forgive me then said he answering the bright dimpled smile which required no words to confirm her pardon you do forgive me and you 11 let me drive you to this maying weare to have a cricketmatch and a dance and it will be so pretty a sight why do you shake your head is there any secret in the matter no secret at all maurice said phoebe ill tell you the truth youll not be ashamed of it though your fine cousins would poor uncle george has been so ill this spring that he has not been able to get his allotment dug or planted and you know the allotment ground is his chief dependence the childen would be half starved without the vegetables and the refuse keeps the pig so father and mother are going to give him a days labour to get in the potatoes and im going to help thats my holy day and a very happy one it will be uncle george was always so good to me and so was aunt and i love the children dearly you 11 see what a days work i shall do dear good phoebe i wish i could help too only i have promised to make one of the eleven and i cant desert them just at last but ill tell you what i can do your little cousin george who lives with us i can let him go home and help another bright smile repaid the kindness but this ploughingmatch maurice that will be a pretty sight too and you who can do everything better than the other lads of the parish why should not you be as proud of being the best ploughman as the best cricketer or the best shot kay but you must listen to me maurice whatever the purseproud uncle or the fine cousins may say i have good cause to believe that your trying for the prize would please one person besides myself you own good landlord colonel lisle maurices brow darkened he drew up his person to his full stature and spoke angrily and bitterly my own good landlord would you believe phoebe that after living upon his estate i and my fathers these three hundred years and more paying his rent to a day and doing as much justice to his land as if it were really our own this good landlord of ours the lease being upon the point of expiring has sent us notice to quit actually sent us notice to quit i he turned away in proud and angry sorrow notice but has any one taken the farm inquired phoebe not yet i fancy but he will find no difficulty in letting it the lands lie close to my uncles and i have sometimes thought at all events we have notice but for what reason oh your rich landlord can easily find a reason for ridding himself of a poor tenant the message was civil enough as regarded mother if she had wished to remain in the farm he would have had no objection but as ber request was that the lease might be renewed in my favourite could not comply i was unfit for a farmer be said never in my business always shooting or coursing or cricketing never at home never attending to the main chance unthrifty in everything and about he heard and then suddenly maurice elliott checked himself and paused about to marry a poor girl without a farthing when you might have married your cousin harriet with more money than i know how to reckon oh maurice maurice little did i think when your own dear mother gave her consent because i was active and industrious and an honest mans daughter and because the son she loved so well loved me little did i think that she would be turned from her home for that great goodness but it must not be dear maurice we must part we must not marry to have your mother turned out of doors </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> doors neither of us would be happy so i can speak to my mistress she is so very kind and go to live with her friends a great way off and you will give up coursing and shooting you know you have promised me to do that and then when colonel lisle finds that your heart is in your business all will go right and you will stay at the linden farm and we shall be happy and by way of earnest of this coming felicity poor phoebe burst into a violent fit of sobbing maurice exhausted himself in protestations to do him justice most sincere of love everlasting love to phoebe and hatred equally durable and equally sincere towards uncle cousin landlord and in short all who sought to separate him from his beloved assuring her that colonel lisle s whole estate would not bribe him to renounce his engagement that go where she might he would follow and that so far from desiring to coutiiiue at their old home nothing would induce him to remain the tenant of a landlord so unjust and despotic one who had condemned without hearing the descendant of a race who had lived under his father and his fathers fathers ay even fiom the planting of the great limetrees which gave their name to the farm but if maurice was vehement phoebe whose hysterical sobbing had ended in quiet and relieving tears continued gently firm you would not make me wretched maurice i know that you would not and how could i be otherwise if i were to cause you ruin i shall go into kent to mrs holdens sister and colonel lisle will think better than to dismiss the son of his old tenant go to him dear maurice speak to him yourself explain vol iii c go to him indeed speak to him explain i can tell you phoebe that he must come to me if he wishes me to stay upon his land there are other farms in the county beside his we are no bondslaves blessed be god in merry england but dont you go phoebe stay and let me tell you of my plans or if you must go promise at least to see me and to give me a full hearing before you leave hilton promise me this stay at least till this ploughingmatch is over that will be a holiday far and near see me then and i will let this dear hand go and phoebe blushing sighing and protesting against a meeting which would only be a renewal of pain did however give the required promise and the lovers parted she for her indoor duties he for the home he was soon to relinquish they who witness those pretty rural festivals with all their picturesque accessories of tent and marquee banners and bands gay and happy crowds shaded by noble trees and lighted by bright sunshine and fanned by the sweet airs of the fairest of the seasons or they who read the elaborate account of the days proceedings in the county newspapers where all is chronicled en couleur de rose fioni the earliest procession to the latest cheer little guess the trouble and turmoil and tracasseries which this apparently most amicable and peaceful celebration occasions in its district the ostensible competitors whose province is to contend for the prizes are for the most part the winners being satisfied of course and the losers soothed and comforted by encouraging speeches and a good dinner solid pudding added to empty praise as goodhumoured and contented as heart can desire their unlucky patrons and protectors the association in its own proper person having pre 2 piously gone through as much fussing and disputing squabbling and quarrelling as would carry a candidate through a county election or produce a tragedy upon the boards of a theatreroyal one committeeman threatened to resign because he was not a vicepresident and one vicepresident did send in his resignation because he was not the president one very great man an earl applied to to assume that high oflqce never answered the secretarys letter and another great man a viscount coquetted and cooled and showed and finally declined because the earl had been written to first the committee had five meets kings to consider of the place where they ought to meet four to consider of the day of celebration three of the hour of dinner and the grand question of in doors or out of doors marquee or barn very nearly caused a dissolution of the society party having run so high that two of the members after scolding themselves hoarse arrived at that state of dumb resentment which au sewers to the white heat of the anvil and did not speak they quarrelled about the value of the clothes about the devices of the banners about the colours of the cockades in short there was nothing which admitted of two opinions about which they did not quarrel so that the chief dignitaries of the association the chairman treasurer and secretary who had endeavoured to add to their several offices that of pacificatorsgeneral declared that all the ploughmen and all their teams would not work half as hard on the day of trial as they had done during the time of preparation but if this spirit of opposition for oppositions sake be a little too much the fashion in our free country where the good yeoman who subscribes his five shillings claims a voice potential as double as the dukes who lays down his twenty pounds and that the facts arc little exaggerated will be readily admitted by most who have been behind the scenes in such societies so let me proudly say the illhumour having once found a vent works itself clear and the rough burly disputants come round again shake hands and hear reason with a readiness and facility just as characteristic of our national manners where a squabble once over is over for ever and a quarrel fairly reconciled only leaves the opponents faster friends than before accordingly by the time the appointed day arrived all was peace and amity and joyous bustle and the scene took its usual cordial and hearty character of a meeting calculated to advance the interests and promote the happiness of all classes some weeks had elapsed since the dialogue between the lovers in farmer holdens barnyard and reports were rife in the village of a strange change in the fortunes of the young tenant of the linden farm his fathers will it was said threw him entirely into the power of his hardhearted and puisseproud uncle stephen elliott there were different versions of the story and no one spoke as of positive knowledge but one fact seemed certain that maurices negociation for a farm of the same extent with that which he now occupied had been cut short by the intervention of his stern relative and that he was now seeking to rent a few acres of pastureland attached to a cottage in the moors he and phoebe had not met but pursuant to her promise she had not left hilton and was now dressing for the ploughingmatch at her mothers cottage with a feeling of lightheartedness for which she would have found it difficult to account was she could she be conscious that her lovers gaze was fixed upon her through the open door or was the knowledge that he was no longer the rich and to use the country phrase the somewhat prodigal young farmer but nearer her own level brightening her eyes and glowing in her cheek with a hope unacknowledged even to her own heart or did she give more credit than she thought she did to the report of her little cousin george that he and his master were after all to try for the prizes at the ploughingmatch phoebe knew that stephen elliott had said with his scornful sneer and bitter tone let him try for the suit of clothes he may want cm and phoebe knew enough of her lovers temper to feel that this very taunt uttered to keep him from the scene was likely to take a different effect upon his high spirit at all events thought she i shall see him and she dressed herself in a flutter of spirits with which vanity had little to do and then sat down quietly to await her father whom she was to accompany and to whom the first prize was allotted as having brought up a large family in credit and respectability without receiving parochial assistance the hale old man in his wellpreserved sunday coat with his grey hair smoothed down over his honest face and his pretty daughter hanging upon ms arm as they walked on the ground after the match was over formed one of the most interesting groups of the day the scene was really beautiful upon an extensive lawn richly </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> richly dotted with magnificent trees and backed by a noble mansion embowered in woods stood a splendid central marquee with smaller tents on either side flags and banners waved round the tents and crowned the lofty decorated building arched with lilacs and labumams where the gentlemen were to dine and the large low open carthouse overhung by a downhanging elm prepared for the ploughmen carnages were driven up in close succession horses prancing music playing and to borrow the words of the county chronicle all the beauty and fashion of the neighbourhood were collected in front of the tents to witness the distribution of the prizes and best of all they who had earned those prizes and sturdy tillers of the soil clean healthy and happy their delighted wives and daughters and the stout yeomen their masters triumphing in the success of their labourers add to this the lucky accident of a sunny day in the most genial of the seasons and every advantage of light and shadow and shifting clouds and the result will be a scene too wide for the painter but rich and bright and joyous as ever inspired a poet in the merry month of may phoebe looked only for one figure and there dressed like the rest of the competitors in a white smockfrock his head decked with a double cockade as winter not only of the regular match but of a subsequent prize for ploughing with two horses stood maurice elliott and close beside him her little cousin george sticking his hat also doubly cockaded as high as possible upon his head and fairly standing on tiptoe that his honours might be more conspicuous inear him so placed as to appear to belong rather to the gentry than to the wealthy yeomen in which order he was really classed leaned his uncle stephen his accustomed scornful sneer darkened as if by stronger passions the ceremony and its attendant speeches being over colonel lisle approached phoebe and her father now also wearing the decorations of the day and joined by little george and patting the boys cheek he said graciously to the old man why you and your nephew are carrying ois all our prizes add his soninlaw if you please sir said maurice elliott approaching the group holding in one hand the hat decked with its blue cockades of success and shaking hands heartily with the greyheaded and venerable old peasant add his soninlaw for such i shall be as soon as the banns can be published for i have no money now to throw away upon a licence all is settled continued he ina lower tone to the old man phoebe consented as soon as ever i proved to her that not only my happiness but my prosperity depended upon my marrying such a wife as herself pooh as soon as i proved that my happiness depended upon my marrying her for there is not such another in the world and joseph clarkson finding that i am to have her to manage the dairy has consented to let me rent his thirty acres domi in the moors and the little homestead belonging to it there s a capital garden and during my spare time i shall raise vegetables for the belford market and mother 11 live nth ns and you 11 see how happy we shall be and happiness danced in the young mans eyes as again wringing the old labourers hand he turned away to join his phoebe stop i exclaimed colonel lisle who irresistibly attracted by the sudden alteration in his tenants manner and conduct had been unable to refrain from listening to the conversation stop one moment maurice elliott said he kindly and tell me what this means i joseph clarksons land in the moors and your mother to live with you there why in leatiig the linden there avill be the stock and the crops and the farming utensils enough whether you retain or dispose of them to set you up in one of the best farms in the county all was left i know to you and your mother surely you have not since your fathers death involved yourself in such a debt as to render this change of situation necessary i owe no man a farthing sir replied maurice with some pride of accent and manner then catching the kindly glance of his landlord he continued mildly and respectfully everything was left to my mother and myself but either by accident or design i believe i am sure by accident the will is so worded that although in case of our continuing at the linden farm the stock and property of every sort were to remain for my use upon paying a small annuity to my mother yet if we removed it appears that the whole is to be sold the money to be invested in the 3 per cents and not to be touched either by her or me until her death neither of lis receiving any benefit from this sum beyond the yearly payment of her annuity which heaven grant may continue for many years this is new to me maurice and strange as well as new who is the executor mr stephen elliott my uncle humph your uncle have you seen the will has any lawyer seen it your uncle mr stephen elliott is the executor you say is the will in your fathers hand writing iso sir in that of mr ball the little pettifogging lawyer of bewley a man thirty miles off stephen elliotts factotum i thought so well we must get some one learned in the law to look over it istot to touch the money till after your mothers death that could never have been the design of the testator however well it might meet the views of this must be looked to maurice send me a copy of the will you are very good sir replied maurice firmly but with all gratitude for you kindness i have made up my mind to let the matter rest firmly as i believe that my father did not contemplate this state of things that he never dreamt of oiu leaving the linden farm it is nevertheless so set down and there is something in contesting the last will of a parent which i cannot endure besides we shall do very well my mother will have the comforts to which she has been accustomed if my labour can provide them and it will be better for me to bea workingman i was getting to like sporting better than farming phoebe said so sii as well as you but now all that is out of the question i can work as i have proved to her and with her for a companion and a reward i shall be a happier man at the moors than i should have been in our old house well as i love it better and happier perhaps than you might have been had this not occurred replied colonel lisle grasping his young tenants hand with a pressure full of heart but not better or happier than you will be there now the new lease shall be made out tomorrow your uncle for views of his own and in revenge for your refusal of his daughter represented you tome as dissipated idle extravagant and careless of all except the caprice of the hour he even contrived to turn your love for phoebe into a proof of the lowness of your mind and degradation of your habits under this view i sent the notice fully intending however especially after i found that he wanted the farm to examine vol iii d more closely into the facts i ought to have looked into the matter at once but i can hardly regret not hasting done so since the experiment has not only made your character better known to me but to yourself and noah you must introduce me to phoebe there she stands looking at us no now that she sees that weare looking at her she turns away blushing but that is phoebe i should know the fresh innocent smile among a thousand and as a lover of all justice even that shadowy justice called poetical which is the branch over which we poor authors have most control i must add that whilst phoebes smiles giew sweeter and sweeter as her blushes deepened stephen elliott the rich and purseproud uncle who had crept stealthily within hearing of the conversation and felt himself detected and defeated slunk away hanging down this head pale with impotent malice and muttering ineffectual curses the most contemned and miserable wretch of that large assembly d 2 ts this our foemans face ah no no no shakspeare a fairer damsel never graced the pinched coif and demure kerchief of the puritans than mabel goodwin as she stood one sultry afternoon in the deity month of june </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> june wreathing a straggling honeysuckle round a mossy sundial in the deseited pleasaunce of temple waltham the scene of its accessories were not unworthy of the blooming maiden a very rosebud for beauty and youthfulness whose swift and airy motions seemed to throw light and sunshine over the picture and yet there was a strange contrast between her bright and beaming loveliness and the neglect and desolation of all around the magnificent mansion one of the spacious and picturesque manor houses of elizabeths days erected as the name would import upon the site of a still more extensive residence or preceptory of the proud order of st john of jerusalem had been shut up since the establishment of the commonwealth its former possessor sir philip llontresor a staunch old cavalier having been in exile since the star of cromwell had been in the ascendant and colonel goodwin in virtue of a decree of the committee of sequestration its present owner a plain soldier and a zealous roundhead rigid selfdenying and averse from luxury as the protector himself preferring the humble dwelling of his forefathers the home of his boyhood to the splendid abode of the royal favourite desolated it was with its barred windows its silent courts the grass growing on its noble terraces the statues and urns that crowned the marble balustrades broken and overthrown nettles and briars forcing their way between the broad flights of steps wallflowers and snapdragons flourishing in every nook of the richly carved stone mullions desolation triumphed over all and yet so picturesque was the building with its elaborate variety of outline its pointed roofs and gable ends and clustered chimneys its turrets and porches and pinnacles its deep bay windows and projecting oriels the play of light and shadow and the mellow tinting of the weatherstained walls and it is doubtful if a painters eye would not have found more gratification in contemplating the mansion silent and deserted as it was a model of the poetical architecture of an age when that grandest of the arts had not yet subsided into dull prose than to have gazed on its spacious courts crowded with knight and squire groom and page with stately dames and mincing damsels on that day for ever memorable in the annals of the montresors when the virgin queen in one of her progresses deigned not only to sleep a night at temple laleham but even to dance a coranto with its master if the hall were still fair to the sight the park or rather chase in which it stood presented a scene of unrivalled beauty clumps of oaks and beeches old enough to have witnessed the stern and warlike exercises and to have listened to the choral hymns of the knights templar an avenue of elms above a mile in length pillared and arched like the aisle of some mighty cathedral thickets of old thorns covered with pearly blossoms mingled with the paler foliage of the feathery birch rising from an undergrowth of fern amongst which the deer were lying in scattered groups whilst large herds were grazing upon the rich herbage approaching close to the mansion as conscious that they had little to fear from the intrusion of man a piece of water that might almost be called a lake piercing the depth of the woods and giving back in its bright mirror the rich and varied forest scenery and the light and fleecy cloudlets of the summer sky a ruined tower on an eminence upon the other side of the mere whose walls covered with ivy were said to have belonged to a watchtower in the days of the preceptory and nearer the house some broken ground part of which had been fishponds now filled up with a growth of alders and other moistureloving trees whilst under a steep declivity appeared the low arch of a deserted grotto half covered with pendent plants all this set off br the strong light and shadow of a sunny day in june formed a picture of no common interest and beauty the pleasaunce too with its rosebushes and other flowering shrubs tuned into actual trees bending under the weight of their blossoms and the formal parterres thanks to mabels love of gardening bright with pinks and sweetwilliams larkheels so fletcher hath it marigolds and gillies the pleasaunce exhibited a strange mixture of gaiety and desolation the sparkling fountain whose waters shimmering in the sunshine glittered like showers of diamonds no longer cooled and refreshed the noontide air that light was extinguished those streams had ceased to flow even the quaint basin carved like a huge cockle shell such as a few centuries before might have been seen amongst the followers of the knights of the temple denoting the pilgrims from the holy land that shelllike basin whose small reservoir at once supplied and received the slender jets of water which dropped into the shallow pool with a sound so lulling and so musical was broken now and dry even those tain hedges of holly and yew the living walls as smooth as masonry surmounted at regular distances by figures bearing remote resemblances to phoenixes or peacocks dragons or bears or other birds and animals existent or nonexistent those hedges pride of the old gardeners art which sheltered at once the flowerplots from the bleak northeast and the chaste dames of the hall from intrusion or observation had now escaped from the shears broken into a wild luxuriance of vegetation so that the spreading branches and projecting tops had not merely obliterated all traces of their former trim and painful clippings but had by their irregular and disproportioned growth thrown the crowning monsters into inextricable confusion the closely shaven turf was overrun with moss the gravel paths were covered vrith grass and weeds in short at temple laleham nature was every where triumphing over art and amongst the fairest of natures works might be reckoned the blooming rosebud mabel goodwin she had finished her task of twisting the straggling honeysuckle round the old sundial already garlanded with the pink purple flowers of the sweetpea and after gazing earnestly from side to side of that flowery prison the pleasaunce enclosed as it was by its high walls of yew and holly and peeping cautiously in an attitude compounded of looking and listening through an arch cut in the thick hedge which led into the chase after glancing somewhat impatiently up at the old clocktower which still held its stately place amongst the gilded vanes and richly carved pinnacles of the mansion although the machinery had ceased to perform its office and the deep solemn tongue which seemed to convey a warning upon the flight of time as it told the hours had long been mute and casting another fruitless and pettish look at the old sundial which had lost its gnomon and then holding her fair hand so as to shade lier eyes from the glare gazed to somewhat more purpose upon the bright sun whose course in the heavens no neglect of man could stay or change after three several vain attempts to ascertain the hour she turned rapidly round as a slight sound caught her quick ear and was aware of a young man whose simple garb could not conceal the air of high birth and high breeding visible in every motion who had approached by one path as she was watching for him by another and now stood at her side so master arthur montresor exclaimed the fair damsel with the little air of sauciness and coquetry which formed so piquant a contrast with her puritanic attire so this is the way you oversea gallants keep triste with a simple country maiden here have i been for longer than i can tell and but that i despatched old jonathan to the hayfolk in the lilymead with a weighty bottle of double ale and mentioned something about seeking marshmallows to make a salve for daniels leg which he cut half off yestereve poor fellow with his own scythe whilst he was at one and the same time mowing a heavy swathe and listening to a word in season from ebenezer crump but for the excuse of seeking these mallows and the sweet herbs for my fathers pottage how i could have wandered here none can tell and to find you absent one should have thought that the prospect of a dinner would have made you punctual take it cant you continued mabel as she hastily flung the herbs she spoke of mallows sweetmarjoram marigolds and thyme from a basket which lay on the tuif half hidden by a great rosebush and handed to her companion with rather more care a large packet wrapped in a napkin which the loose bundle of mallows had covered most effectually take the packet and off with it to your hiding place master arthur resumed she you have small cause for thanks i trow </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> trow since the pasty was made of your own deer thats certain and tis odds but the flask of canary may in bygone days have inhabited the spacious cellarage of temple laleham leave kissing my hand good arthur and away kay nay rest here a moment fair cousin resumed the pretty damsel whose experience of the oversea gallants delight in her society had been such as to occasion no small surprise at the ready obedience to the command of leaving her which he testified upon the present occasion you mayas well stay just for one moment just to tell me in the first place the cause why you are so silent and so sad and in the next to have an opportunity of profiting by the perusal of a billet which i have received this very morning from my unworthy suitor as he calls himself minas eldest son and heir of aminadab holdfast the elder scrivener of newport a billet from aminadab mabel i and you allow him hear the story out beau cousin a billet in verse have patience and you shall hear all many a long year back before the worst of these bad times when your dear mother lady montresor profited of the very distant kindred that subsisted between our houses to show all manner of kindness in my fathers absence to his motherless girls and to me the youngest more especially for somehow my sister kesiah shrank away from her notice as if anticipating the sad division that was to come well you may remember in those days when you a tall youth and i a small damsel when i used to call you my little wife mabel and my dear mother smiled at the word oh i remember those days well too well perhaps for a penniless exile and the beau cousin sighed fie arthur resumed the fair maiden let me get on with my story well in those days there arrived from foreign parts sent by sir philip from italy was it not a certain instrument which if laid in an open window and swept by the wind would discourse a music as strange as the means by which it was produced so wild and sweet and sad were the sounds i remember as if it were yesterday my poor mothers delight in those long melancholy cadences and the fears of the domestics who even after the simple machinery was shown and explained to them continued to believe it something ominous if not supernatural but what can the soliman harp have to do with aminadaband his billet you shall hear some fortnight since after in one of my halfstolen sits to the temple laleham library and the dear pleasaunce i had discovered you fair cousin and your hidingplace old judith discoursing of signs and omens spoke of the wind music up at the mansion and keg curiosity was much excited so to prevent a visit which might have endan vol itt b gored your secret i ran here the next morning at daybreak and having after a long search discovered the lost treasure carried it home forthwith still what has that to do with aminawab why the sweet youth hast ever seen him arthur hes the very model of a puritan scriveners only son and heir plain precise stiff and slow dropping out his words at the rate of a syllable to a minute and stalking along the highway at a pace which at a liberal computation may average some half mile an hour he is allover an epitome of puritanism and law the new suit in which he comes acourting crackles like parchment and he makes love in a jargon filched from the mortgages and title deeds which that cunning thief his father has stolen from their right owners hath he not your estate at montremor vale yes i i know he hath well arthur you are going to say over again what makes all this to the billet sow the truth is that this accomplished swain happening to see me one fair morning yith a volume of spenser in my hand and knowing from the look of the stanzas that it was verse and scandalized at the title for of all commerce with any queens more especially the faerie queene we may safely hold him guiltless began vituperating the poets and poesy in such a fashion that i thinking to be rid of him forbade him my presence until he had to make amends for his crime of lese poesie produced a copy of verses in my honour and he has written them and these are they quoth master arthur montresor taking them carelessly from mabels fair hand delightfully bad of course added he i crave your pardon they are on the contrary so good that although aminadab e 2 hath engrossed and in some sort appropriated by engrossing them for one cant call those square angular characters hand of writ i should as soon suspect holdfast the elder his honoured father of the composition as himself i dare say he has stolen them as that respectable scrivener would steal an estate its the family trick head them arthur addressed to celia and signed mentor what will the precisian his father say to names so heathenish to an soliman harp addressed to the lady of all beauty the thrice fair celia oh breezy harp that with thy fond complaining hast held my willing ear this whole night long mourning as one might deem yon moon slow waning sole listener oft of thy melodious song sweet harp if hushed awhile that tuneful sorrow which may not flow intermitted still a lovers prayer one strain less sad might borrow of all thou poorest at thine own sweet will now when her forehead inthat pale moon gleaming yon darktressed maid beneath the softening hour as fain to lose no touch of thy sad streaming leans to the night from forth her latticed bower and the low whispering air and thy lone ditty around her heart their mingled spells have wove now cease those notes awhile that plain for pity and wake thy bolder song and ask for love a3iynt0r stolen of a surety none of minas handiwork and with a gravity which mabel was far from expecting he returned the manuscript but wherefore thus amort fair cousin methinks a loveditty from yon starched puritan were no ill cause of mirth not quite stolen although none of my handiwork again sir kenyons kind gift she may laugh the rather that by issuing your commands and accepting his obedience you are doing your best to further his suit think of this dear mabel and put curb and rein on your gay spirit so that it lead you into no straits when your poor cousin arthur montremor is close mewed up and can no longer pester you with grave counsel or listen to the prattle which he has loved too well they have tracked me mabel all day long i have felt that the spy ebenezer the creature of old holdfast is upon my footsteps although by escaping through the wilderness to the pleasaunce walled in by those tall yews and hollies i have for the moment baffled him and what is worse an important missive for my errand here was not merely to see once again my old ancestral mansion the home of my forefathers and to fall in love with the sweet plaything of my early years my own little wife what is far worse they have i fear a missive compromising far higher names than mine even ormond himself hark i that is fideles bark the spies are at hand away with thee dear arthur i they know not the secret of the library window which thou canst reach in a moment nor of the underground passage between the house and the grotto leading from that very room fly thither and leave me to baffle them i away dear arthur be quiet fidele an hour after this dialogue mabel goodwins round and ringing voice was heard in the grotto singing to a popular air the first line of aminadabs loveditty oh breezy harp that with thy fond complaining ought not aminadab to be greatly flattered fidele that i all alone here except thy faithful self my pretty fidele am singing his verses oh breezy harp i wonder whether anybody hears me and gathering fiom her words that she was indeed alone the young cavalier emerged from the subterranean passage into a dark cave beyond the grotto from whence he could if necessary effect an immediate retreat the grotto itself being filled with gardenpots rakes hoes and other light tools which at once formed an excuse for mabels visit and ensured her of warning in case any other person should approach they are gone arthur cried mabel triumphantly they are both gone ebenezer crump and old master holdfast in his proper person half a dozen </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> dozen miles on the way to london by this time and what do you think they have taken with them to lay before the protector guess guess aminaflabs loveditty what think you of that oh breezy harp that with thy fond complaining its a pity they yont know the tune theres your letter the letter mind that you don t drop it again my good friend for one cant expect every day to get a copy of verses from that mirror of puritans to send in the stead how did i manage do you want to know why ebenezer had the letter in his hand girdled round with a bit of red silk and secured by a seal and while master holdfast was examining the herbs in my basket luckily you had taken the wine and pasty with you i begged to look at the packet pretending to admire the gloss silk and the seal by which it was fastened and so slipped the letter out and the verses in to think how his highness the protector will stare to see an address to the lady of all beauty signed mentor and master holdfast when he shall recognise the hand of writ of aminadab oh breezy harp it is really worth the fright to think how delightfully theyll be puzzled but then to look arthur on your grave face i do verily believe you would that this missive of yours with all its treason against the lord protector had gone to whitehall rather than that song not so dearest mabel your quick wit and ready hand have saved my life and the lives of others far more valuable than mine but at a risk to yourself when the change of letters is known as known it must be right speedily at a risk to your own happiness which i tremble to think of as for me i must avail myself of the respite afforded me to prepare the means of escape thou fairest and dearest he checked himself and continued in a lower tone were it too much to ask of thee to meet me here three nights hence by that time he again paused 4hou wilt not fear to trust thyself here at midnight thou wilt not mistrust thy poor cousin thou wilt come hither sweetest mabel i must go now at any rate said the little damsel blushing my father is ill at ease and may lack my presence and strict though he be and demure as is my good sister kesiah i do firmly believe that he albeit he calls me rattlebrain and madcap and chides my vagaries a dozen times a day doth in reality and in the bottom of his heart love me a hundredfold better than he does her a fair afternoon to you master arthur montresor what would you give now to see the lord protectors face when lie opens aminadabs loveditty oh breezy harp and off the gipsy tripped the third night arrived a true english summer night the west wind sighing the moon nearly at full labouring through drifting clouds at one moment illumining the silent mansion and the noble park at another enveloping all around in the deepest shadow the youth and maiden stood within the ruined grotto mabel wrapping herself in her hood and scarf but shivering nevertheless partly from the effect of the night dew partly from strong emotion for the cousins why not use the true word and call them lovers seemed to have changed characters so earnest and ardent were his pleadings and her replies so grave and sad and yet perhaps the transition from extraordinary gaiety to silent depression is more common than it seems both extremes of manner and of feeling belong to the same sensitive temperament the same chameleonlike power of reflecting with equal intensity the brightest sunshine and the darkest shade much as poor mabels pet lady montresors old peacock which reflected the noontide light so brilliantly seeming to throw off showers of gold and coloured gems as it waved its glittering plumage sat now perched upon the low bough of one of the great linden trees dusky dark and shadowy as night herself of such slight wear is gaiety in this changeful world cheerfulness stands the test better that may be likened to mabels other feathered friend the brooding swan who sits half hidden by sedges upon her nest in yonder islet carrying the serene beauty of her snowy plumage into the gloomiest recesses making a sunshine in the shady place rejoicing in her pure and silvery whiteness from moonless midnight to matin prime but we must return to our lovers all has befallen as i predicted mabel without exactly knowing that for which it was a substitute the trick of the loveditty has been detected and my presence here so far ascertained as to ensure tomorrows bringing spies and soldiers horse and foot upon the track to ransack this old place aided by the local knowledge of the scrivener holdfast eager to rid himself of me that he may retain unquestioned possession of montresor yale the northern property of our old house thrice eager to obtain thy hand for the formal precisian his son that he may join these goodly manors to the estates that he already calls his and thou ay my sentence is already passed i must wed aminadab or relinquish all hope of pardon from my father and poor mabels tears poured down like rain wed aminadab and embrace misery for thy whole life long ko sweetest mabel that must never be dearest when sent to england by charles himself joined in his honouring confidence with that soul of honour ormond and brought by the duties of my mission near to our old home i fancied that it was only the love of the pleasant scene where i had passed my happy youth that brought me to temple laleham and chained me there desperate was that selfdeception mabel i came here that i might see once again the lovely child the remembrance of whose graces had steeled my heart against the fair dames of france and italy i remained here because i found that lovely child ripened into lovelier woman and for the first and only time i felt that i loved the poor exile dared not woo the rich heiress and i was silent but now oh mabel i cannot leave thee to the destiny with which thou art threatened come with me fairest dearest the prospects of the cavaliers are brightening a mightier conqueror death himself is wrestling with the great warrior who hath sat so firmly i had well nigh said so worthily on the english throne his son cannot fill that seat and then but even if that hope fail and we be still poor my mabel i think not of riches they are as dust in the balance my father arthur my poor poor father will he be happier thinkst thou to see thee wretched with one whom thou canst not love and to feel and know that he caused that wretchedness come sweetest the horses wait he kissed me tonight and blessed me laid his hand upon my head and blessed me arthur iy dear dear father i cannot leave him arthur i and she wrung her hands and sobbed as if her heart would break wilt thou stay to wed aminadab we shall return mabel to thy father return to kneel together for his blessing and he has still kesiah here is thy palfrey place that little foot in my hand so my father my poor father and weeping and exclaiming she rode away a twelvemonth had gone by the summer sun shone once more on the fair mansion and the rich woods of temple laleham the great protector was dead and eichard cromwell had seemed as well pleased to relinquish the task of sove vol iii f reign as charles had been to ascend his ancestral throne the kingdom after its long unrest was beginning to settle into tranquillity when one fine morning the offending daughter now by the death of stout sir philip lady montresor stood humbly before her fathers door kesiah received her there with the kiss of sisterly affection my father my dear father said poor mabel he is better much replied kesiah answering the look rather than the word greatly better in health and prepared to see you the sisters sought his room in silence and mabel fell weeping at his feet and laid her head upon his knee father dear father and again she wept softened by illness by the sight of his favourite child and above all by her fondness and humility the old man once again laid his trembling hand upon her head smiling through her tears she received the benediction in joyful silence thou hast a son mabel what hast thou called the varlet john goodwin dear father john goodwin </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> goodwin poor silly wench and i would not suffer kesiah to name him in my presence john goodwin poor wench poor wench they tell me mabel that thy husband is as silly as thyself that he hath been striving in the council against his own rights and contenting himself with winning back his estate of montresor yale from his old enemy holdfast hath caused the mansion and lands of temple laleham to abide with me well well thou must dwell there mabel and so must he and the young knave thy son nay father is there not room for you and kesiah also room for us all let us not be parted again dear father never let us be parted again and at temple laleham the reconciled family father and children roundhead and cavalier dwelt to a good old age in peace and honour i have no joy of this contract tonight shakspeare what not a word to thy poor old nurse or thy faithful bowerwomen not a nod or a smile or a kindly look to show that thou eldest us thou that wast wont to be the merriest and kindliest damsel in merry cumberland the fair and bold edith clifford the wealthiest maiden north of trent about to be wedded too to the young lord howard the goodliest and the bravest knight of xing heys court for whose favour the gay dames of the south have been trying and viewing at pageant at joust and at tournament ever since his return from the wars men say that for all that he hath fought against the soldan and carried the blanchelions the old banner of his house foremost among the proud chivalry of france and italy he hath rather the mien of a young page than of a stalwart warrior so smooth and fair is his brow so graceful his form so gentle and courteous his bearing still amort sweeting mute as a marble image on thy very bridal eve p and the good old margaret seeing her lady still unmoved paused for very vexation so generous a wooer too exclaimed one of the attendant maidens glancing at the profusion of rich gifts with which a heavy wain had been laden and which had arrived that very day at the castle under convoy of the good knights squire and a score or two of pages and menatarms and which now lay in magnificent profusion about the tapestried chamber scattered amidst the quaint antique furniture highbacked ebony chairs oaken screens cut into mimic lacework marble slabs resting on gilded griffins or some such picturesque monsters of heraldry and huge cabinets composed of the rarest woods an entire history profane or sacred carved upon the doors and surmounted with spires and pinnacles like the decorated shrine of a gothic cathedraal the whole scene lighted up by the bright beams of the evening sun coloured into a thousand vivid hues as they glanced through the storied panes of the oriel window a scene more bright or more gorgeous than that stately ladys bower tenanted as it was by woman in her fairest forms by venerable age and blooming youth could hardly be found in merry england yet there sat the youthful lady of the castle in the midst of all this costly beauty languid and listless pale and motionless as a statue so generous a wooer too exclaimed mistress bridget the pretty bright eyed brunette the lady ediths principal bowerwoman who being reckoned the best adjuster of a headtire and the most skilful professor of all arts of the loom and the needle whether in whiteseam cutwork tapestry or broidery of any maiden in the north country was more especially alive to the rarity and richness of lord howards gifts so generous a wooer too only look at these carpets from persia tis a marvel how folk can have the heart to put foot on such bright flowers they seem as if they were growing and these velvets from genoa were ever such colours seen and the silken stuffs from padua that stand on end with their own richness what kirtles and mantles they dll make and the gloves of cales that cause the chamber to smell like a garden full of spice cloves and jessamine and these veils from the low countries as fine as a spiders web and the cloth of gold and the cloth of silver where did master eustace say they came from dame margaret and this golden vessel for perfumes which looks like a basket all overrun with grapes and ivy that was wrought by a cunning goldsmith of florence responded old margaret whose skill is so surpassing that albeit he employs chiefly the precious metals the workmanship is of more value than the materials this silver tray with the delicate trelliswork wreathed with lilies and roses round the edge and the story of diana and ac ac fie on my old brains i shall forget my own name soon diana and he that was turned into a stag actaeon whispered alice the fairest and most youthful of the lady ediths attendants gently and unostentatiously supplying the good dames failure of memory without looking up from her work ay actaeon i thank thee alice thy wits are younger than mine by fifty good years or more this silver salver with the light delicate edge that seems like the work of the fairies and the story of diana and actaeon inside is by the same hand and then the caskets of precious stones pursued the enthusiastic waiting damsel warming at the contemplation of the finery the brooches and bracelets the coronets and the castanets why yonder wreath of emeralds and amethysts which lies on the table underneath the great venetian glass to think of my lady never having had the curiosity to look into that / and mistress bridget took a selfsatisfied peep at her own pretty figure as it was reflected on the broad clear surface of the rare and costly mirror that single wreath which she hath never vouchsafed to glance upon and the ropes of pearls which i laid upon her lap and which she hath let drop upon the floor do pick them up alice i verily believe the foolish wench caret as little for these precious adornments as the lady edith herself that one wreath and those strings of pearls be worth an earls ransom at this moment the sound of a harp was heard and the voice of the minstrel arose from beneath the casement waken to pleasure lady sweet i lo an empires treasure is spread at thy feet here be shawls of cashmere fine rubies from bulgarias mine the pearshaped pearls of ormuz bay and gold mid yemens sands that lay waken to pleasure lady sweet love and loves treasure be spread at thy feet the air was smooth and flowing and the voice that of eobert fitsstephen one of the most approved of the courtly minstrels but still the lady edith sat pale and motionless as though the tide of melody had glided unfelt over her senses producing no more impression than the waters of the lake upon the plumage of the cygnet dame margaret sighed deeply and bridget giving her head a provoked impatient jerk resumed her embroidery with such furious rapidity that she broke her silk halfadozen times in the course of a minute and well nigh spoiled the carnation upon which she was engaged and which she had intended to outvie the natural blossom in father franciss flowerborder young alice drawing her nearer to them and further from lady edith and speaking in a low tone even lower than her own soft and gentle natural voice resumed the conversation for my own part good bridget call me foolish an thou wilt i do not wonder at our sweet ladys sadness think what a piteous thing it is to be an orphan think but of that great grief and then to be a great heiress to boot left in the kings ward and dragged from her own dear home in her old dear north countries to this fine grand castle which albeit her own also in right of her lady mother seems too strange and too grand for happiness and all for the purpose of being wedded to this young lord with his costly glittering gifts who had never vouchsafed to come near her until now on the very eve of the bridal when it hath pleased him to give notice of his approach holy st agatha defend me from such a wooer a wooer whose actions shew as plainly as words could tell that he seeketh lady ediths broad lands and caret as little for the lady ediths warm heart as i do for a withered roseleaf ill tell thee what bridget i never look to see such happy days again as when we dwelt in our old dear home amongst the pleasant vales and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> and breezy mountains of cumberland there was health and freedom in the very air dost thou not remember the day when old geoffrey the falconer had lamed himself among the rocks and the youth albert the travelling minstrel took charge of the hawks and waited on my lady as if he had been trained to the sport all his lifelong hast thou forgot how she stood by the lake tli her favourite merlin on her wrist and her white greyhound lillybell at her side looking like the very goddess of the chase so full of life and spirit and cheeriness and that bright evening when she led the dance at the maypole well aday poor lady tis a woful change it was remarkable that the lady ediths attention which neither the louder speech of her elder attendants nor the ringing tones of the harper had been able to command was arrested at once by the soft low voice of alice the womanly sympathy sank soothingly into the womans heart just as the gentle rain from heaven penetrates the parched hillside from whose arid surface the sharp and arrowy hail rebounds svdthout impression the drooping mistress listened in mournful silence whilst her faithful maiden unconscious that she had attracted her notice piusued in still lover accents the train of thought which her own fond recollections of the freedom and happiness which they had tasted among their native mountains had awakened in her mind poor albert too the wandering minstrel who came to the castle gate to crave lodging for one night and sojourned with us for three long months and then when he had wrought himself up to go and verily it was a parting like that of the spirit and the flesh when he left oiu old walls returned again and again and finally fixed himself in the fishermans cottage where the mountain streamlet after meandering along the meadow falls into the lake poor albert i warrant me he taketh good care of lilybell and my ladys merlin whereof he craved the charge from old geoffrey i marvel whether my lady knoweth that her pretty lilybell and her favourite falcon be in hands that will tend them so heedfully for her dear sake to my fancy bridget that poor youth albeit so fearful and so ashamed in her presence worshipped the very ground that she trod upon i have seen him kiss lilybells glossy head after her hand had patted it reverently and devotedly as though it had been a holy relique in the great minster at durham again the full and ringing chords of the harp but this time to an old border air well knoyn to the northern maidens rose from beneath the casement the voice too was different from that of the courtly minstrel deeper manlier pouring forth the spirit of the words as they gushed spontaneously as it seemed from his lips as though in his case song were but the medium of feeling and the poets fancy and the musicians skill were merged vol iii grin the passionate grief of the despairing lover so the strain rang high oer the barons castle tall rich banners float with heavy fall and light and song in mingling tide pour forth to hail the lovely bride yet lady still the birchen tree waves oer the cottage on the lea the babbling stream runs bright and fair the love star of the west shines there ha exclaimed old margaret that ditty hath aroused my lady see how she listens tis the roundelay which she herself was wont to sing observed bridget but the words are different peace peace cried the lady edith checking with some impatience the prattle of her attendants and leaning against the casement which she had flung open as the deep and earnest voice of the minstrel again resounded through the apartment be silent i pray ye mailed wardens pace oer keep and tower gay maidens deck the ladys bower page squire and knight a princely train wait duteous to her bridle rein yet in that cot the milkwhite hound the favourite falcon still are found and one more fond more true than they bon to adore and to obey alack alack sighed the tenderhearted alice welladay poor youth i ever deemed that his strange fondness for lilybell albeit as pretty and playful a creature as ever gambolled on the greensward and as swift of foot as ever followed hare over the mountains had a deeper source than love of the good hound welladay poor albert he was a goodly youth hush hush exclaimed the lady edith as the symphony finished and the voice again mingled ayith the chords of the harp struck falteringly and unsteadily now as though the hand trembled and the heart waxed faint the coronet of jewels rare sh inesproudly oer her face so fair and titles high and higher name lord howards lovely bride may claim and yet the wreath of hawthorn bough once lighter pressed that snowy brow and hearts thatwither now were gay when she was but the queen of may alas alas my lady my dear sweet lady murmured alice to herself as poor edith after lingering at the window long enough to ascertain that the harp was silent and the harper gone sank into a seat with a sigh and a look of desolation that proved more plainly than words the truth of the last lines of the minstrels lay alas alas dear lady exclaimed she in a louder tone as the sudden burst of startling noises the warlike blasts of trump and cornet the jarring dissonant sound caused by raising the heavy portcullis and lowering the massive drawbridge and the echoing tramp of barbed steeds and mailed horsemen in the courts of the castle showed that the expected bridegroom had at length arrived edith wrung her hands in desperation this knight i cannot and i will not see go to him margaret say that i am sick that i am dying the blessed saints can bear witness that thou wilt say but the truth in so telling him sick at heart am i sick to the death oh that i had died before this wretched hour and poor edith burst into an agony of tears that shook her very frame why goes thou not margaret inquired she a few moments after when exhausted its own violence her grief had become more tranquil why dost thou not carry my message to the lord howard why dally thus old dame bridget go thou they stand about me as though i were an ignorant child that knew not what she said do my bidding on the instant bridget thou wert best nay good my lady but our gracious lord the king tell me not of kings maiden ill to sanctuary ill fly this very night to my aunt the prioress of st marys the church knoweth well how to protect her votaries woe is me that for being born a rich heir i must be shut from the free breath of heaven the living waters and the flowery vales in the dark and gloomy cloister to change the locks that float upon the breeze for the dismal veil to waste my youth in the cold and narrow convent cell a living tomb i oh it is a sad and a weary lot but better so than to plight my troth to one whom i have never seen and can never love to give my hand to one man whilst my heart abideth with another lady cried margaret do my senses play me false or is it edith clifford that speaketh tins of a lowbon churl a lowbon churl i responded edith there is a regality of mind and of spirit about that youth which needed neither wealth nor lineage to even him with the greatest the inborn nobility of virtue and of genius xever till now knew i that he loved me and now hasten to this lord alice and see that he cometh not hither wherefore interest thou maiden inquired edith of the pitying damsel who staid her steps with an exclamation of surprise as the door of the chamber was gently opened tell the lord howard the very truth men say that he is good and wise too wise too good to seek his own happiness at the expense of a poor maidens misery tell him the whole truth alice spare thy mistress that shame say that i love him not say that i love iay sweetest lady from thine own dear lips must come that sweet confession said a voice at her side and turning to the wellknown accents edith saw at her feet him who having won her heart as the wandering minstrel the humble falconer claimed her hand as the rich and highborn philip howard the favourite of the king a cry of joy burst from the astonished waitingwomen and was echoed by </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> by the pretty greyhound lilybell who had followed the lord howard into the room and now stood trembling with ecstacy before her fair mistress resting her head in her lap and looking up into her face with eyes beaming with affectionate gladness eyes that literally glowed with delight never was happiness more perfect than that of the betrothed maiden on this so dreaded bridal eve and heartily did her faithful attendants sympathize in her happiness only bridget found it impossible to comprehend why in the hoi of hope and joy as in that of fear and sorrow her dearly beloved finery should be neglected to think quoth the provoked bowerwoman that now that all these marvels have come about and that the lord howard turns out to be none other than the youth albert my lady will not vouchsafe to tell me whether her kirtle shall be of cloth of gold or cloth of silver or whether she will don the coronet of rubies or the emerald wreath welladay i quoth bridget this love i this love they have all been touched and found base metal shakspeare so this is my return to my native village this my reception from relatives who owe me so much thus thought rather than said a poorlooking old man as he stood leaning over the gate of a newlycleared wheatfield in the bright bustling busy harvest time one exclaimed he as his musings took a tone of passion which broke unconsciously into words one yonder portly landlady forsooth sitting in her bar as she is pleased to call it her bar quotha i in my young days it was the little boarded parlour opening from the taproom a bar in the old eed lion what shall we hear of next one bedecked and bedizened with her gown like a rainbow her fringed apron and her cap stuck out with flowers sitting in her bar if that be its style and title amongst her glasses and punchbowls with a bell upon her table and a net of lemons dangling above her head she miss collins as she calls herself she used to answer to the name of jenny collins twenty years agone refused pointblank to acknowledge me i denied to my face that she had ever seen me called me a cheat and an impostor wondered at my impudence in attempting to pass myself for her dear uncle michael xorris threatened me with the stocks and the roundhouse the justice and the jail precious minx she whom i rescued from drudgery and starvation from living half shopwoman half maid with the stingy termagant clear starcher in belford marsh whom i set up in that very eed lion perched upon her throne the armchair in the bar purchased the lease the furniture the goodwill paid her first years rent stocked her cellars clapped a hundredpound banknote into her hand and now that i come home old and lame sick and ragged she reviles me as a vagabond and an impostor and tells me to be thankful to her compassion and tenderheartedness that she does not send for the constable to carry me to jail liar that she is base ungrateful perjured liar for she knew me i saw that she knew me ay as well as i knew her she would be glad to be no more altered in the years that have changed her from a slim girl of twentyfive to a bloated woman of fiveandforty than i in those same years nth all my griefs then her brother faugh it maddens one to think of their baseness her brother whom i educated and apprenticed finding him money afterwards to put him into partnership with old jones the thriving linendraper he indeed did not pretend to deny that i might be his uncle but grant that i were what claim had i upon his charity more than any other starving wretch what was i to him he pitied me heaven knew i but what could i expect from him oh the smoothspeaking softspoken knave with his pity and his charity hypocrite in look and word his tone was as gentle as if he had been bidding me welcome to bed and board for my whole life long what a fawning parasite that would have been now if i had accosted him like a rich man well there is soma virtue in these rags since they teach false tongues to speak truth then came my cousin anthony whose daughter i portioned whose runaway son i clothed and sent to sea and this anthony is now a great malian a rich miser who could buy up half the county what said he why he was poor himself the scoundrel nobody knew how poor and had been forced to make a rule to give nothing to beggars ay he called me a beggar i might go to the union he said that was the fittest place for me to the union the workhouse oh the precious rascal the son of my fathers brother brought up in my fathers house worth a hundred thousand pounds and would have sent me to the workhouse me his only living kinsman oh this world this world then for i was resolved to try them all i sought out my old schoolfellow nicholas hume the spendthrift whom i bailed in my young days when little richer than himself and saved from prison by paying his debts what was his gratitude why he forsooth had never heard my name michael xorris who was michael morris oh they knew me well enough twenty years ago when i returned from the west indies a rich man husband of a wealthy creole master of flourishing plantations to visit my early haunts help my poor relations i found them all in distress some way or other and shake hands with my old friends nobody had forgotten me then but now that i come back a ragged cripple houseless and friendless and the old man paused and lifted his wretched hat from his thin grey hairs and passed his tattered handkerchief over his furrowed brow with an air which proved that he was as much oppressed by mental suffering by indignation and disappointment as by the sultry heat of an august noon there are none left now thought old michael to himself as exhausted by his vehemence he sank into a milder mood none left for me to apply to now except the three orphan children of my poor nephew william leslie the cousin of these hardhearted collins and their mother and they i fear are themselves in great want and great trouble he lately dead after a series of undeserved misfortunes and a long and wasting illness and she working as hard as ever woman did work to keep herself and her family out of the workhouse that union to whose comforts my precious cousin anthony so tenderly consigns me poor things they may well deny any knowledge of me for they never saw me and i have had a good sample of the slight impression that benefits conferred leave behind them william was only eighteen when i left england and returned to jamaica after my last visit a fine frankhearted lad lie was i remember wishing to take him with me but my poor sister would not part with him she had married again after the death of her first husband williams father and a wretched match she made for this second husband proved to be an habitual drunkard always half mad when intoxicated who broke out at last into desperate frenzy and but for my interposition would have murdered the poor boy i seem to see the struggle now thought the old man closing his eyes he fringing himself upon william with a tableknife and i rushing between them just soon enough to receive the blade in my arm i bear the mark of the wound still the madman was sent to an asylum and there soon died and my poor sister well off for her station could not part from this only son he was a fine lad was william spirited and generous and when she also vol iii h lied he was already attached to the girl whom he afterwards married i helped them too for i loved the boy i helped on that match for it was one of sincere affection and they were in a way to earn a handsome competence there must have been some imprudence or great ill luck to have reduced them to such poverty so ran the train of the old cripples reverie i never suspected it he never wrote tome and i engaged in my own affairs and with children then of my own well i will see them however they are in this field gleaning so said their neighbour yes this is the field there they are ill see them thought michael norris though it </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> it is probable that they too will know nothing of me and opening the gate the old man limped slowly across the furrows and began gathering the scattered ears of corn in his withered hand we have said the field although after passing the gate which admitted him between the two high hedges that bounded it on the northern side the wide expanse from which the wheat had just been carried assumed the appearance rather of a large open ridge of arable land bordered by the high road and terminated by a distant village than of the small wooded enclosures so common in the midland counties a pretty scene it was as it lay before him bathed in the sunshine and a lovely group was that to which his attention was immediately directed a pale young woman whose regular and beautiful features received additional interest from her close widows cap stood before him holding a fine infant in her arms a very pretty girl of twelve or thirteen was flourishing a tuft of wheatears before the babys eyes smiling herself at the smile she excited while her little brother clung to the h 2 mothers petticoat in momentary fear of two highfed dogs attending a gentleman and lady riding slowly along the road the poor cripple drew back and sat down under a clump of maple and hawthorn gay with the purple wild vetch the white bind weed and the pretty clematis known by the still prettier name of the travellers joy whilst the ridingparty called off their dogs spoke graciously to the child and his mother and passed slowly out of sight as they left her mrs leslie for she it was approached the old man to replace her infant in his cradle niche under the fragrant shade of some overhanging hazelstems just beside his rude seat struck by the evidence of poverty sickness and sorrow afforded by his tattered apparel and his wrinkled yet venerable countenance she took up a pitcher which stood by the cradle and with the kindness which the very poor so often show to each other and a remark upon the heat of the day offered him a small cupful of the milk which formed the contents of the jug he took it with a trembling hand and thanked her with an emotion which our readers will comprehend but which at once surprised and interested its object your name is leslie asked he as after returning the cup with thanks and blessings he made room for her beside him on the thymy bank your name is leslie margaret leslie it is so the wife of william leslie his widow ah me his widow i replied she with a sigh the widowed mother of those children michael added she as the boy came near them take some milk yourself and can a cupful to your sister and bring what wheatears she and you have gathered to my little heap michael echoed the old man your husbands name was william how came you to call his son michael but the name belongs to your family perhaps your father or some favourite brother no replied the widow it was fora different reason a very dear kinsman of my husbands bore that name and in token of love and gratitude to him and in fulfilment of an old promise so our only son was christened i remember muttered the cripple to himself i remember william said that his first boy should bear my name and i think he wrote to that effect after the child was born but the letter must have arrived at that time of misery then rousing himself and turning to the gentle creature whom a feeling of unusual interest still detained at his side he added aloud i do remember now that william leslie had an uncle called michael noms but what peculiar cause of gratitude what cause i interrupted mrs leslie a thousand causes from a mere infant when i have heard my husband say that he gave him the first shilling he ever possessed that kind uncle absent or present was his good genius he insisted upon his being sent to belford school paid himself for masters whom his guardians thought superfluous rescued him from the frantic frenzy of his stepfather saved his life at the utmost peril of his own from the furious assaults of that wretched madman placed him in the papermill which but for the rash speculations of his partner would have been not merely a comfortable income for himself but an affluent provision for his family aod last and dearest kindness when william with his characteristic generosity loved a poor girl the portionless orphan of a naval officer when interested connexions and officious friends all opposed the union did not he from across the wide ocean send himself not merely his approbation of the destined marriage but a portion for the destitute bride i never saw him continued mrs leslie in a lower tone than that which had been dictated by her enthusiastic recollection of her benefactors goodness but night and morning i have prayed for him and night and morning do my poor children join in those prayers and my dear husband amongst his latest words did he pray for the uncle who seemed to have forgotten him asked the old man his voice halfstifled with emotion look margaret added he stripping up his sleeve and showing a deep scar extending diagonally across his left arm this scar was received from the knife with which his furious and ftantic stepfather was pursuing william leslie i am michael xorris you will not disdain to acknowledge the cripple who comes to your door hungry and ragged here too said he taking from his pocket a bundle of papers are characters that you well know tearfully yet joyfully the amihearted and grateful margaret returned the embraces of her venerable kinsman presented her three children to him one by one and replied to his questions as to their change of circumstances it needed few words to tell the story nothing is more rapid than a descent the rolling of a stone down a hill is a true type of falling fortune taking advantage of a long illness with which tilliam leslie was afflicted his partner engaged in desperate speculations they failed the rash speculator absconded and william remained a bankrupt without a friend or resource honest to the last his vife resigned her small settlement to satisfy the creditors his debts being paid he had tried every means of lining and whilst he retained his health had supported his family by the most persevering industry but a fever occasioned by overexertion had come on his constitution impaired by anxiety and labour had been unable to resist the attack and since that period the wife who had been the faithful partner of his cares and his toils had at least so far succeeded as to maintain her children without the assistance of charity whether public or private why not have written to me when this bankruptcy took place inquired the uncle alas dear sir we had before heard of that terrible hurricane in which in which said the old man filling up with stern composure the sudden pause that from a mixture of delicacy and sympathy had arrested margaret leslies words ein which the plantation where resided was laid waste my house levelled with the ground and my wife with four hopeful children in the ruins in striving to rescue them this thigh striking the withered limb with a hazeltwig this thigh was broken i owe my preservation to the gratitude of an emancipated negro but for months for years all life all nature was a blank before me i have sometimes wondered how i could have survived such a blow for what purpose i was spared the doubt was sinful and finds its rebuke its thrice merciful rebuke in this blissful hour you heard then of my losses dear margaret poor william heard of them we were sure that something must have gone amiss from receiving no reply to the letter which announced the birth of our boy and claimed your promise of standing godfather at his christening william did not like to write again upon such an occasion it would have seemed like encroaching upon your too generous spirit but when the news of that awful hurricane arrived and nicholas hume and the collins made inquiries in london and ascertained that your plantation had indeed been amongst those laid waste then your silence was too well explained i heard this sad news first for it arrived during the dreadful illness which preceded my husbands bankruptcy and when he regained so much breathingtime after his own misfortunes as to ask news of you no tidings could be obtained all trace of you seemed lost oh that he had lived to see this day his will be done but oh that </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> that my poor husband had but lived to see once more the kinsman he loved so well the old man pressed her hand in speechless emotion and margaret smiling through hers went on you must live with us dear uncle and we shall wait upon you and work for you and be happy together as happy as we can be without him after all my annie is a good giil oh such a good girl and pretty is she not dear uncle and poor michael your namesake is a boy of a thousand we have had much to be thankful for farmer rogers the overseer whose books my husband kept little michael keeps them now as well the farmer says as his father did supplies us with milk twice a day mrs lascelles the rectors wife employs annie and me constantly in needlework for her large family and if we can but keep our pretty cottage if we can but keep that cottage at whose porch poor william planted the honeysuckle and the china rose and the vine which now half covers the thatch that cottage where we worked and wept together and where he died the death of the righteous if we can but live togetherthere within sight of the turf that covers his dear remains i should ask for nothing better on this side the graves the widows tears flowed afresh and once again the old man pressed her hand is there any doubt of your retaining this beloved habitation dear margaret and does my coming cause that doubt oh no no dear uncle not in the slightest degree the cause of doubt is that we have no lease and that miss collins as she calls herself poor williams cousin wants it for some purpose or other people say with some view of marrying but this is idle talk village gossip yhat is certain is that she wishes to take it and is willing to give two pounds ayear more rent than i now give or can afford to give if our old landlord mr godfrey had stayed he and lady elizabeth had promised that i should remain but the hall and the village and the whole estate are sold and the new lord of the manor is coming this evening hark you may hear the bells ringing even now mr godfrey and lady elizabeth intend staying a few days at the rectory you saw them ride by with their dogs they have promised to speak in my favour to the new landlord they mentioned it even now and the good rector and his excellent lady will second my petition still ee of good cheer margaret even if you should leave your pretty cottage i would wager something the old man checked himself and resumed in an indifferent tone who is the new lord of the manor what is his name the property was purchased by a mr price but he is understood to be an agent and i have not heard the name of the real proprietor who is said to be an elderly gentleman and so rich that he will hardly be tempted to turn an old tenant from her cottage for so trifling an addition of rent nevertheless once again margaret be of good heart reiterated her uncle the tenants are to meet him in the avenue the farmers and their sons on horseback the cottagers women and children on foot ought i to join them i have no shame in honest labour but i do shrink from meeting the scorn of those purseproud kindred who and poor margarets tears fell fast ought i to be there dear uncle 1 will go or stay as you direct go margaret go and fear nothing gather up your treasures the jug whose generous draught was the sweetest i ever quaffed the wheatears and the cradle with its crowing babe blessings on its dear face go boldly i will not shame you by these unseemly rags but will rest awhile under the friendly shade of the hazel while you return home and prepare for the procession be sure that you fail not we shall meet again soon dear ones for the present farewell and something there was about the old man ragged sick and lame as he was that margaret found it impossible to disobey so heartened up she knew not why for many have felt without being able to give the feeling its true name the mingled power of sympathy and appreciation to comfort and to cheer she called about her her blooming children and departed annie and herself bearing the cradle between them and the boy laden with the gleanings of the day the setting sun gleamed brightly between the noble elms that formed the beautiful avenue to cotton hall gilding the rugged branches and turning into pendent emeralds the leaves of the branches which met across the wide carriageroad met and interleaved in a lengthened archway that might well have suggested the vol iii i ricci intricacies of a cathedral aisle in the proudest days of gothic architecture the village bells pealed amain horses pranced flags waved the children of the parishschools strewed the gaudy flowers of early autumn and as the carriage of the new lord of the manor rolled between the ivied lodges to the grey old hall a quaint irregular structure of elizabeths or jamess days with a tame peacock sunning himself on the stone balustrade a large old english spaniel basking on the steps and the tenants in their holiday apparel grouped around the porch an artist whether painter or poet might have envied the accident which produced an arrangement so felicitously picturesque something of this feeling however unperceived or unguessed by herself mingled with the natural emotions of curiosity and interest in our friend margarets bosom as standing humbly apart between her two elder children with her infant in her arms under a large sycamore she gazed around upon the scene and perceived gaily adorned in the extreme of the country fashion the rival candidate for her beloved cottage the buxom landlady of the eed lion surrounded by the unfriendly kindred of her late husband neither margaret nor her william had ever applied for assistance to these people and yet she knew instinctively that some from pride and some from shame felt the silent reproach of her unassisted poverty and her blameless life that all wished her absence and would contribute as far as in them lay to turn her from her home and in spite of the encouraging influence of her latelyknovm kinsmans cheering forebodings her heart sank within her as the door of the carriage was thrown open an elderly gentleman very neatly dressed but pallid emaciated and lame was i 2 assisted by his servants up the two low steps that led to the porch having ascended them with some difficulty he turned round took off his hat bowed with a gracious smile to the assembly and then paused as if in search of some one whom he expected to see the effect of this apparition was a start of surprise and horror from the portly landlady seldom equalled on the stage or off her brother the haberdasher who had just flourished his hat preparatory to leading the general cheer let it fall in dismay looking the curses which his habitual hypocrisy scarce repressed cousin anthony the rich miserable miser smothered a groan and nicholas hume in spite of his consummate impudence fairly stole away what in the meanwhile did our friends in their humble nook under the sycamore little michael danced for joy annie clapped her hands and poor margaret for the tyelltietll time during the last six hours burst into tears tears this time however of unmingled joy mrs leslie margaret my dear niece i cried michael or as we may now call him mr xoitis advancing to meet her to you alone of all my relations now living do i owe any account of my motives for coming amongst you as i have done today with the rest of my kindred i have done for ever but i also owe some explanation to my tenants and future neighbours you all know that i left england about fifty years ago a poor and friendless lad i returned nearly thirty years afterwards with riches honestly obtained the happy husband of a wealthy and excellent woman and the father of four hopeful children i came to cotton found my relations some indigent some comfortably situated did what good i could amongst them and went back to jamaica with the view at some future clay of placing my sons at the head of my plantations in that island and coming home to die in my native village a hurricane passed over the estate where i lived destroying my dwelling my wife my children and almost myself tor many years i was dead to the world but care </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> care had been taken of the large property that remained to me and when by gods mercy i was restored to health mental and bodily i found myself rich indeed so far as money was concerned richer than ever but in the blessed charities of life most poor a childless desolate bereaved old man i knew that a report had gone abroad that i was ruined by the hurricane and i resolved to prove the relations i had left in england by coming amongst them in seeming poverty i have done so and the experiment has answered well and now my dearest niece i need not tell you that the cottage is yours but for the second time today i throw myself upon your charity you will not abandon me because i happen to be rich you will never have the heart to do so you remember your promise that we should eve together and come with those dear childen to brighten and gladden the old hal the pleasant st angling is to see the fish cutwith her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice shakspeare wherefore so sad and silent helen mine was the question of the fair agnes montresor to her fairer cousin the daughter and heir of the lord scope as followed by a goodly retinue of waiting gentlewomen girooms and pages they threaded with a solemn dignity that might have done honour to elder dames the narrow winding woodland path that divided the glassy mere at the side of which they had been flying their falcons from the ample park dotted with noble groups of venerable oaks bathed in the sunshine that surrounded the barons stately mansion of beauempire what hath troubled thee helen that thou fittest on thy jennet as mute as the merlin on thy wrist art thou wroth with thyself for chiding the young lord devereux from thy bridle rein or alack that a knight so lately from the gay court of france should know so little how to construe a fair maidens wishes when her words say one thing and her looks another is that same arthur devereux fallen into thy disgrace for too readily obeying thy behests what aileth thee sweet cousin thou the heir of those broad lands for whose fair grace the champion strives in the lists and the minstrel at the board thou to hang drooping over thy saddle bow as sad as a turtledove that hath lost her mate whilst i thy poor kinswoman and thy very bowermaidens margaret and cicely are as blithe as so many larks fie on thee sweet cousin this wayward humour is flat treason against thy happier destiny betrothed too to the man whom thou best lowest at the kings command and with thy lord and fathers approval why there it is responded the fair helen suddenly reining in her palfrey and turning towards her cousin with an air of desolation that contrasted strongly with the sprightly demeanour of her young kinswoman have i not cause enow for melancholy think st thou to be bestowed by the kings behest upon the lord devereux so that love me or love me not he must needs espouse me and to be the daughter and heir of a wealthy baron into whose ear all men seem bounden to pour false feigning oh that i were as little in debt to fortune as thou art agnes that i might for once hear words of truth and the pretty spoilt child sighed and it may be for i suspect that the sad rogue called human mature played beauties and heiresses the same tricks in the days of bluff king hal as in the reign of our sovereign lady victoria it may be that she really thought she should prefer truth to flattery even from the lips of the lord devereux her cousin smiled with some archness perhaps she perceived or thought she perceived that what the fair heiress really wanted was praise in a newer and more piquant form jstay an thy melancholy have no deeper root than a lovers courtesy sweet coz ill gage my velvet hood against thy broidered wimple that i find thee a medicine hearken helen this brisk october wind is gathering to a tempest the golden leaves of this close beechen alleyare falling about our ears and the clouds gathering above our heads as though the very blessed skies were part and parcel of our council the rain that monisheth us to seek shelter will drive the falconers from their sport by the mere put thy steed to his full pace dearest we must win afore these gallants to the great hall of beauempire and there thou must hide thee behind the warders great carved chair no into sit thee down there as though overwrought by the sport and the riding and fall asleep that were the cunning device and then when the lord devereux espyeth his lady and mistress as he and my varlet philip poynings pass through with their hawks mark an he speak not as soothfastly as if thou wert thy poor penniless kinswoman with no dower but her merry heart instead of the rich heir of the lord scope so said so done the fair cousins rode as for life and death and not only reached the goodly mansion of beauempire before the party from the lake but had plenty of time to adjust the lady helens costume and position so that she should enact the part of sleeping beauty as naturally and becomingly as possible that the attitude was natural she had satisfactory proof after agnes and her waiting woman had retired her old nurse passing accidentally that way haying testified a nurselike anxiety on the score of her catching cold and even evinced some disposition to awaken her byway of averting the danger whilst the good baron her father happening also to cross the hall and seeing his darling as he believed asleep took incredible pains to mitigate his iron tread and stifle as far as possible the jingling of sword and spur lest he should disturb her slumbers in short so admirable was the counterfeit that the only person except those in the secret not taken in was the barons favourite mastiff wolf who looked up in her face with an expression which seemed at once to detect the counterfeit and to wonder like an honest animal as he was what could be the possible motive for such a deceit at last according to agness prediction lord devereux and sir philip poynings entered the hall and after some talk of the falcon flown and the game taken of jesses and lures and a certain beagle called doncelle and a riding palfrey hight lancelot the good knight appeared suddenly to perceive the fair lady who filled so drowsily the warders chair ha thy bonneville said he in alow voice although her eyes were closed helen felt with absolute certainty that lord devereux glanced towards her and she also felt she knew not how that he smiled she looketh well asleep i continued the knight indifferent well resounded his companion in a voice as chilling as his words shes a fair damsel quoth sir philip indifferent fair was the response and hath a light foot in a coranto indifferent hight and a sweet voice in a virelai indifferent nay interrupted the knight thou art a very heretic in the matter of beauty an infidel a pagan thy very blood is frozen that thou speaks thus of one of the fairest maidens of king henrys court if the lady helen be not a beauty where wilt thou find one the damsel is indifferent fair replied the lord devereux quietly but the lady katherine sands hath a finer shape and the lady pierce a prettier foot and for a virelai or a coranto commend me to the brighteyed provencal the burghers wife of lyons beauty

lacks an hour of noon we shall have time to breathe ourselves and ofi the lord devereux marched just soon enough to save his betrothed from the imminent danger of proving her admiration of frank speaking and her severe love of truth by an explosion of tears or of scolding or byr lady by inflicting upon the cheek of her lover such a slap from her fair hand as half a century later was no uncommon act of grace from good </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> good queen bess to her more favoured courtiers poor helen from this risk she was happily saved and when they met at the banquet the recusant had nothing worse to encounter than cold monosyllables and averted eyes the storm still continued to rage without and in spite of his ladyloves declaration that she was ill at ease both lord devereux and sir philip mornings followed the damsels to the large low pleasant chamber with the rich gilding of its panelled walls its bay windows and carved chimney where the young kinswomen surrounded by their female attendants pursued their several avocations at the tapestry loom or the broidery frame for the first five minutes a dead silence vol in k reigned in the apartment the lady helen was what an enemy would have called sullen and a friend would have dignified by the name of melancholy and her handmaidens dutifully followed their ladys example agnes was the first to speak

marguerite de bethany said poynings aiding his fair mistress in her attempt to bring about conversation when i left the chateau of st germains mademoiselle had taken it into that silly head of hers that the count wooed her for her broad lands and the more he courted and flattered the more she disbelieved until at last twas a moot point whether the pretty heiress would not fling herself and her fiefs and vineyards olive grounds and all into a nunnery from mere distrust and suspicion what might be the end of that love passage arthur why the little damsel improved day by day in mistrust and jealousy until as thou sayst twere a chance but she took refuge in the chiuxh from poor maximilians luckless courtship and so it chanced that one fair summer morning standing beside a close planted

really intend to walk out on this wind said caroline selby the only daughter and heiress of lady selby of selby park to her young cousin lucy more a london girl who had recently arrived on a visit at the park and who emancipated for almost the first time in her life from the restraints and confinement of a great city enjoyed the liberty and fresh air of the country with a zest which her delicate and luxurious kinswoman had some difficulty in comprehending can you really venture to face this wind can i replied lucy gaily can i not did not you promise me only last night to shew me your flowers and your birds your conservatories and greenhouses and hothouses and flowergarden your aviary and your pleasantry and did not my aunt charge me not to let you forget your promise and to go to none of them without you confess this caroline and what but wind bright keen sunny invigorating wind can we look for in the blowy month of march did you never hear sheridans rhyming calendar january snowy february flow march blowy april showery may flowery june bowery july poppy august croppy september poppy october breezy november wheezy december freely why one would as soon object to the sun in june as to the wind the rough pleasant wind that sends one home running glowing laughing at one knows not what in this same month of march eut perhaps you object to the sun in the summer certainly replied caroline gravely i never go out in the summer except indeed for a drive in the pony phaeton as to walking i never dream of such a thing never walk in the summer exclaimed lucy live in this beautiful place which we poor londoners think it a privilege only to see and be content to drive about in a carriage oh my dear cousin what woukl we give for these lawns to run about in i and you really do not walk can such a thing be possible i very seldom do walk as i said before replied miss selby rand most certainly i am not going out this morning and i cant imagine why you should wish to go to get coarse and sunburnt and freckled in this wind when you know that next monday is my birthday and weare to have half the country at our childrens ball well i said lucy suppressing a smile i grant the importance of looking well at the ball especially for you who are its heroine but are you not afraid of growing wan and pale for want of exercise sitting all day after lessons are done poring over this embroidery and making so dismal a avast of floss silk and gold thread come and show me the pheasants and the flowers if only for the sake of your complexion oh no rejoined her cousin one has always exercise enough with skipping and the dumbbells and just now i have to practise my shawl dance which charlotte grist brought out at her benefit and which i have promised mamma to dance on wednesday no fear of my wanting exercise i promise you and you really wont come then exclaimed lucy somewhat disappointed well perhaps the day may be calmer tomorrow for lady selby desired me not to go to the garden or the aviary without you and of course i shall not think of disobeying her i dare say the wind will be stiller tomorrow and in the meantime ill hunt up the old bailiff and get him to give me a lesson in agriculture so that i may not mistake wheat for grass again as happened yesterday to the immortal honour of my eockneyship its a mercy i did not take the contents of the field for a crop of clover or turnips for they being all green the thing might have happened added lucy as she ran away laughing at her own blunders the gayest and happiest creature that ever gladdened that often dull place a quiet home in a great city lucy moore had the unspeakable advantage of being the daughter of a man of considerable talent and limited income her father was a barrister who had at last by patience and assiduity won through the long probation which that most difficult and uncertain of all professions requires in england andwas now rapidly rising in practice and in reputation but as his private sortie was small and his family large he continued to live in the most prudent and moderate style so that his daughter unspoilt either by overindulgence or overeducation those two dangers of the children of the rich accustomed to make her own amusements and to find gratification in the humblest pleasures brought into the country those two prime requisites for enjoyment a healthy mind and a healthy body her cousin on the other hand the petted heiress of a wealthy and widowed mother and the flattered </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> flattered pupil of a fashionable governess was already at thirteen a complete specimen of a modern fine lady vain selfish indolent and only to be roused into exertion by the desire of display lady selby idolizing mother though she were had yet upon a casual visit to her sister been struck with the difference between the fretful languor of caroline and the goodhumoured cheerfulness of her cousin and had invited lucy to the park with a latent though unacknowledged wish that the animation and sweetness which she found so delightful might prove contagious and partly from a desire to keep the girls constantlytogether partly from a hint of her family physician on the advantage of air and exercise arose the charge to lucy not to visit the conservatory or the flower garden the pleasantry or the aviary without miss caroline well however as lucy loved flowers and birds and much as she lead heard of the splendour of her cousins collection she contrived to and plenty of amusement in her mornings walk without their aid her friend the old bailiff enraptured with her frankness her gaiety her intelligence and her ignorance for the youthful ignorance that seeks for information is always charming led her half over his own territory the home farm and not only gave her the despised instruction on grains and giasses but volunteered a lesson on shrubs and trees and timber in general from the budding hazel to the rugged oak to which his little grandson a lad of about nine years of age who accompanied them added a practical lecture on those inhabitants of treetops called birds and their sayings and doings in the shape of songs and birdnests so that between her two companions edward and his grandfather lucy had never been more gratified this happened on a tuesday wednesday was still windy and caroline was still indisposed for any exercise but that of the shawldance so that lucy was fain to have recourse to the escort of edward who had arrived to offer his services with a present of a string of birds eggs half adozen yards long his prime treasure which had it been a rope of pearls he would equally have offered so completely had lucys sweet manners won his heart he was but too happy to accompany her about the park and show her the dells where the primroses grew thickest and the sunny banks where the purple violets literally coloured the ground thursday was damp and caroline afraid of taking cold stuck to her embroidery and her shawl dance friday was cold and still miss caroline dared not venture saturday was sunny intolerably sunny and the fair heiress feared for her complexion sunday the weather was perfect neither windy nor sunny nor damp nor cold but miss selby having ridden to church in a close carriage discovered that having been out once that morning she could not go out again monday was the day of the ball when of course its young heroine never dreamt of encountering additional fatigue and lucy returning from her ramble was thinking with mingled pleasure and amusement that after that evening she would stand some chance of seeing the birds and the flowers which she had now been a week in the home without catching a glimpse of and that at all events she would after that night see no more of the shawldance of which all charlotte as caroline thought herself her cousin began to be a little weary when on entering the hall she found the whole family in confusion and dismay surgeons sent for the ball postponed and the entire household in consternation practising the eternal shawldance and using for the first time the new and splendid scarf which had been sent from london for the purpose miss selbys foot had caught in the drapery and after refraining for a whole week to go a hundred yards from the halldoor with her visitor in order to preserve herself in beauty for this ball a worse misfortune than taking cold or looking worse or tanned or freckled had befallen the fair terpsichore she had sprained her ankle and the famous dance remained enhanced and the festival was put aside whilst its poor heroine continued during the showery month of april and the flowery may just lifted from her bed to the sofa fretting over her compelled and therefore irksome confinement and longing for nothing so much as the power of getting out with lucy her kind and tender nurse to the conservatory and the pleasantry the aviary and the flowergarden making tiiuous resolutions against indolence and shawldances and agreeing in the sage moral deduced by her cousin from this accident that nothing can be worse for young ladies or for the matter of that for old ones either than the power of having at all times and on all occasions completely their own way vol iii l a chapter from the chronicles of adlersberg my highblown pride at length broke under me shakspeare part i showed how the lady ermengarde earned for herself that ill title of the proud lady there are few midwinter nights seemingly so long or so dreary as the one fragrant hour between a july moonset and daydawn was felt to be by one lonely watcher in the beleaguered tower of adlersberg the aged and pious cistercian father cyril it was no light fear that could cause the good monk to quail and tremble with apprehension through that fairest and freshest of summer hours when the dew a natural rosary hangs impearled upon the tree of the forest and the herb of the field calling sinful souls to prayer and praise o light or vain imaginings could so perturb his spirit for he had been accustomed to sharp penances being a man by nature of rebellious passions one who as folk have told even certain of the aged brethren of st basil his own convent had in his time undergone fierce and frequent struggles with the evil one loth to quit his hold upon so strong a heart but what he thought or what he felt or what he feared during that weary space when the sand passed once through the hour glass as he knelt before the window looking out beyond the grim battlements of the tower repeating again and again with his lips the ave to which no l2 effort could bend this mind the desperate fear of that hour was sorer to abide than fast or vigil haircloth or scourge or the far harder conflict with the foe within the worldly desires and revengeful promptings which had darkened the days of his riot youth xo sound of succour yet muttered he and scarce the faintest streak of day in the east oh holy mother bring on the dawn ere i perish of expectation conrad oswald methinks i hear a stir beneath the walls amongst our besiegers they keep true watch whilst our varlet conrad i say oswald theodore they heed me not worn out poor knaves with the assault of yestereve an egbert were here he would have heard me oh if this coming day bring not the landgrave to our aid then blessed virgin i dare not think of what will follow look down upon us mary full of grace save this innocent maiden from the false baron who partly to possess himself of her broad lands partly to avenge her refusal of his proffered hand hath set himself down before her castle with mercenaries from far lands bowmen from the cantons lancers from the thine the swarthy sons of the south and the fairhaired dane have joined the league and swears shame to knighthood i that ere the siege be raised the lady ermengarde shall sue to him aye on her bended knee to plight the troth she spurned so haughtily whilst he that noise again it is too surely the trampling of feet the clattering of armour the bursting hark i amiat sound is that of a surety the great gates be creaking on their hinges the foe will be upon us ere i can varn the noble maiden or gather her defenders around her and snatching up a huge sword father cyril departed on his double errand of seeking the lady ermengarde and collecting the over worn vassals and domestics who under the command of the seneschal had hitherto held the besiegers at bay expecting every day the relief which now seemed hopeless trembling with age and his own impatient spirit chafing at the wrong he lacked power to redress the monk tottered through a long stone hall which pierced the castle from east to west when he was stayed by a sight piteous to look upon the lady ermengarde worn by the watching and misery of this cruel and obstinate siege when was ever maiden beset so rudely for her broad lands and her strong towers had been seized by </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> by slumber she that coy and stately maiden even in the open gallery chamber where menatarms might be each instant passing to and fro she had fallen into a inside chair and was now as fast asleep as though the sister angels love and peace kept watch beside her pillow dolefully wan was her cheek as if the pale maiden roses had been washed white with bitter tears and her long yellow hair all upbraided hung round her like a veil her rich garments were disordered and stained none who had seen her then would have called her by the name she had borne to her present undoing the proud lady of adders none would have believed that such a title could have belonged to one so gentle and so sad all the sadder seemed her sleep for the faint smile that lingered round her lips few were in the castle save untrained lacqueys and rude grooms sorry protectors even had their numbers equalled those of their assailants whilst without the walls pressed onward that audacious baron and his riotous soldiery resolute to storm the castle and bear away the heir and yet there she sat in her loveliness drooping and pallid as a lily broken down by a summer shower but with such a look of peace and love as if her cheek were resting upon her mothers bosom father cyril bent over that fair form he could not pass her without a prayer and the tears would fall from his agedeyes upon her slender hands unconscious as she was of his presence or his sympathy but the prayer and the tears were stayed by surprise as in spite of the closecoming peril every passing instant making it clearer that the foe was astir beneath the monk could not choose but start and bless himself as he bethought him of the waywardness of womans will whilst he gazed upon a quaintly fashioned oaken cross nestled in the white bosom which if court gossips said truth had disdained to wear a carkanet of ruby stones proffered by the hand of a kings son now there belonged to that small oaken cross the old tale of love repaid by scorn of highborn beauty looking disdainfully at lowly faith of patient service and insolent rebuke which makes one of the darkest and thorniest pathways of the tangled labyrinth called life and sure tale is it and sad as true the cabin looks across the valley to the castle and says we both contain human hearts and the castle ah welladay for womans haughtiness said i not that she was called the proud lady of adlersberg egbert with the raven locks was the son of the ladys falconer almost he might have been called her fosterbrother since an orphan from her earliest days his mother was the lady emiengardes nurse nevertheless the boy was so much older than the fair girl as to bestow upon him the privilege of enacting the part of her protector in the sports of their childish days his father old heinrich was as i have said the falconer of what place the youth egbert filled were hard to tell by his good leave none but himself should have served his fair mistress he alone tended her favourite hawks the tassel gentil from isorway that the emperor rode fifty leagues to see strike down her quarts was of egberts training egbert held her greyhound in his silken leash none save egbert taught her jennet his paces or held her bridle rein the very pinks and cauliflowers that grew in a nook beside the north bastion alack the hoof of the warhorse hath trampled it low were of egbeits tending he brought her a dappled fawn whose dam had been killed by some eobin hood of the black forest and even whilst echoing her maledictions on the heartless churl who had orphaned her spotted favourite he climbed the topmost bough of a stately beech to steal for her the golden couplets of the turtledove emblems too true of his despairing passion in early youth almost in boyhood he had twice so said the bowerwomen saved his fair mistresss life once in the chase when the boar stood fiercely at bay and egbert came between the furious animal and the lady ermengarde and stretched the fierce and dangerous quarry dead at her feet and again when autumn rains had swollen the summer brook to a torrent and her parley borne along by the strong current lost his footing and was carried helplessly dottl the stream oh how egbert plunged into those deep waters i how he grasped the rein and breasted the food and plucked the lady fiom her sinking steed and laid her safe albeit trembling upon the grassy bank those were happy days for poor egbert but boyhood glided rapidly into youth and youth again passed into manhood and then weary of courtship and of suitors and perchance the more severe with egbert the humblest and faithfulness of all he who dared to love but not to woo the severer outwardly with him and with herself because half conscious of some relenting softness in her inmost heart then it was that she earned by bitter speech and haughty bearing the title of the proud lady of adlersberg curiously ready in handicrafts of divers sorts as though the skill he had never learned were born with him egbert was wont to beguile his lonely evenings for the good falconer his father and his mother the nurse of the proud lady were dead and gone or to employ himself over the christmas hearth whilst old wives told old stories and minstrels and troubadours chanted their relays with fashioning rosaries and bowls and coffers and suchlike toys to trhich the craft of the workman gives their price and amongst he rest of his trinketry he had carved this humble crucifix from a fallen branch of oak which he had one day lifted from his ladys path and had even dared to convey it into her bower wreathed round with a garland of most rare flowers some said arranged after the manner of the turkish paynim whereby buds and blossoms are made to discourse love well did father cpil remember the wrath which had flashed from the maidens eyes and the angry words in which she had commanded that egbert should be chased from the demesne and the cabin where he dwelt razed to the ground a warning said she and her lip cuiied as she spake to suitors of all degrees from the prince to the serf well also did he remember what was told by the bower woman of a pleading voice that was heard under the windows of her chamber and that the lady ermengarde had caused it to be proclaimed throughout the castle that if that voice were again to disturb her slumbers the seneschal had it in command to loose the bloodhounds and fiom that time forth naught more was said of egbert but the lady waxed prouder to all wooers and sad and fitful in hall or bower and now behold when years had passed and egbert with the raven curls was well nigh forgotten it was the scorned relic of his aspiring suit the very oaken cross carved by his hand which in that moment of extremity was found to be worn secretly in the icy bosom of that cold and haughty beauty brief space had father cyril to marvel at womans changeful fantasy again the clash of armour below again that fearful soit as though the drawbridge were stealthily lowered and the portcullis suddenly raised and the great gate gently opened i will not waken her for yet a moment said the good old man and grasping his weapon he sallied forth to inquire what these noises might mean part ii showed wherefore the effigy of the oaeex cross came to be cut en stone en the gallery op the castle of short time was father cyril thence he won back speedily to the side of the lady ermengarde still smiling faintly in her sleep and made rough and hasty by the sure knowledge of instant peril he seized her chi pale hands and raised her suddenly from the chair waken poor maiden waken allis lost our last hope is gone avliat is this responded that sad lady scarcely aroused from her pleasant dreams to the sense of present danger gertrude oswald where be ye eoisabella not yet saddled we ride forth todays but her words ceased on a sudden for she read in the flashing eye the quivering lip and the changed bearing of the old man well nigh distraught with fear and anger that somewhat terrible had chanced albeit her wildest fantasy had pictured naught so terrible as his tidings they have deserted us vassal and menial groom and manatarms the page that served the cup in the hall the tirewoman that </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> that decked thee for the banquet all have forsaken us iay that maketh but a portion of their treason the defences of this thy place of strength drawbridge portcullis even the iron gate have they opened to the enemy false traitors that they be and then withdrawn their own base persons by the eastern postern we two are lost alas that i should live to see thee in such a strait and have no power to aid or rescue we two are alone in the castle heady ermengarde bore a high heart and refrained from womanish lamentations from shrieks and tears she clasped the crucifix to her bosom no longer caring whether it were hidden or no may the blessed virgin look down upon us was all that she said then after a pause and in a firmer voice she added was this treachery father or fear a mixture perchance of both fair daughter the seneschal i have misdoubted long he hoary traitor hath sold himself body and soul for vile lucre vol itt m and cowardice and base terror seconding the false knaves persuasions have corrupted the rest oh that i could meet that judas old though i be nay nay kind father grasp not thy sword we have more need of thy rosary the noise thickens about us clashing of armour and trampling of steeds sounds such as tell of strife and struggle seek not to drag me hence father cyril the courts must be filled with the rude soldiery i will rest here and abide my enemy pray for us both and let not thy voice falter saidst thou that all had forsaken me that of the many who filled my halls and owned my rule none remained to defend his poor mistress not so replied a voice from the threshold as a young man stood there with a sword ready drawn in his hand you have yet left you one defender lady of adlersberg beside the good father and the holy saints and thy foes shall bestride his dead body before a hair of your fair head shall be touched avhoso spake these words cried the lady ennengarde greatly troubled staying herself against father cyril to hinder her from falling he also the good father was strangely moved for the speech sounded to both like a voice from the grave and they perceived that the speaker was nene other than the falconers son egbert of the raven locks the young man remained on the threshold looking away while he spoke remember you not lady of adders that i warned you that this day might come eemember you not that i besought you in the day of your bitter scorn to take heed how you trampled upon the true heart that never would betray or forsake you in sorrow or in peril remember you not the firebrand that laid m 2 waste the cottage of your fathers ancient and faithful servant of your own foster mother they were dead but not the less should their dwelling the dwelling of their only child have been sacred to ennen garde of adlersberg and those bloodhounds remember you not them and how for a avhole night they tracked as they might have tracked a murderer or a thief one whose only crime lay in your beauty and will you not remember when this dark hour hath passed that it was he the despised the trampled on the outcast who returned to share your peril to die at your feet for as god is my witness i look to leave my corpse upon these stones too happy so to die loveliest and most beloved forgive me these my ungenerous reproaches thrice blessed to die for thee how fared it now think you with the proud lady ermengarde fain would she have made reply fain by words or tears have done honour to such exceeding constancy and nobleness but she could not speak she could only point with her finger to the crucifix upon her bosom well might the youth egbert start to see his own poor lovetoken so richly graced but no time alas this for discourse or dalliance the heavy tread of armed men echoed through the castle sounding to that poor maiden like her death knell whilst her bold champion bent his gaze on the stair up which the soldiery were crowding and standing a little aside drew a long breath and manfully grasped the sword in his hand speak to him for me father cyril murmured the lady half dead betwixt love shame and fear w wilt thou let him die and she uplifted her voice so as to be distinctly heard by him to whom she spoke i entreat thee kind egbert for the love of heaven i adjure thee by this blessed cross stay not here to peril thy life for me dost hear me egbert father would i die a thousand fold but egbert answered not unless bending to kiss that token crucifix as ermen garde held it in her hand and then grasping the sword with a firmer clutch and a look of high resolve might be held for answer nearer and nearer came that heavy tread the tread of mailclad men mingled with hoarse voices and clang of arms and that poor lady already beheld mounting the stair host upon host of strange rough visages gleaming fiercely under their glittering helms she shrank shuddering from the sight and closed her eyes and tried to pray clinging closely to father cyril who would fain have been safely rid of his fair burthen that he might have borne a manful part in that fearful and most unequal struggle cheerily the warrior band advanced toward the gallery chamber as men who bring with them a sure welcome but as the foremost passed the arched portal the ringing blow of a sword was followed by a low groan and the clang of armour as one fell dead across the threshold then arose a fierce cry hew him down cleave him to the waist whoso caret bar the way of the landgrave look up bright lady you are rescued she heareth the voice that proud lady she

of aldersberg cast away her pride and amidst tears and blushes proclaimed her lover the falconer s son bestowed upon him that poor egbert her hand and her rich domains and caused the oaken cross

a favourite dog and who has not who have felt the solace of his mute sympathy in affliction and the animation and gaiety which his gambols throw around our happier hours will not disdain to participate in the grief of the humble family of angus cameron as they gazed upon the faithful creature who after lifting up his head and looking in his masters face for the last time sank patiently

denunciations upon the cowardly tyrant who had slain in wantonness of anger and power the best and bravest dog that ever trod the braes of glendorroch the peculiar circumstances of the people and the time lent a double force to the old clansmans malediction it was about twenty years after the fortyfive in which unhappy insurrection the chief of that branch of the cameronss together with many chieftains of that brave and ancient house had adhered to the last to the fortunes of charles edward had been attainted and forfeited and had died brokenhearted and in exile fais only son too young at the time of the rebellion to pahtake of his fathers guilt the old retainer did not give that name to the part his leader glendoitoch took in that remarkable rising was deprived of his inheritance whilst the large property from </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> from which he derived his territorial title was bestowed upon a campbell the sworn enemy of the clan who had intermarried tvith a distant kinswoman of the cameronss he too was dead leaving only a daughter reared and educated in england whilst an english or at the best a lowland scot elliott of the debateable land was placed by the campbell her fathers kindred as agent looker factor which ever were the obnoxious word for a most obnoxious office over the estates and vassals of the young heiress he it was a keen sportsman and a hot and fiery man who already deeply unpopular amongst the clan with whose language and manners he was unacquainted and whom he at once mistrusted and despised he it was this very gilbert elliott who had now filled up the measure of his sins by shooting bran whilst little jeanie was crying herself into comparative calmness over the body of the faithful creature so long her playmate angus found a relief nearly similar in pouring forth in his native gaelic the story of his wrongs with a fury and energy which really amounted to eloquence so deeply was the old man stung by the mingled passions of grief and hate the story in plain english and separated from angus camerons bitter vituperation was briefly this elliott who had as it appeared instant occasion for red deer venison to celebrate the coming of age and expected arrival of the fair heiress had set forth before sunrise upon this unlucky morning attended by two or three highland gillies and a brace of welltrained dogs with the purpose of stalking some deer which had been seen upon the hills beyond the lake at length he reached a station where concealed by a tret he was enabled to take a true aim at the noble deer which he had been dodging for so many hours when just as he had raised his rifle to fire at the quarry which stood half suspicious half secure on the brow of a small eminence within range of a shot the baying of a hound was heard on the other side of the hill and in an instant the stag bounded away out of sight and hope and bran who had unhappily attended his master probably for some purpose not far dissimilar dashed towards the very spot from whence his approach had driven the destined prey the temptation of immediate vengeance not merely upon the poor dog but upon his master for the loss of his game proved irresistible elliott fired and bran fell and the scene of fierce and angry recrimination which followed ended in the lowlander demanding the firearms of which as he justly said the law forbade not merely the use but the possession among the forfeited clans and on the veterans indignant refusal to deliver up his weapon he gave him notice that he should send not merely to take away by force all weapons found in the cottage by the brae but to dislodge the inhabitants and if need were to pull down the dwelling the teddy quoth the man of office shall find nae nest of rebels on her land gin fire and sword can do their work the teddy said old angus to his daughter quoting the title with peculiar bitterness the teddy and this to the fosterfather added he in the language of old gael in which the remainder of the dialogue was earned on of claude the rightful chief ye drew your earliest nourishment from the same bosom kathleen were carried in the same arms many a time hath my poor wife owned that she loved the brave boy that was after he was an orphan cathleen as well as her own fair girl oh that he were but here there be hearts and arms enow in glendoitoch to teach this sassenach looker that the cameronss will submit to no womans rule least of all when that woman is a campbell you forget dear father rejoined cathleen that the blood of the cameronss also flows in the veins of the yoimg heiress 1 would she were arrived she at least is not responsible for the evil deeds of her kinsmen and guardians or for the hasty and violent doings of their factor and if she bear a womans heart she will not see a white haired follower of her mothers house turned with his widowed daughter and her helpless bairn to couch with the hill fox and the roe i would that the lady of glendorroch were here rather far rather than the brave and gracious boy may heaven bless and prosper him whom we cannot but call the chief too much of kindly blood hath been shed in glendorroch we must have no struggle dear father must not give just cause for severity to these sassenach rulers hark who beats at the door the factor and his folk replied angus grasping his weapon with a resolute air no no was the answer as she lifted the latch and admitted a fair haired young man who gazing at her for a moment with his whole heart in his radiant smile and joyous eyes threw his arms round her waist exclaiming why have you forgotten your foster brother claude i glendorroch cried the father and daughter involuntarily all the faithful clansmans devotion was in one greeting as the old man doffed his bonnet to his chief all the tender womans affection in the other as she pressed the hand of her old playfellow cheerfully and cordially were theirs returned claudes look as he resumed his old seat by the ingle side and looked about and spake to angus as if they had parted yesterday making acquaintance with jeanie alluding slightly but feelingly to the loss of her father and vol in n entering into the general grief and indignation for the death of bran the descendant of a race of dogs who had belonged to the chieftains of glendorroch from generation to generation the saxon churl muttered he he shall abide the deed and then waiving off until another time the particular account of himself and his fortunes which their affectionate interest required and deserved and saying only generally that he had entered the service of a german prince and after filling the post of aidedecamp to a distinguished officer had accompanied his old commander on an important embassy so that his prospects were fair he returned to the grievance of the hour and offered his assistance to jeanie who was by this time seated on his knee to dig a grave among the birds and gowans for her poor favourite they sallied forth accordingly it was a bright autumn evening the hills were purple with heather whilst the narrow valley through which the bright bum ran wimpling was green as an emerald except where the sun slept with a golden shine upon patches of velvet turf and the holly and the mountain ash with their coral berries crept up the sides of the hills tufts of bluebells waved lightly in the ail and the silver bark of the weeping birch glittered through the light and feathery foliage the scene was full of pastoral beauty and claude cameron surveyed it nth the feelings of an exile restored to his native land f eelhigs with whose unusual softness the failings of the tenderhearted little girl over her dead favourite accorded well the young soldier would have respected in another the tears that certainly stood in his eyes if they did not find their way down his cheeks nevertheless he was a little ashamed of the emotion and gathered himself up quickly when just as he was replacing the turf over brans humble grave he heard loud sounds of contest and distress from the path leading to the cottage and was aware of gilbert elliotts myrmidons thrusting forth angus cameron in spite of the old mans sturdy resistance and the alarmed cries of his daughter in an instant claude was at their side the weapon withheld with a lions strength from the factors emissaries was yielded with a childlike docility such was the instinct of feudal obedience to his chieftain the real although unacknowledged head of clan cameron and one word spoken apart aided by the chink of gold in a well punished purse overcame the lesser difficulty of persuading gilbert elliotts people to stay any further proceedings until the arrival of the lady now from intelligence communicated by an avant courier confidently expected on the morrow the morrow came and gathered together by every means which the indefatigable factor could devise half the retainers of the house awaited the youthful heiress before the gates of glendorroch our friends angus and cathleen accompanied by little jeanie attended in fulfilment of a promise to claude who was nowhere visible the old man was dark and gloomy and so was all around in spite of young girls </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> girls carrying baskets of flowers and children with garlands and pipers playing the gathering and a brokennosed cannon firing as often in the half hour as an engineer marvellously well adapted to his artillery being lame of an arm and leg could contrive to compass every outward symbol of welcome that mere power could command was prodigally bestowed nothing was wanting except that true and genuine love and loyalty which no helen campbell none save the real chieftain of old line could excite in the warm hearts of their faithful people the lady arrived as fair a helen as any since that first and frailest of the name who wrought the woes of troy all smiles and blushes the fair lady came but few gazed upon her for at her side sat a noblelooking man in the very prime of life in whom the crowd recognised at a glance the youth brought up in anguss cottage the rightful heir of glendonoch all eyes were fixed upon him as leaping from the carriage he half lifted out his lovely companion turned her gently abashed and shamefaced as she stood towards the wondering and expectant throng and doing gallantly his plumed bonnet said with a countenance radiant with happiness friends and kinsmen this is your lady and mine my own dear wife helen cameron put out the light and then shakspeare a light upon the cliff above the cottage sayst thou senor don jose a light from the post which i have in charge a signal to the smugglers belike or the enemy xow by st ago great man as thou thickest thyself procurator and what not thou mayst rue the day when thou insulted an old soldier and an old castilian i there is some pith and marrow left in this right arm still continued the veteran extending as tough and sinewy a limb as ever grasped a toledo and by our lady of pity lie who accuses me of treason is like to feel its weight were he twenty times a procurator if catalina had married thee now as thou wanted last vintage or if i had acceded to thy other proposal and exchanged my good olive ground for thy patch of vineyard we might never have heard of this matter eut the girl and her father were both of them wiser i warn thee once again meddle not with an old soldier nay good diego rejoined the little lawyer shrinking instinctively fiom the harsh tones and threatening gestures of him of the beacon rock the saints only know whether catalina or i should have had the worst of that bargain and as to my sunny vineyard its worth a dozen of thy lean liungiy olive grounds any day in the year 1 bear thee no malice however senor diego continued the procurator in the spiteful accent in which a disclaimer of spite is usually pronounced i bear no malice either to thee or to senora mercia thy wife and still less to catalina only i warn thee once more that if the beacon on the cliff be again seen alight without orders from the christine chiefs the warder will right speedily find himself within the walls of a prison and off the little lawyer walked after taking two or three steps however he returned perhaps senor diego if you really know nothing of the matter i love to be candid where i can the pretty damsel lina may have caused the blaze by way of signal to her muleteer lover gil gomez and now having shot off his last arrow the worthy attorney walked himself off with a comfortable persuasion that he had made his old acquaintance and wouldwobe fatherin law thoroughly uncomfortable our friend diego was as lie had truly said an old soldier and an old castilian brought to the frontier by some one of the many captains who had fought the cause of the infant queen with more or less ill success and placed in a post of real rather than ostensible trust and importance as being one upon whose good faith and intelligence reliance might be safely placed the beacon cliff with which at its only point of access his cottage communicated was a lofty and almost perpendicular rock commanding alike the seacoast and the mountains and most useful as a signal post for the transmission of local intelligence to the bands in those wild hills and the ships in the offing a narrow wooded drawbridge beneath which gushed a rapid stream led from the gallery which surrounded diegos dwelling to the only level spot upon the beacon cliff from that landing to the summit the ascent as viewed from below was apparently impracticable to any foot less light and tenacious than that of the goat or the chamois but certain slight inequalities natural or artificial winding round the face of the rock gave to the bold and practised climber sufficient footing to gain the small platform upon which swung from a strong iron pole a bucket of the same material filled with tar and with the resinous woods of the country of which easily ignited and highly combustible materials a stock sufficient for many months consumption was deposited on the spot a more effectual signal post could hardly be devised and in the disturbed state of the country agitated by civil war plagued by the bold inland smugglers called contrabandistas and exposed to so much change and anarchy that the english naval officers ever the queen regents best allies hardly knew whether the district was possessed by carlists or christine the beacon confided as it had been to bold and faithful hands had often led to successful cooperation and prevented a useless sacrifice of men and ammunition diegos family consisted of his goodwife mencia and his pretty daughter catalina who as we have just seen had made him an effectual enemy by refusing the meddling lawyer don jose ortiz a wizenfaced withered sample of the spanish hidalgo who and we suppose the attorneyphobia is the same in all nations had been for years the pest and dread of the country round and found his power rather extended than limited by the present state of partisan warfare inasmuch as by keeping fair with both parties and denouncing very impartially friend or foe to whichever happened to be uppermost he contrived to increase his importance and fill his coffers his accusation lied completely mystified poor diego especially that part which alluded to catalina the beacon alight last night i impossible so rau his halfmuttered thoughts poor liii that she does like that gay muleteer gil gomez with his songs and his mandoline is i fear too true and after all if he have money enough to keep the girl comfortably why should they not marry some day or other tis a lighthearted good humoured spark and she fancies him as twenty years ago i fancied her mother but as to linas lighting the beacon with the great key of the house door under my pillow and at night too when i myself can hardly keep my footing and she never up there except once or twice when she would goto help me to carry the fir faggots and was forced to turn back before she got halfway for very giddiness bah i the things impossible and by santiago the beacon could not be alight tis a lie of that cankered little lawyer and does not deserve another thought ill just go and ask mcncia whether she locked the door of the balcony last night of course she did and that door being locked how could lina get to the drawbridge and why should she light the beacon bah ita lie from the first word to the last and ill think no more of it forming internally this wise resolution but unable to direct his mind to any other subject diego for this conversation had happened in the olive ground on which don jose had cast his eye strode rapidly towards his cottage as he neared which shrill sounds of female voices gave token of an animated discussion between senora mencia the wife of his bosom and certain neighbours her gossips and friends he arrived in time to hear their dismissal the beacon alight good blancaa and you saw it with your own eyes you and pepita you must have been dreaming good people leo soul could get to the rock except from the drawbridge that leads from our balcony and i locked the door myself with these hands you were dreaming good gentlefolk pepita there says she saw santa teresa clad in white flying over the top of the rock santa teresa quotha a fair good day to ye ladies both santa teresa forsooth as if my husband diego hernandez could not manage his oyti beacon without her help santa teresa to be sure there was a chapel dedicated to her but the carlists rent </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> rent that down santa teresa continued senora mencia upon whose nerves the notion of a saint clad in white flying about so near their cottage seemed to have made an unpleasant impression i hope we say as many aves as our neighbours i wonder whether burning a candle before our lady of pity or to vow a pilgrimage ill ask father jerome did you see the light of the beacon last night lina added her mother as the voice of the dark eyed beauty was heard from the cottage singing one of the many songs which gil gomez had composed in her honour she interrupted herself to answer senora mencias question and then recommenced her song the beacon last night no dear mother girls for truant hearts a playing vainly vaunted charms arraying flower and veil and fan you ply one rare spell your snares is spoiling as oer steep sierra toiling homeward comes your favourite boy mid the mules before him creeping mid his comrades round him sleeping sees he only guess and sigh leave that foolish song catalina and answer me at once did you see santa teresa last night flying over our rock santa teresa flying over our rock dear mother exclaimed catalina in very natural astonishment santa teresa flying over our rock heard ever mortal such a question santa teresa clad in white rejoined mercia pepita and blancaa vow by all the saints that they saw her light the beacon last night and then fly away over the face of the cliff they talked too of coming to watch again tonight they have been dreaming mother poor old pepita passes her life in seeing visions poor old pepita she is not what she used to be since the loss of her son you must have seen how her poor white head shakes under her mantilla but she is a kind creature to be sure blancaa ought to have known better but vol ui dreams are catching dear mother especially dreams of the saints and you know my father has always from motives of prudence made a little mystery of this beacon are you quite sure that he did not light it last night i saw nothing 1 heard nothing but i sleep so sound for gil could never wake me sighed she in a lower voice i wish gil were here again safe from these dangerous passes and then the song was resumed as she went quietly about her household work girls whose lattice late he haunted merry gil no more enchanted laughs if frown or smile ye ply one thing only tempts iiis glances in the churches markets dances though a queen herself were by one bright star hath fixed him yonder to a lovelier gentler fonder must i name it linas eye i am indebted for these characteristic stanzas with their pretty castanet snap to one who excels me in a great many points of authorship besides the writing of national songs my kind and valued friend mr henry chorley this dialogue which he had overheard ithout making his appearance either to the departing guests or the incensed hostess did not tend to quiet the keeper of the beacon catalinas words and manner had completely assured him that she had no hand in the matter and although a devout son of the catholic church he was yet a person of too much sense to put any faith in the st teresa version of the story he had however from the testimony of the two women confirming as it did that of don jose little doubt but the rock had really been ascended and the beacon lighted probably by some daring carlist spy to lead the crews and commanders of the english vessels upon the coast into a trap by inducing them to land upon some spot only too well prepared for their reception and he determined to walk to marquis a small ttl in the neighbourhood for the double purpose of hearing whether any mischief had befallen by sea or land and to secure some resolute man to watch with him the ensuing night if poor gil were here thought he as he passed through a grove of fine cork trees echoing unconsciously his daughters dearest wish or failing him lope mureno he is strong agile and resolute aye til secure lope mureno and well conceal ourselves among the pine faggots on the platform or keep guard below according to circumstances twelve hours had passed since the conversation between jose and diego in the oliveground it was now midnight and dark from the want of moon but clear and cloudless this is a strange story that ked miles has told us and still stranger is that which we have gathered from these women said captain heywood to his first lieutenant mr deane as they were pacing the sands beneath the rocks trying to keep as much as possible in the shadow but yet where they might see every movement both in the cottage and about the beacon cliff pepita and blancaa were also watching and approaching at some little distance appeared a lightfooted young man picturesque in figure and air with a mandoline in his hand which he now and then struck and humming apparently from the mere impulse of a gay and buoyant temperament brief snatches of many airs however we are not alone in our folly if folly it be continued the english officer for there are the votaries of st teresa and the young man tripping towards us on the other side seems by the description to be the muleteer the lover gil what is his name gil gomez if there be as diego suspects and he has been so constantly faithful and watchful that i rely implicitly upon his word if there bo treachery we shall be strong enough to seize the traitor provided always that he he simple enough to come again ha the muleteer was expected there is a light in catalinas chamber is it not what was described to us as catalinas chamber aye there she is opening the lattice and we shall after all play no more important part than that of witnesses to a serenade no by heaven she is the culprit after all look how she is forcing herself through that barred and narrow casement and the lamp she will set herself on fire no she is through she is letting down the diabridge do you see her deane it is too heavy for her strength it will fall back upon her had we not better call no she has passed it and is climbing the rock she is asleep senor cried the muleteer who by this time had joined them holy mother protect her look how boldly she treads as if unconscious of danger yes it is a case of somnambulism there can be no doubt of it replied captain heywood in spanish nothing can be so lucky as our coming since it frees diego from all suspicion but how to save her she pauses now and if awakened might return without much danger shall we call but what is become of the lover aye i see now he is rousing the mother and getting upon the balcony and more quickly than any except a lover could have reached the rock gil had won to a place where if his fair mistress had fallen he was close behind to save her and then after a gay and lively symphony upon the mandoline which he had still retained he began in a clear manly voice the air which she had herself sung that very evening girls for truant hearts aplaying vainly vaunted charms arraying and before he had finished the first couplet the fair sleeper awakened and fell with a little start trembling into the lovers arms i thought that all things had been savage here shakspeare few families were more chivalrously attached to the person and principles of the unfortunate charles the first than the ancient and wealthy house of coningsby of simonburn and yet such was the jar and conflict of opinion in those stormy days that the leaven democracy and puritanism made itself manifest at an early period of his reign in a younger son of that royal and flourishing race ealpli coningsby the cadet in question was a grave and thoughtful youth who being intended by sir walter to pursue his fortunes at the bar under the auspices of one of the corrupt and subservient judges of the time threw up his profession in disgust at the oppressions of the star chamber and the levity of his fellow templar and returned with all speed to simonbiirn where his departure from the family tenets in politics and religion occasioned to the jolly old knight his father and the gay gallants his brothers much such a shock of painful and ashamed surprise as might have been produced by the discovery of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of some dreadful crime alienated from his relations and connections he was naturally thrown amongst the professors of his own stricter and sterner faith many of whom little anticipating the tremendous convulsion which was about to shake the kingly power to its very foundation were turning their eyes towards that fair xew world that distant and interminable wilderness which the voyages of raleigh had opened to their view and where their wildest visions of religious freedom and republican equality might be realized ealph coningsbys desire to join one of these bands of pilgrims met with a ready assent from sir walter who willingly advanced even at the expense of a grove of oaks at the back of the hall the moderate sum required for the outfit and the voyage so much did he rejoice at the prospect of ridding himself of one whose austerity of morals and of manners was silently felt as a reproach by the whole household even whilst proclaiming him the opprobrium of his race to get rid of the first strict professor that ever bore the name of coningsby the sacrifice of the grove of oaks seemed nothing father than see that rigid and sanctimonious young face glooming twice in every day over the wild fowl and the wine flask in the great hall sir walter would have cut down every tree in the park moderately therefore but sufficiently provided ealph coningsby set sail from the port of hull for few england but although unaccompanied by any of his kindred the young adventurer had a companion on his voyage whose society would have been enough to reconcile him to a less voluntary exile alice eavenshaw was the orphan daughter of a former vicar of simonburn she was an early playmate of ealphs reared in the same tenets and separated by death from all natural ties readily consented to become his wife and to share his fortunes in that distant land a young girl who had been her personal attendant went with them also from pure affection and fidelity and perhaps no three persons ever left their native country with less regret a tedious but on the whole a prosperous yojage brought them to xaumkeak afterwards called salem on the eastern shores of massachusetts and alice and her attendant lucy were speedily settled in a log hut in the middle of a small clearing which ealph with such assistance from the other pilgrims as kindness offered or money could buy applied himself assiduously to bring into cultivation their husbandry prospered ealph young and active and used to the manly exercises of the time foimd health and content in his labours whilst alice and lucy accustomed to the rude and hardy mode of living which was in those days the lot of all except the very highest ranks in thinking of the hardships of the pilgrim fathers we are a little too apt to forget the march of civilization and that the comforts now found in every cottage were then hardly to be commanded in the palace alice and her faithful handmaiden habituated at home to winter and rough weather would have been without a grievance of which to complain had not they naturally cherished an undefined but ungovernable fear of their neighbours of the woods the true lords of the soil the fierce and warlike eed indians even this feeling however was destined to undergo a change one day shortly after she had become a mother mrs coningsby had advanced farther than usual into the woods tempted by the freshness of a close and narrow valley in the bottom of which was a clear dark pool surrounded by magnificent trees whose foliage exhibited all the tender beauty of tint peculiar to that month which the indians call the moon of flowers she had wandered far and was thinking of returning to her home and her infant when her ear was caught by the low wailing of a babe and following the sound she saw a squaw seated on the ground her back supported by a large white oak and an infant clinging to her bosom whilst a warrior stood leaning upon his bow in an attitude of dejection and with an expression of painful suffering which those stoics of the woods seldom allow themselves to exhibit on approaching them nearer she saw that the squaw was dead and that the wailing child was vainly pressing its little fingers against her breast for the nourishment which it could no longer afford the cry of nature is alike in all languages it went straight to the young englishwomans heart she snatched the famished infant from the lap of its dead mother and regardless of colour or race placed it to her own bosom wept over it as it inhaled the nutriment which it so inch wanted and contrived to make the grateful chief understand that his little son should share her cares and her love with her own boy and for above two years exorbitant such was the name of the narragansett chief one of the most powerful of his tribe left the child in her hands at the end of that period just when he had begun to lisp the name of mother a dead deer was one morning found at the door of their cabin and the indian boy was gone time rolled on divisions upon points of doctrine and church discipline had arisen among the religious community of salem as naumkeak was now called and they who had sailed three thousand miles to escape the intolerance of the dominant establishment in the old country became themselves intolerant of the opinions of their neighbours alas and these are the wise ealph coningsby had mingled deeply and bitterly in these differences and partly from that cause partly from an adventurous love of life in the wilderness he and his now large family retired deeper into the woods and were settled at an extensive clearing remote from other habitations one evening the father his two elder sons and their male domestics had gone to some distance to seek for their strayed cattle and their trusty damsel lucy was standing at the door listening to the mournful note of the whippoore will whilst the mother and her younger children were pursuing their customary avocations in the house suddenly lucy rushed in and seized a carbine whilst an arrow falling at mrs coningsbys feet explained too clearly the motive of her vol in p strange action and told the startled household that the periods the most treacherous and dangerous of the indian tribes were upon them in another second before the faithful handmaiden bold from the very desperation of fear could fire the carbine which she had seized they heard the terrible warwhoop and gave themselves up for lost another minute passed the frightened inmates of the dwelling expecting the instant entrance of their merciless foes almost dreading so numerous did they seem that the return of mr coningsby and his sons would but add fresh victims to those whose doom seemed already sealed when they were aware of another and more powerful band of warriors advancing from an opposite point and a yet shriller warwhoop at the sound of which the cowardly periods fled whilst the friendly inarragansetts formed a guard around the house and their young leader approaching jiis coningsby as she advanced to give him entrance bent to kiss her garment and whispered in the broken but wellremembered accents of infancy mother dear mother p 2 murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural shakspeare the tract of land which joins hampshire to berkshire is surprisingly wild and rude considering that it is situated in what maybe called the immediate neighbourhood of the metropolis that is to say within twenty leagues and in the very midst of the best cultivated and most populous district of the south of england it consists of a chain of hills or perhaps more accurate ely speaking of a belt of high tableland so high that the romans those dear lovers of a commanding position in every sense of the word had erected a series of military posts along the line embracing the two picturesque and precipitous stations called caesars camp and the beacon and the city of winchester whose deep fosse now a verdant meadow whose rocklike wall crowned with old trees and twined together with ivy and whose graduated amphitheatre remain almost entire whilst the tesselated pavement of the baths is now and then exposed by the plough and the course of the streets may still be traced by the stunted growth of the springing or ripening corn forming altogether one of the most perfect and curious eoman remains in the kingdom in this tract there were few inhabitants of the higher order divided amongst three or four large and distant landed proprietors the old manorhouses that still remained standing had degenerated </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> degenerated from their pristine rank and beauty into the dwellings of yeomen of the second class while even these farms were from the prevalence of common land remote and unfrequent and the livings were from the same cause so small that two or three of them averse mere appendages to richer benefices and served by curates from the nearest town so that that blessing of a rural district the resident country clergyman a blessing even in his secular capacity as the friend of the poor their comforter in distress and their counsellor in perplexity the educated and intelligent man known to them all and to whom every one may resort with the certainty of commanding his disinterested advice and his zealous services even this important functionary was wanting at alloy as the farmers were few and scattered so were the agricultural population which may be said to depend upon them the very shops were so far apart that if the inhabitants had been more numerous there would have been danger of a famine and before the xew beer act there was not an alehouse in the parish poaching had always flemished in no common measure at alonby but now that a beershop snugly ensconced beneath the very comer of the coppice offered the delinquents a convenient rendezvous the act authorizing the sale of game facilitated the disposal of the spoil the severe and angry keeper found his hares and pheasants disappear with tenfold rapidity this keeper michael parr by name was one of the most important personages of the neighbourhood besides the liberal salary and comfortable residence which lie derived from his situation his late wife had been a widow of some little property for her station and the two young daughters by her first husband who were left under his care and guardianship he had no child himself had each so many hundreds as would render them excellent matches for young men in their own rank of life the younger anne earth was indeed still a child but her sister lucy a girl of nineteen was one whose charm of person and manner her sweetness and gaiety and a certain natural gentility and grace rendered her in addition to her little portion an object of great attraction to the beaux of the village lucys gentil lesse had all the advantage of contrast for although gamekeepers be generally in consequence probably of their frequent intercourse with their masters amongst the best mannered of gentlemens servants michael parr was a notable exception to the rule being about the roughest and suiiiest peasant in the whole county of southampton loud rude overbearing and obstinate how his stepdaughter reared under his roof and with little benefit from female training for her mother had been dead for manyyears came by her smiling gentleness might be a puzzle if we did not every day see living instances of such associations the modest violet springing up from the roots of the gnarled oak aud the woodbine intertwisting its flowery garlands with the dark and prickly leaves of the holly it seems a law of nature that the sweet and gracious should mingle with the stem and the frowning without either losing one particle of its distinguishing quality that lucy would not have been happier with a stepfather of milder mood i do not pretend to say but she had the rare and precious secret of making the best of her situation even under circumstances of more than usual trial to a young and softhearted girl never fret annie said she one day in reply to certain murmuring and pitying of the affectionate and quicktempered child never fret about me times will mend perhaps my father may at last forget this old grudge between him and master prescott for he cannot really believe whatever he may say that either he my lords head woodman or his son are concerned in this poaching which worries him so perhaps master prescott and he may make up matters or perhaps he may learn to distinguish between william and his father i am sure nobody can be more respectful to him than poor william is he treats him as if he were my lord himself or at all events annie even if that shake of the head of yours say true and there is no chance of his relenting why eighteen months will soon pass away and then and titli a bliisli and a smile of exquisite brightness lucy turned away her fair face from her young sister and suddenly stopped as suddenly as if william prescott himself had been there to hear her eighteen months and then i and what then sister inquired annie laughing rhj then you know i shall be one and twenty of age as it is called well but will that make master pan open his front door to let in william prescott xo rejoined lucy but if william should continue in the same mind there will be nothing to hinder me from walking out of the front door to my aunt at belford and then you know annie that by our poor mothers will if when i am oneandtwenty i should happen to to marry and have a home for you you may come if you like and live with me would you come annie would you like to live with william and me would i my own dear lucy would i not and instantly they were clasped in each others arms with the affection that so well became the near and dear relationship by which the young orphans were united this conversation took place as they were arranging the light and pretty cottage kitchen bright and radiant with the mingled effects of cleanliness and order after their noontide meal the repast itself had been embittered to lucy and still more to her loving little sister by the violence and threats of michael parr who had passed the whole of dinnertime in speaking ill of william and his father then with the happy buoyancy of youth came these peaceful and happy anticipations anticipations never destined to be realized the two old men had unluckily met the night before at the sign of the horse shoes a place which although neither was a drunkard both parties visited much too frequently and the keeper whose naturally surly temper was stimulated into tenfold fierceness by beer haying more than insinuated his suspicions that the woodcutter was art and part in the disappearance of his hares and pheasants an accusation which aided in his own case by mine host of the horse shoes good liquor caused his adversarys wrath to blaze forth so wildly that it was as much as the landlord and the rest of his company consisting of the parish clerk the blacksmith and the shoemaker could do to prevent the defiance which each had hurled at the other from ending in a personal conflict whilst william who came in accidentally had caused a diversion of the pugnacious keepers fury by calmly assuring him that some day or other he would repent his present conduct nothing is so provoking to a man in a passion asa cool prediction of this sort from one whose temper is unruffled and this threat as he called it had not only thrown michael parr into fresh fury at the moment but had rankled in his mind to that very hour the last words that he spoke on leaving home implying his fixed resolution to detect the prescott if as he firmly believed they were the poachers and to bring it home to them if it should cost him his life and this was the declaration that had awakened annies sympathy and alarmed her for the fate of her sisters love affair in which like most yoimg girls led by circumstances into such confidences she took a warm and anxious interest with a view to relieve the expression of gloomy thought which clouded lucy s countenance annie exclaimed let us go to the holm coppice lucy after ere have called upon dear aunt benham i have not gathered one primrose this year and i do so love to find the very first besides quoth the little maiden in a half whisper hhey are felling the elms and william will be there let us go to the holm coppice a momentary smile played round lucys rosy mouth love and joy were in every dimple but a moments reflection changed the glad expression of her lovely face although its sweetness was indestructible she shook her head and paused for an instant at the wicket which she was opening xo annie you forget that my father will be there also setting as he declared some trap not for the game but for the poachers and even if he were not in that coppice we ought not to go there it is not maidenly dearest annie to go without cause to the place where and </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense4> and with a bhish quick and unconscious which brought back the smiles and the dimples a blush which rose to her very temples she suddenly paused the time will come mine own annie when you will understand these feelings we must not go to the coppice but we may perhaps meet with some primroses on the southern side of the mount i should like you to find your favourite flower today annie well walk over the mount now this mount as the country people call it is the very perfect remains of the old eoman amphitheatre the level space in the middle a direct and most equal oval with its open entrances for wild beasts at each end and the graduated seats for the spectators rising rank over rank each distinctly traceable although overgrown with ivy and trailing plants and mixed with huge trees the growth of centuries in which the rooks have formed a large and noisy colony this amphitheatre so perfect and yet so changed the oval space in the middle being all that is now clear of wood and which is quite as level as a lawn had been always one of the sisters favourite haunts passing therefore the rocklike walls crowned with pollard oaks and tufted with immense bushes of ivy maple trees and hoary thorns with the dark and mirrorlike pool which reflects so finely the tall elms upon the margin the white speckled clouds and the clear blue sky they reached the amphitheatre and found in a southern nook among the roots of an old beech a tuft of primroses in all the variety of blossom fiom the full expanded flower already fading to the tiniest bud and close beside this fresh fragrant plant at the sight of which annie clapped her vol ni q hands and laughed insensible to the dignity which a maiden almost in her teens ought to have displayed close to the primrose pale she had the delight of finding a halfblown violet dim but sweeter than the lids of junos eyes or cythereas breath at which treasure little annie fairly jumped and shouted with ecstacy and then after gathering her wild nosegay together with other stray blossoms which she had found scattered in that sheltered nook she and lucy proceeded to the widow benhams cottage which stood beside the mount snugly protected from the chill northeast and doubled the pleasure which the flowers had already given her by presenting them to her venerable friend and arranging them in a small cup of delicate old china a relique of better days of which the white ground was almost as transparent as an eggshell while the raised flowers might vie in delicacy of colouring and arrangement even with these the first beauties of the spring mrs benham took the freedom of age and affection to speak of william prescott and lament the squabble at the horse shoes and especially the threat of vengeance of which she had heard and yet he is a e youth lucy and a good son has he been to the dead and the living to her who is gone and to him who remains and the good son dll make the good husband if my brother michael could but be reconciled but we must wait and hope yeare full young yet and may have many happy years in store a blessing will go with you lucy if only for your kindness to a lone widow who has none to care for her now save your gentle heart my precious child and the tears fell from the good dames eyes whilst answering drops mingled with the smiles and blushes on lucys blooming cheeks q 2 it was now sunset for the primrose quest and the daily cares rendered by both the girls to the sick widow had caused the time to pass by unheeded eut it became every moment more and more probable that the keeper always irritable and impatient might return home for his tea and lucy laying aside her scruples respecting william agreed to return by the shortest path in the present case certainly not the quickest for the woodcutter whether attracted by the light and graceful figure as the two young maidens crossed the style leading into the coppice or whether he was really leaving work so that the meeting was purely accidental did yet join the fair sisters just as they were passing rapidly on their way and the five minutes hurried talk which ensued albeit full of fear and consciousness a brief and stolen interview was yet inexpressibly soothing and comfortable to both your stepfathers william who never used illwords towards anybody proved his distaste towards michael parr by the constant addition of that ominous monosyllable never had he been known to say your father your stepfather lucy will repent his unkindness towards us both before long of that i am certain he shall repent it will you go lucy cant you stay a little longer five minutes one this is meeting only to part well then if go you must good night my lucy good night annie if you wont let me return with you i must run back to fetch my axe which i have left in the copse annie i one word annie a secret a great secret lucy must not hear come nearer now listen do contrive to call upon mrs benham just about this time tomorrow and to come back this way manage that for me annie goodnight dear lucy said the lover disappearing over the style annie charmed to find herself of importance and making a great mystery of williams whisper tripped back in the gayest spirits and such is the buoyancy of youth and so contagious the hilarity of a young and innocent girl that unpromising as their prospects appeared lucy herself was happy and hopeful in no ordinary measure little cause had they for the haste which they had made to gain their home before the return of the crossgrained keeper they waited tea the meal which in that sort of life is perhaps especially amongst women that which they like the best they kept the teakettle on their cleanlyswept hearth until an hour so fashionable that it would not have been credited in alloy and when at last they took their own simple meal they deposited the keepers nicelymade toast together with the teapot in the chimney corner to keep it warm for him in case of his returning shivering with cold and fatigue from a night watch of the coverts for with these poor girls lucy especially duty was almost as wakeful and careful as love midnight came and passed and still no signs of michael parr as the night wore on the placid cheerfulness with which the betrothed maiden had been blest yielded natially enough to anxiety and depression the rain had long been pattering on the eaves a cold wind moaned among the tall trees whose huge branches creaked in the rising tempests like the mast of some mighty ship and the dogs the keepers especial charge howled in a manner which even they who are most accustomed to these sagacious animals cannot under certain circumstances help feeling to be ominous however difficult it might be to convey the impression to any who had not heard that most dismal of living sounds hark interrupted annie i hear steps they are coming can that be chloes bark how wild and strange dont open the door yet sister it cant be them and wild and strange was the short quick intermitted bark which sharp piercing and painful even to agony rose above the redoubled chorus of howling from the kennel above the blasts of the tempest and above the steps and voices of many men who were now distinctly heard approaching the cottage they paused in the court afraid it may be to convey to the innocent girls the shock which their dreadful burthen could not fail to impart but chloe had no such scruple she continuing her wild shrill cry flung herself against the door scratching at it with her slender paws as if she would have beaten it in and when lucys trembling hands undid the latch rushed wildly towards the hearth pausing for a moment in front of her masters highbacked oaken chair and then returning restlessly to the group in the court leapt up as if endeavouring to reach some object in the background the sight of chloe had prepared the sisters in some degree for what was to follow the poor dogs silky coat was dabbled in blood not her own and when thomas leigh the underkeeper tried and strong rough man as he was tried in vain to announce the dreadful news to lucy she at once relieved and surprised him by inquiring in a low voice is he dead dead michael parr had been for some hours the body when found was stiff and </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> and cold marks there were of a severe though probably a brief struggle the ground being considerably trodden about and one or two hazel branches broken and torn down but upon the whole the death had been quick and sudden a ghastly wound in the head by some sharp and weighty instrument having extinguished life at a blow beyond this all was mystery the underkeeper thomas leigh whose cottage was placed at a considerable distance to watch other coverts upon this extensive tract of woodland manors had been roused just as he was retiring to rest by the same sharp shrill cry of distress i may say of anguish from poor chloe accompanied by beatings apparently much too violent for her strength against the door of his dwelling upon his answering her summons she instantly seized his coat and being well acquainted with her sagacity and her strong affection for her master he and his brother had followed her to the fifty acre coppice and there i mean the coppice where the woodcutters are at work added thomas in explanation there vre found the body what he woukl have said farther was interrupted by lucys falling down in a fainting fit from which she was with great difficulty recovered recovered only to hear of fresh horrors judicial enquiry soon led to the development of some circumstances which were suspicious only to professional acumen tracks and footmarks had been discovered which suddenly disappeared at the woodcutters cottage the elder prescott had been engaged during the previous day and still remained at some distant woods selecting and marking under the direction of an eminent surveyor the oak timber to be included in this years fall he was out of the question william besides the worn and harassed appearance of a man who had passed the night in tremendous crime or overwhelming misery presented the strange mixture of reserve and recklessness so often observed in great criminals circumstance upon circumstance combined to fix the guilt upon him and upon him only the remarkable tipped shoes whose marks had been traced from the corpse to the cottage which the village shoemaker and his neighbour the blacksmith both identified as ordered by himself were actually found upon his feet a jacket with stains which although partially washed out still bore traces of what the surgeon calledtoexamine the body recognised as the ineffectually removed marks of blood this jacket still wet and known by twenty persons as william prescotts usual dress was thrown carelessly in a comer and underneath it lay equally well known the axe whiche was accustomed to use inhis labour and which besides corresponding exactly with the wound on the head which had proved michael parrs deathblow retained ghastly evidence of the deed the gray hairs yet stack to the heft from the moment that the police officer held up the axe mute but eloquent accomplice of this awful deed the doubt and pity which had before accompanied the search throughout the cottage disappeared before the natural horror which such a crime awakened the accused took no means to revive or awaken more favourable feelings he sank upon the settle beside the hearth whose untended embers had been long extinguished in shivering silence and when handcuffed to one of the constables and roughly commanded to follow he seemed rather to obey the mechanical impulse of the man to whom he was linked than to apprehend the meaning of the words some amongst the villagers had observed the previous quarrel as well as the parting of the lovers and more dead than alive lucy obeyed a summons to the inquest in trembling silence and deaf from excess of nervous irritation tried vainly to hear and to comprehend the mild and soothing address of the official functionary looking up for that purpose she caught sight of william the expression of his countenance his attitude and the irons with which he was loaded told her at a glance the dreadful truth she listened to no questions she waited for no pause but shrieking with fearful rapidity he is innocent he is innocent beware how ye too commit murder she fell upon the floor in strong hysterics from that hour many weeks of fever and delirium passed away before she was restored to the agonizing consciousness that a verdict of wilful murder had been returned against william prescott this tragedy occurred just after the lent assizes had been holden at the county town so that the prisoner had the advantage of a considerable space of time in which to seek such testimony as might counterbalance the strong chain of circumstantial evidence upon which the verdict of the inquest had been founded and after the immediate and fierce indignation had subsided the usual reaction had taken place many began to balance the virtues of a life against the suspicions of an hour and offers were conveyed to the jail of whatever money might be needed to trace the real criminal calmly and thankfully were they declined without confessing the crime william prescott seemed resolved to abide the punishment even from one the dearest he had refused such proffers refused even to admit her to his cell it is strange annie said she as they were walking together on a balmy may evening when the sun almost level with the horizon shone upon a row of weeping birches that crowned a bank covered with gorse and broom the light magical in its effect tinting the silver bam and golden tassels of the lady of the woods with a fairy lustre that more than realized turners daintiest fancies it is passing strange that william seems to take as much pains to prevent his friends establishing his innocence as another might do to prevent the proof of guilt why if it were indeed the poachers whom our good aunt benham suspects why for them should he throw his life away since if he still persists in this silence the lawyers say that nothing can save him well continued she in the same calm and resigned tone in which she had hitherto spoken i shall not survive him long do not cry so dear annie in that certainty is my only comfort is ay dearest sister began annie when she was interrupted by a rustling on the other side of the bank accompanied by a renewal of that fearful barking never heard save on that fearful night from chloe the murdered keepers favourite dog a miserable man lean pallid unwashed unshaven ragged starved crawled forth scarcely resisting the attacks of chloe whose furious assaults were restrained with difficulty by the trembling girls and dragging himself to the feet of lucy demanded in a tone of agony as you would save a sinful soul tell me the truth and the whole truth if the murderer be not found must william die as surely as i stand here was the reply take me to the good dcar drag me before the magistrates let all the country hear me bring them hither before i die and he fell back as if already his last hour were come vol iii b this is what i have believed in my inmost heart said lucy ever since i have known that williams father had disappeared oh master prescott t said she as the old man upon whose pallid face annie had sprinkled cold water from a bright spring by the wayside was once more reviving oh master prescott clear if you can your innocent son i always knew that he was innocent the old man spoke with effort and difficulty we met that night in the coppice i had gone there to ascertain the girth of one particular tree he seized me pretending to take me for a poacher mocked me doavn spurned me being down and when i rose maddened by his insults the axe was in my hand and in my frenzy i struck at him as if i had been felling an oak then came my noble boy she dragged me away and made me promise not to surrender myself oh miss lucy bring witnesses bring officers to carry me to prison think if i should die without clearing my boy and that night the miserable father did die but not until before competent authorities he had established the innocence of his son e 2 who would give a bird the lie shakspeare i do not know whether in the list of organs which figure upon the skillmaps in the system of doctors gall and spnrz hei there be any which being translated for of a verity the language of phrenology needs translation would indicate a fondness for animals most assuredly if no such propensity be therein marked it is an important omission and should be supplied forthwith for that such an inclination does exist most strongly in numberless individuals of both sexes and is often developed under the most extraordinary disadvantages is as </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> as certain and far more frequent than the prodigies in music and painting in languages and in calculation the mozart the correggio the admirable crichton and american boys those wonders of learning of science and of art whose lives crowd our biographical dictionaries and whose heads as handed down in books and portraits form the triumph of the phrenologist separate from the fondness for animals generally and more distinctive and engrossing perhaps than any other species of that very engrossing propensity is the passion for birds boys are liable to it asa class and so they say is that particular order of single women ungallantly termed old maids it prevails a good deal incertain callings chiefly among sedentary artisans such as tailors shoemakers and hairdresser in provincial towns a barber in belford regis is amongst the most eminent fanciers of the profession and wins all the prizes at canaryshows for twenty miles round also the taste is apt to run in families descending from father to son through many generations ours for instance happens to be so distinguished my grandfather had an extensive aviary and was a celebrated breeder of the whole tribe of songbirds and his brother my granduncle is even now remembered as the first importer of the nightingale into northumberland he had two in cages which he kept for several years to the unspeakable delight of the neighbourhood who used to crowd around his hospitable door to listen to their matchless note one of the few celebrated things in the world which thoroughly deserves its reputation my dear father was no degenerate descendant of his birdloving progenitors how well i remember bis telling me under what circumstances be first went to the play when a little boy at a preparatory school at hexham a strolling company visited the town and being about to getup the padlock recommended i suppose by the fewness of the characters and in great distress for a bullfinch a property essential to leonoras song say little foolish fluttering thing whither ah whither would you wing your airy flight the manager having heard that he possessed a tame bullfinch came to him to request the loan which he granted with characteristic good humour and received in return from the grateful manager a free admittance for the season fancy the pride and delight of the boy in seeing his favourite figuring upon the stage and hearing the applause of the audience as he perched upon the prima donnas finger this must have been considerably above eighty years ago and for in this respect as well as in his general kindness the boy was father to the man the fancy remained all his life in full force and constant exercise there is scarcely any sort of bird that comes within the compass of moderate means which he has not possessed at one period or another once during the twenty years that we lived ina large countryhouse with its spacious lawn its extensive paddock and noble piece of water he assembled a great quantity of domestic game if such a phrase be admissible pretty speckled partridges too pretty to be eaten pheasants of all varieties from the splendid english bird to its eastern rivals the gold and the silver and a large assortment of waterfowl from the queenly swan down to the trim little dutch teal xing charles himself never had a more extensive collection or took greater delight in tending and cherishing his feathered subjects but these halfcivilized savages proved attractive to two orders of miscreants poachers pursued them by day and thieves by night and dead or alive shot or stolen the domesticated partridges and tame wild ducks gradually disappeared to them succeeded all manner of curious poultry peacocks pied and white together with that commoner but most gorgeous bird who flaunts his starry train over the grass and whose graceful vanity so becomes his stately beauty adorned our farmyard accompanied by muscovy ducks poland fowls friesland hens crested bantams and so forth then followed pigeons of all denominations fantails pouters carriers nuns and dragons crowded our dovecote but somehow or other our ill luck continued the poultry had a trick of dying and the pigeons flew away so that my father resolved to confine himself to the aviary and took to breeding canaries and had the honour of carrying away the prize for three birds of the three orthodox kinds jonque pied and mealy from nearly two hundred competitors long too long would it be to tell of all the smaller songsters the larks linnets thrushes and blackbirds the bullfinches goldfinches and all the finches of the grove as well as of the owls hawks crows and ravens the birds of day and the birds of night which have at different times occupied his attention suffice it to say that fifteen years last august our feathered family consisted of two nightingales one of which had been in our possession for sixteen months singing all day for in a cage the nightingale only sings during daylight with matchless strength and power from the first of october to the last of june a piping bullfinch a linnet two starlings and the magpie whose adventures and accomplishments form the subject of this true history amongst our infinite variety of feathered bipeds the class which in default of a better name i shall take leave to denominate talkingbirds had been upon the whole the most distinguished even i who partly on account of the tragical termination of many of our pets partly because i so dearly love freedom and the greenwood that all the hempseed and groundsel in the world would never i am sure reconcile me to a cage did not so heartily sympathise in this taste of my dear fathers as i did in most of his other pursuits even i albeit no bird fancier could not help being occasionally diverted by the saucy chattering jays starlings and jackdaws which it was the especial delight of that saucy chattering diverting personage master ben our factotum groom gardener page and jester to bring about the place preeminent over all other talkingbirds and unrivalled since the days of yetvert was the magpie in question he for a wonder was not of bens importing whence he came nobody knew although the old flycatcher who was also the parish sexton and whom he followed for a whole hour in the twilight as he was setting his traps to catch an underground enemy that infested my pansybeds alternately shouting to him by his name of peter tompkins in one ear and imitating the tolling of a bell in the other insinuated to me with a look of great horror that the fewer the questions asked upon that subject the better the creature certainly was no better than he should be nobody could tell for whom that bell would toll next and off shuffled poor peter fancying himself a doomed man for certain mags first appearance had been somewhat in character with the good sextons suspicions he had hopped down the walk and stopped opposite the glassdoor of our gardenroom where we were sitting with several friends and one amongst them happened to inquire the hour whats oclock reiterated mag in a soft slow distinct voice halfpast four and upon consulting watches and that very true timeteller the sun as he threw his beams upon the old dial halfpast four it was and everybody stared at the bird as he stood upon one leg with his head a little on one side looking very knowing and exceedingly ragged and dirty as your tame magpie is apt to do everybody stared at the bird and laughed and said that it was a strange coincidence as everybody does say upon such occasions mags further proceedings were in keeping with his oracular entree a saucy biid he was and a mischievous singing whistling sneezing coughing blowing his nose laughing crying knocking at doors ringing at bells thieving and hiding with singular dexterity he caught up and repeated with remarkable facility all that was said and really seemed as if he understood its purport for instance i one day said to him mag if you bite my finger i will never give you any more fruit or sugar and although i regularly did feed him every day with sugar and fruit mine were the only fingers in the house that remained unbeaten he certainly too could apply names to their right owners one of his great delights was to summon all the servants about him sometimes in his own soft distinct tone sometimes by imitating with a wonderful cleverness my voice or his masters ben john martha lucy marianne and when he had got them all around him go he would say go to and when everybody was expecting something as naughty as yetvert would have said after his voyage in the coche deau had contaminated his manners he would suddenly break into a laugh </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> laugh and finish his sentence with go to jerusalem go to jerusalem he never failed to call over this beadroll of names at least once aday and if the wrong person answered lucy for marianne or martha for lucy he would stamp his little foot and scold and storm and refuse to be pacified until the offender begged pardon and asked him to begin his catalogue again sometimes he added the dogs to the list and the greyhounds a simple credulous innocent race readily answered to his call once and but once he took in my lamented flush a beautiful little brown cocking spaniel a greater pet even than himself and infinitely more sagacious flush said mag with an imitation of my voice that was even startling and flush who was looking forward to our evening walk threw down his hone and ran to answer the summons flush repeated mag in the same tone with a nod and a laugh in my life i never saw such a mixture of shame and anger as my beautiful pets large bright eyes exhibited mag tried the trick again but it failed the perfect good faith of the gentle and faithful little creature who never deceiving could not suspect deceit had enabled the knavish bird to cheat him once but the imposition once detected became so far as flush was concerned altogether powerless nevertheless there was no resisting a certain degree of liking for the poor bird whose tricks of drollery for every day he came out with something fresh really seemed inexhaustible he had a cage to which being generally fed there he frequently retired of his own free will one day however he was missing that tongue of his was a thing to be missed just as the near neighbours of a mill or church steeple would soon feel the absence of the clapper and the chimes he had left the premises more than once before and had led ben and john a dance amongst all the trees and cottages of aberleigh appearing and disappearing now on the ground and now on the housetop playing at bopeep among the roofs and chimneys in a manner more provoking than words can tell so that ben after fairly lodging his new straw hat on the branches of a peartree from the topmost bough of which mag swinging much at his ease had thought fit to hail him with his usual how d ye do master ben had fairly given up the chase in despairs once twice thrice had mag eloped but then the tricksy spirit had never failed to make itself audible and even when upon one occasion he had absented himself for one entire night he had taken care to reappear in the morning at bens bedroom window with his usual tap tap against the glass and the grave businesslike summons past six oclock ben time to get up wherewith he was wont as regularly as the clock struck to awaken that trusty domestic only the tuesday before mag had been absent for a longer period than common but directed by a singular noise of fierce and angry jabbering something like the scolding of a woman in a passion he had been discovered in a field at the bottom of the garden engaged in a furious disputation with two wild birds of his own species earnestly defending a bare and dirty bone his own property doubtless fiom the incursions of these intruders that made had fought with other weapons than his tongue and been worsted that he was very glad when our approach frightened away his opponents was quite plain but they being gone he gladly followed us home in the opposite direction and had up to this unfortunate friday for it was upon this day of ill luck that we missed our poor bird conducted himself with a degree of prudence and discretion that showed him to have taken warning by his contest and discomfiture on that friday however he was missing from noon to night the next morning dawned six oclock struck but no magpie tapped at the window to call ben he was neither in the house or the garden on the trees or the chimneys that the poor bird was lost seemed indisputable and so strong was the general impression of his attachment to us and of his sagacity that we were pretty generally convinced that he must have been stolen who might be the thief was not so easy to determine aberleigh is situated upon a wellfrequented road leading from one great town to another and our cottage stood in the centre of the village street moreover holding a sort of middle station between the gently to whom we belonged by birth and habits and old associations and the countrypeople almost our equals in fortune who all resorted to my dear father for advice and assistance in their little difficulties there was scarcely a person within ten miles who did not occasionally pay a visit to our habitation then bens acquaintance gardeners gamekeepers cricketers grooms ben knew the whole country and although it would be rather too affronting to suspect ones friends and acquaintances of thievery yet they amongst whom the magpie was deservedly popular had of course contributed to diffuse its reputation on that unlucky friday too we had had even more visitors than common two or three sets of people had come fiom london by railway five or six neighbouring families had called the coursingseason was coming on and twj or three brace of greyhounds had been bought by their respective owners to be compared with our dogs a flowershow was approaching and halfadozen gardeners had been backward and forward amongst zinnias and dahlias a cricketmatch was pending and the greater part of the two elevens had come to arrange the day and the hour one constable had arrived for orders to send ois an encampment of gipsies who had established themselves in woodcock lane and another had come for a warrant to take up a party of vagrants caught in the fact of poaching and suspected of sheepstealing at ilintondoaai who was the thief was still a mystery but when day after day passed over and no tidings arrived of our bird that he was stolen became the firm conviction of our whole family sorry however as we were for the merry saucy little creature whose spirit of enjoyment and activity of intellect seemed so disproportioned to his diminutive form and his low rank in the scale of living beings still the recollection began to wear array and when at the expiration of a week we sallied forth to pahtake of a dejeuner in the beautiful grounds of aberleigh great house our domestic calamity was to say the truth pretty nearly forgotten never was a more delightful little party than assembled by the side of the clear brimming loddon on a glorious afternoon near the end of august the day was so sultry that the tables were laid under some magnificent elms upon the lawn forming nth its adjuncts of picturesque architecture of exquisite scenery of lovelyyoung women and thrice lovely children a picture of gay and courtly elegance worthy of watteau the dejeuner however sumptuous and luxurious as it was formed by no means the chief attraction of the day under the long lofty terrace crowned with old firs and limetrees which forms the boundary of aberleigh park the loddon spreading for nearly a mile into an almost lake like expanse rivals the thames in consequence whilst it far surpasses it in beauty and then narrowing as it is spanned by the low arches of the bridge glides along amongst quiet watermeadows with a pastoral seclusion and tranquillity which would have enchanted izaak walton a row up this bright river was the express intention of the party and accordingly the grand question of oars or sculls being decided water baled out rowlocks and howls examined we set forth in three as pretty skiffs as may be seen between battersea and putney bridge ourselves as men and happy a set of people as are often assembled in this workaday world some were sailors one especially most worthy of that honoured name which is the synonym of all that is frank and kind and truehearted in man and one who by some mistake in destiny is not really a sailor but who possesses all the attributes and almost the skill some were sailors some were soldiers some gentlemen at large but the charm of the party was felt to be the freight of one of the boats consisting of four lovely young women singing like nightingales and as it seemed from the same impulse of a full and joyous heart who went backward and forward upon the water spreading abroad melody as the sun diffuses light or the roses their perfume that craft was naturally looked to as the one fiom which we should </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> should derive most pleasure but we hardly on embarking anticipated the kind of amusement which it was destined to afford it so happened that one of their rowers was accidentally detained and another compelled to take the management of the boat containing the children so that our pretty congresses fell to the charge of one solitary boatman who taking care that no real harm should befal them seemed to find some diversion in plunging them and himself into small difficulties and the rudder being unshipped they so to say staggered about upon the water as if the boat were tipsy now running aground upon an island now taking a snag to borrow a phrase cmtent upon the mississippi now caught by veil and bonnet in the bushes upon one bank now entangled in the sedges upon the other until the syrens of the loddon half frightened and halfamused mixed screams and squalls with the sweet strains of the canadian boatsong and shrieks of laughter with a boat a boat unto the ferry after shooting the bridge matters grew worse they had sailed from harbour so loni before our boat that we had hitherto only looked and laughed at the strange tacks voluntary and iu voluntary which their skiff had taken but now gallantly manned and ably steered we shot ahead of them drowning testator del onde by such a torrent of river wit as shall not be exceeded from gravesend to kew at last when amid laughing and singing and quiet enjoyment the mists were rising in the meadows and the moon looking down into that bright miitor the still smooth stream we took our fair damsels in tow and prepared to return homeward looking upas we were about to shoot the centre arch of the bridge i saw a strange vaga baptising gipsy sort of light cart that looked as if it had never paid any duty passing above it and while our mermaids were singing with a delightful unity of their young voices oft in the stilly night ere slumbers chain has bound me they would have added but that charm was broken by a wellknown voice from above which pronounced with startling distinctness go go go to jerusalem was it my magpie or was it his wiaith of course by night a good mile fioui our landingplace and then a mile back again to the bridge all search or enquiry was hopeless i told the story when i got home and found the whole village divided in opinion some thought with me that the gipsies lead hold of him some with my father that he had been stolen by the more regular thieves some thought that it was a trick some that it was a mistake aud some held with peter tompkins that the magpie was no magpie after all but an incarnation of the evil one in black and white plumage again was poor mag forgotten as one bright september morning we set forth towards farnham a pretty oldfashioned town overlooked by the bishops palace with its stately trees and extensive park and famous for its hopgardens and for mr garths geraniums where in one small greenhouse he rivals in splendour although not in extent mr fosters exquisite collection and equals him in hospitality and kindness it is something remarkable i think something pleasant as well as remarkable and peculiar to our age and country that two english gentlemen should surpass by the mere effect of taste and skill the efforts of the working gardeners whose livelihood depends upon their flowers with the strong stimulus of desire of gain on the one hand and the enormous resources of wealth as lavished in the greenhouses of our great noblemen on the other to raise a magnificent geranium is to increase and multiply beauty and to strengthen and diffuse the feeling of the beautiful in this workaday world ait herself does little more the road from aberleigh to farnham passes through very pretty and very interesting scenery we leave stratified and winchester emblems of the present and the past to the right and sir john copes magnificent old mansion of branchial and the parsonage at heckfield adhere mrs trollope passed her early days to the left then we pass through a succession of wild woodland country to the little town of odium plunging again into forestlike glades until we cross a high barren heathy ridge called the hogs back the view from the top of which forms a superb and extensive panorama descending this long steep and lofty hill we find ourselves once more amidst cultivation quaint oldfashioned villages sunk deep in the valley and patches of hopgardens intersecting the fields the hopgatherers were busy in taking down and stripping the long poles the english vintage and the lines hung like garlands in rich tvteaths of leaves and flowers intertwined one with another and diffusing around the bitter racy aroma of the fragrant plant dear to the lovers of mighty ale a pretty scene it was and a stirring we stopped the carriage at the gate to view it more closely and listen to the gay jests and merriment of the many groups collected in the ground there is something contagious in real hearty mirth and ben our driver without knowing why joined in the laugh apparently his peculiar laughter was recognised for in a moment we heard from the other side of the gate ben how d ye do ben glad to see you master ben go to jerusalem in mags most triumphant tones and this time we did not hear in vain ave recovered our bird and long we possessed him happiest sauciest and most sagacious of magpies thy greyhounds are as swift as breathed stags shakespeare nothing can be more striking than the yild and uncultivated aspect of the country the scanty sprinkling of towns and villages and the primitive manners and appearance of the scattered inhabitants which may occasionally be found within some fifty miles of the crowded sophisticated metropolis and almost within ken of that mighty engine of civilization that mighty annihilate of time and space a railroad how long this happy state of things for to those who delight in rural sights and sounds and dread the day when london and its suburbs shall quite stretch fiom seato sea a happy day it is how long this pleasant anomaly may continue i am not rash enough to prophesy but at this present writing with the clock on the stroke of twelve and the chilly windy frosty nineteenth of january stealing into a twentieth chillier winder and frontier still at this fingernipping cold catching beginning of the year of grace 185 i could point out half a dozen tracts of heath and woodland as free from the contamination of city smoke or city finery as the mountains of wales or the highlands of scotland the spot however with which we are more immediately concerned is a district vol iii t of oxfordshire divided from the gay and populous county of berks and the busy thriving town of belford regis by one of the most beautiful boundaries in her majestys dominions the broad translucent thames jso sooner have we passed the long straggling bridge and left the river and its pretty village behind than the roads become narrow and rugged the banks shelving and broken the hills abrupt and precipitous the groves and woods by the way side expand into shaggy heaths sinking into rude dells and backed by antique forests and the whole scenery assumes the wild and sylvan character of an old english chase in early summer when these commons dotted by clumps of holly and hawthorn and dimpled with glittering pools are bordered by their deep beech woods shining in the tender green of their young leaves the irregular belt varied here and there by some huge cherry tree starting from the verdant mass and covered with myriads of snowy blossoms the ground beneath carpeted with wild flowers from the rarest orchis to the commonest daisy it is a pleasure of pleasures to dally in those fragrant paths and penetrate to the utmost depth of those mossgrown recesses nor is the scene less beautiful in the still clearness of an october noon when the first frost has given a golden tinge to the foliage of the beech whilst the cherry trees have assumed that indescribable richness of colouring which seems as if the fast falling leaves had been dyed in the rosy juice of the fruit the boasted brightness of the american fall can scarcely exceed the vivid hues of the oxfordshire cherry country after the earliest frosts of an english autumn it is not however the lover of nature only who delights in this wild district t 2 the sportsman

open country becoming wilder and more open with every mile the absence of hedgerows enchanted his eye and the bleak wind as having surmounted the wanton edges he looked fairly across the valley to hatherton hill never failed to gladden his heart atherton hill being next perhaps to compton bottom the best place for trying a greyhound in england the very newmarket of coursers into wonder that the finding themselves on the road to this place of delight some twenty years ago should exhilarate the spirits of two young country lads who driving a spirited horse in a light open carriage and having charge of two or three brace of dogs belonging to a master who had gone an hour or two before to enjoy a few days coursing with an intimate friend conceived themselves amongst the happiest and most important of all human beings the happiness was pretty equally shared the importance by no means so one of the pair by name master ben being the real groom valet man of all work factotum and what not to whom was delegated the charge of carnage horse and dog whilst his comrade who boasted the euphonious appellation of tom was only a deputys deputy hired for the nonce moreover ben was eighteen and thought himself a man a mistake into which tom younger by two years and shorter by two inches could hardly fall ben had a new jacket tom an old one ben had halfasovereign in his pocket tom halfacrown een was a courser and had been at hatherton whilst tom had not only never visited that classic ground of all sportsmen but had actually never seen a greyhound run in his life to do ben justice he did all he could to enlighten toms ignorance at which he thought himself much scandalised though whether like many a greater man he might not find some consolation in so fair an opportunity of laying down the law upon the subject without risk of question maybe doubted at all events whatever could be done by talking of coursing from the traditions of the late lord riverss kennel the some time monarch of that princely sport to descriptions of mr godlikes his successor in skill in spirit and in success ben performed con amove and between eulogium upon all the principal dogs with historical accounts of their different matches and biographies of their several trainers mixed with certain prophecies respecting the success of their own stud to follow literally the grandiose phrase of the lecturer especially a yellow bitch called marigold in talk like this diversified with occasional digressions respecting the good cheer of the house to which they were bound and a few hints respecting a blackeyed dairymaid who seemed to rival marigold in bens regard the time sped pleasantly along ben had talking to keep him warm and tom had novelty and anticipation and the indomitable spirit of enjoyment of a country boy upon his first journey sitting in a gentlemans carriage and behind a gentlemans horse less happily engrossed they might have been to find that the decembers night was closing in raw and cold and that when after climbing up a steep ascent they again got into the phaeton the wind which met them on the top blew so fiercely as to render walking if the less dignified by very far the pleasantness mode of progress matters were not mended when the shelving craggy banks picturesquely clothed with wood which had hitherto skirted the road disappeared and they found themselves on a wide open common of a very irregular surface with the young moon just showing her slender face in a drearylooking piece of water at some distance and no shelter of any sort visible sofar as they could see the mind blew colder and colder the very dogs instead of keeping as they had hitherto done at the side of the carriage seemed shrinking behind marigold p cried ben mf/rtle maf/ fljj manhood whew marigold then whew ew ew i and ben uttered the shrill prolonged whistle peculiar and individual as an autograph with which he had been wont to summon his favourite whew ew ew resounded from the bottom of the hill ben was no coward and the days of ghosts are over besides who ever heard of a ghost whistling nevertheless he was a little startled and when tom professing to believe it an echo drily desired him to try it again an injunction which he mechanically obeyed the whistle had so to say a shake which if it could have been executed at will would have had considerable value in a musical point of view its a great pity that mere letterpress can give no idea of the sound but although we must fail in the delineation yet a most exact copy did arise this time from midway up the hill continuing at intervals mixed with slight variations until at length a small figure with the whole pack of missing dogs scampering around him appeared at the top of the ascent and tom for the hero of the whistle had stopped the horse from more motives probably than he could easily have enumerated exclaimed in a tone between amazement and disappointment why its only little david after all only david rejoined ben giving vent to another half whistle checked pretty hastily as the effect of the last glanced over his recollection david why it really is that little rascal and the wretched pigmy of an animal that marigold is tossing over and over can be nothing but his dog spider i knew that he was dying to come but to see him here twenty miles fiom home with eight good miles before us before we get to a house and he all in rags and without a farthing in his pocket poor tatterdemallion to pay for a bed ora supper when we do get to hatherton hang it tom theres spunk in the little creatures is not there suppose we take him on with us eh master likes his pluck and hell be useful to help hold the dogs here you sir jump up here cant you how came you to bring that dwarfish cur of yours with you do you think weare going to course rats and mice or to run against spaniels and teniers or for the matter of that how came you here yourself get in i say jump and with a sly whistle ostensibly addressed to the greyhounds in general and to spick and marigold in particular but into which in spite of his gratitude for eens condescension he could not resist the temptation of infusing some slight reminiscence of the abovementioned shake little david did jump into the phaeton and animated by their past adventure nothing is pleasant than a brief puzzle with the least dash in the world of a flight when once it is happily over the three drove on in tenfold glee little david dwarf and tatterdemallion as ben had justly called him was a wellknown and to say the truth a popular inhabitant of our good village of aberleigh the poor boy was an orphan and how old he was who were his parents or to whom they being dead he might be said to belong were questions which nobody gave themselves the trouble to ask whether he had such a superfluity as a surname was doubtful i question whether he knew it himself or whether it had ever occurred to him to make the enquiry little david was distinction enough for him all that was known of his history was that he had been placed by some longpast overseer with an old parish nurse and that when the vestry claimed him as a denizen of the workhouse dame butler a lonely and childless woman had become so strongly attached to the friendless boy that she refused to part with him and in spite of the remonstrances of the parish authorities and the still more urgent pinching of poverty and age had contrived to support him until he could earn his own living wonderfully soon did that happen david vindicated the affection of his protectress by his industry and good conduct when other children are hardly trusted to take care of their own limbs he began to be useful in their little menage and whilst the other brats of the village were thinking of nothing but getting into mischief and out of scrapes he was already watching sheep driving pigs and keeping birds from the corn for the farmers milking cows feeding poultry and chuitiing butter for their wives helping now in the wheelwrights shop now in the ropeyard now at the forge tending the curates flowers holding the vicars horse and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> and running errands for everybody xever was so trusty or so alert an assistant never since the time of puek and really david was not much bigger than the popular notion of that esprit fillets was so vivacious or so diligent a little messenger no opportunity of turning a penny in an honest way came amiss to him and by the time he was as high to use bens mode of mensuration as marigold shoulder at which time he might by a rough computation be about eleven years old he had fairly repaid dame butlers kindness by earning nearly enough not merely for his own subsistence but for hers of all his ways of winning money however that in which david most delighted was the hard work called sporting which to that half of the world which calls itself the wiser sex has a fascination so universal that it must in them as in the nobler races of animals who minister to the passion be inborn and intuitive when still in feminine habiliments and little bigger than a fullgrown infant it occuitcd to david then exerting himself as aidedecamp to a tall scarecrow in frightening the birds fioni a field of wheat to see in a water furrow a hare on her form the field was by the roadside een alreadyknown to the urchin by sight and name happened to pass the boy pointed to the hare ben galloped ofi to fetch his master and the dogs a fine run was the consequence and the love of the sport never from that hour flagged or dwindled in davids bosom as soon as he was old enough to keep up with the party he was employed to lead the dogs to help the spaniels in beating hedges to find hares sitting lq short to form one of the busy joyous train called a coursing party and he soon became as well acquainted with the greyhounds and nearly as good a judge of their various merits as ben himself by accident he had even become possessed of a greyhound in his own person one evening in the spring preceding the date of our story a poor scared halfstarved creature apparently only two or three months old was driven by some idle boys into a small court in front of dame butlers cottage david tenderhearted to all animals rated the children and called the frightened trembling puppy ina tone which with the remarkable instinct by which dogs at once recognize their friends the poor little thing immediately obeyed the remains of a basket were about her neck she had evidently escaped from some coach or railway and wandered about probably for days after having satisfied his conscience by making inquiries at belford david attached to his foundling the first living thing he had ever called his own from the sense of benefit conferred and the poor creatures fond gratitude prevailed with some difficulty on his good old grumbling nurse to receive spider by which exceedingly plebeian name he chose to designate her as an inmate never were dog and master better proportioned to each other spider was far more like an italian than an english greyhound and dwarfed probably by her early misadventure did really seem fitter as ben said to purse rats and mice and such small deer than to run after a fuu groti hare and as to permitting him to try her speed against marigold a presumptuous wish which david had been rash enough to hint at the thing was too derogatory to be thought of it would be like matching a shetland pony against a racehorse it was not even without many rebukes for bringing such a lapdog and many injunctions to remember that he must make everybody understand that spider did not belong to our stud that ben vol iii u suffered david to bring his lapdog the most injurious name that he could think of along with them he even snubbed tom for venturing to assert that she would be pretty if she were rather bigger to all which contumelies little david who had received many kindnesses from ben to say nothing of the present cast made no worse answer than a whistle brightly shone the son on hatherton hill when on the second morning after their journey horse and dog and man properly rested and refreshed sallied forth for a long days diversion it was a gay and gallant sight the hospitable host surrounded by his own line family his troops of friends and train of grooms and keepers upon that magnificent eminence forming a panorama for extent and for historical interest such as shall hardly be pardoned in the south of england and the sport was worthy of the scene never were such hares never were such dogs marigold beat nestor and ben was beside himself and little david who had never before seen coursing upon the downs david was crazy it seemed incredible that so much noise for to the honour of coursing be it said there is no noisier pastime could come from so small a body at last after host and guest had been alternately victor and vanquished in the friendly strife and after some half dozen of the neighbouring gentlemen had also breathed their greyhounds an event occurred which put an unexpected and most unintended check to the gaiety of the meeting sir john firewood one of the greatest coursers in england who was known to be on a visit to a neighbouring nobleman suddenly appeared attended by a vast retinue of trainers and grooms and dogboys and a stud of some twenty brace of greyhounds and advancing most courteously to the party hoping that he should not be considered as an intruder if he preferred a request to try the speed of one or two of his dogs against some of those present there was one which he particularly wished to try against the fleetest that could be found as he intended to run him the next week for the cup at hertford inn and another that had just won the goblet at swaffham if any gentleman would favour him with slipping a good dog against one of these he should think himself much honoured whew quoth ben ben was dumbfounded and to say the truth his betters were rather taken aback something one muttered about marigold having cut herself and another about nestor having already run two courses and the lord of the manor was about to couple a most courteous refusal of the challenge with a request that sir john would run as many of his own dogs upon the hill as he chose when to the unutterable astonishment of the whole field little david led spider upto the training groom and boldly proposed to run her against the dog who was about to be entered at hertford inn whew ew wl quoth ben with redoubled energy the groom a tall man mounted upon a tall horse looked down upon david with the sort of scornful astonishment with which the giant may be supposed to have eyed the noted jack of the nursery legend and vouchsafed no reply but his master a thoroughly welltempered and kindly person after enquiring to whom the pretty little creature belonged and hearing from davids chief patron and protector the story of the boy and his dog ordered harebrain between whom and spider there was nearly the same disproportion as between the groom and her master to be put into the slips whew 1 said ben again shes really pretty if she should beat now david and she belong to our party its only right to back em up hark ye you sir upon the great horse ill bet you half a crown upon the little un shouted he as a hare being found they were led to a bottom which as the hare was sure to make for the steep ascent was peculiarly favourable to the smaller dog done responded the tall groom grinning has any one else a mind fora bet or will you venture another half crown comrade no said ben who indeed had only made this bet in a spirit of good fellowship by way of encouragement to david and protection to a dog who came with his party no more bets thank ye ah shes off now spider i sow harehrain / shouted the grooms and dogboys but not long did they shout harehrain used to the slips and eager for the sport had been nearly a yard ahead at first starting but the bitch had passed him like lightning strained up the hill side gained upon the dog at every stride and had finally turned and killed her hare without harebraircs coming in for a turn whew ew ew quoth ben i beg your pardon david for doubting the bitch shes a good un sure enough and im half a crown richer than i thought i </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> i was dont go mad about it though david nor dont eat spider up it must be all accident cried the training groom after honourably disbursing bens money have you a mind to run her again my little man double or quits sir ay ay i cried david ay ay said ben the latter worthy was however about to demur a little when instead of the candidate for the cup at hertford inn he found them slipping the winner of the swaffham goblet but david stopped him let her run their best said he youll see shell beat them and beat them she did after a longer course and a more decided triumph and sir john won the cup after all not indeed with barebrain but with spider alias ffelerij whom he purchased of her master at so high a rate that little david returned to aberleigh a moneyed

public the most secret history of many of the transactions is laid bare it is not possible ta conceive contemporary history more completely exemplified from such materials it was not possible to form a work that would not possess the very highest interest the duke of buckingham has however moulded his materials with no ordinary ability and skill the connecting narrative is written both with judgment and vigour not unfrequently in a style that comes up to the highest order of historical compositionspecially in some of the sketches of personal character there is scarcely a single
