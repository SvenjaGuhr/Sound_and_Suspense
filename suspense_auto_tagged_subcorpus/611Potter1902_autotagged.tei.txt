mrs rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> went through the wood to the bakers she bought a loaf </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> loaf of brown bread and five currant buns flopsy mopsy and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> and cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> lane to gather blackberries but peter who was very naughty ran </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> ran straight away to mr mcgregors garden and squeezed under the </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> the gate first he ate some lettuces and some french beans </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> beans and then he ate some radishes and then feeling rather </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> rather sick he went to look for some parsley but round </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> round the end of a cucumber frame whom should he meet </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> meet but mr mcgregor mr mcgregor was on his hands and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> and ran after peter waving a rake and calling out stop </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> stop thief peter was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> to the gate he lost one of his shoes among the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes after losing </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> so that i think he might have got away altogether if </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net and </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket it </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new peter </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> exert himself mr mcgregor came up with a sieve which he </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> he intended to pop upon the top of peter but peter </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> peter wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket behind him </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> him and rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> can it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> in if it had not had so much water in it </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> it mr mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot he began to </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> to turn them over carefully looking under each presently peter sneezedkertyschoo </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> sneezedkertyschoo mr mcgregor was after him in no time and tried </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> tried to put his foot upon peter who jumped out of </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> of a window upsetting three plants the window was too small </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> small for mr mcgregor and he was tired of running after </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> after peter he went back to his work peter sat down </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> with fright and he had not the least idea which way </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> way to go also he was very damp with sitting in </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> in that can after a time he began to wander about </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> about going lippitylippitynot very fast and looking all round he found </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> found a door in a wall but it was locked and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> to squeeze underneath an old mouse was running in and out </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> out over the stone doorstep carrying peas and beans to her </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> her family in the wood peter asked her the way to </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> to the gate but she had such a large pea in </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> in her mouth that she could not answer she only shook </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> shook her head at him peter began to cry then he </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> he tried to find his way straight across the garden but </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> but he became more and more puzzled presently he came to </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> to a pond where mr mcgregor filled his watercans a white </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very very </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> very still but now and then the tip of her tail </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense2> tail twitched as if it were alive peter thought it best </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> best to go away without speaking to her he had heard </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> heard about cats from his cousin little benjamin bunny he went </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> went back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> him he heard the noise of a hoescrrritch scratch scratch scritch </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> scritch peter scuttered underneath the bushes but presently as nothing happened </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> peeped over the first thing he saw was mr mcgregor hoeing </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> hoeing onions his back was turned towards peter and beyond him </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> him was the gate peter got down very quietly off the </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> go along a straight walk behind some blackcurrant bushes mr mcgregor </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner but peter did </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> did not care he slipped underneath the gate and was safe </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> safe at last in the wood outside the garden mr mcgregor </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds peter never stopped running or </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> or looked behind him till he got home to the big </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> big firtree he was so tired that he flopped down upon </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbithole </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> rabbithole and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking she </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> peter had lost in a fortnight i am sorry to say </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> say that peter was not very well during the evening his </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> his mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> tea and she gave a dose of it to peter one </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> one tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime but flopsy mopsy and
