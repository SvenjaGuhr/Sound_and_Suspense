<chapter>chapter i bred up in luxurious indolence i was surrounded by friends who seemed to have no business in this world but to save me the trouble of thinking or acting for myself and i was confirmed in the pride of helplessness by being continually reminded that i was the only son and heir of the earl of glenthorn my mother died a few weeks after i was born and i lost my father when i was very young i was left to the care of a guardian who in hopes of winning my affection never controlled my wishes or even my whims i changed schools and masters as often as i pleased and consequently learned nothing at last i found a private tutor who suited me exactly for he was completely of my own opinion that every thing which the young earl of glenthorn did not know by the instinct of genius was not worth his learning money could purchase a reputation for talents and with money i was immoderately supplied for my guardian expected to bribe me with a part of my own fortune to forbear inquiring what had become of a certain deficiency in the remainder this tacit compact i perfectly understood we were consequently on the most amicable terms imaginable and the most confidential for i thought it better to deal with my guardian than with jews thus at an age when other young men are subject to some restraint either from the necessity of their circumstances or the discretion of their friends i became completely master of myself and of my fortune my companions envied me but even their envy was not sufficient to make me happy whilst yet a boy i began to feel the dreadful symptoms of that mental malady which baffles the skill of medicine and for which wealth can purchase only temporary alleviation for this complaint there is no precise english name but alas the foreign term is now naturalized in england among the higher classes whether in </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> in the wealthy or the fashionable world who is unacquainted with ennui at first i was unconscious of being subject to this disease i felt that something was the matter with me but i did not know what yet the symptoms were sufficiently marked i was afflicted with frequent fits of fidgeting yawning and stretching with a constant restlessness of mind and body an aversion to the place i was in or the thing i was doing or rather to that which was passing before my eyes for i was never doing any thing i had an utter abhorrence and an incapacity of voluntary exertion unless roused by external stimulus i sank into that kind of apathy and vacancy of ideas vulgarly known by the name of a brown study if confined in a room for more than half an hour by bad weather or other contrarieties i would pace backwards and forwards like the restless cavia in his den with a fretful unmeaning pertinacity i felt an insatiable longing for something new and a childish love of locomotion my physician and my guardian not knowing what else to do with me sent me abroad i set out upon my travels in my eighteenth year attended by my favourite tutor as my companion we perfectly agreed in our ideas of travelling we hurried from place to place as fast as horses and wheels and curses and guineas could carry us milord anglois rattled over half the globe without getting one inch farther from his ennui three years were to be consumed before i should be of age what sums did i spend during this interval in expeditionmoney to time but the more i tried to hasten him the slower the rogue went i lost my money and my temper at last the day for which i had so long panted arrivedi was twentyone and i took possession of my estate the bells rang the bonfires blazed the tables were spread the wine flowed huzzas resounded friends and tenants crowded about me and nothing but the voice of joy and congratulation was to be heard the bustle of my situation kept me awake for some weeks the pleasure of property was new and as long as the novelty lasted delightful i cannot say that i was satisfied but my mind was distended by the sense of the magnitude of my possessions i had large estates in england and in one of the remote maritime counties of ireland i was lord over an immense territory annexed to the ancient castle of glenthorna noble pile of antiquity worth ten degenerate castles of modern days it was placed in a bold romantic situation at least as far as i could judge of it by a picture said to be a striking likeness which hung in my hall at sherwood park in england i was born in ireland and nursed as i was told in an irish cabin for my father had an idea that this would make me hardy he left me with my irish nurse till i was two years old and from that time forward neither he nor i ever revisited ireland he had a dislike to that country and i grew up in his prejudices i declared that i would always reside in england sherwood park my english countryseat had but one fault it was completely finished the house was magnificent and in the modern taste the furniture fashionably elegant and in all the gloss of novelty not a single luxury omitted not a fault could be found by the most fastidious critic my park my grounds displayed all the beauties of nature and of art judiciously combined majestic woods waving their dark foliage overhungbut i will spare my readers the description for i remember falling asleep myself whilst a poet was reading to me an ode on the beauties of sherwood park these beauties too soon became familiar to my eye and even the idea of being the proprietor of this enchanting place soon palled upon my vanity every casual visitor all the strangers even the common people who were allowed once a week to walk in my pleasuregrounds enjoyed them a thousand times more than i could i remember that about six weeks after i came to sherwood park i one evening escaped from the crowds of friends who filled my house to indulge myself in a solitary melancholy walk i saw at some distance a party of people who were coming to admire the place and to avoid meeting them i took shelter under a fine tree the branches of which hanging to the ground concealed me from the view of passengers thus seated </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> seated i was checked in the middle of a desperate yawn by hearing one among the party of strangers exclaiming how happy the owner of this place must be yes had i known how to enjoy the goods of life i might have been happy but want of occupation and antipathy to exertion rendered me one of the most miserable men upon earth still i imagined that the cause of my discontent proceeded from some external circumstance soon after my coming of age business of various sorts required my attention papers were to be signed and lands were to be let these things appeared to me terrible difficulties not even that minister of state who so feelingly describes his horror at the first appearance of the secretary with the great portfolio ever experienced sensations so oppressive as mine were when my steward began to talk to me of my own affairs in the peevishness of my indolence i declared that i thought the pains overbalanced the pleasures of property captain crawley a frienda sort of a frienda humble companion of mine a gross unblushing thoroughgoing flatterer happened to be present when i made this declaration he kindly undertook to stand between me and the shadow of trouble i accepted this offer ay crawley said i do see and settle with these people i had not the slightest confidence in the person into whose hands to save myself from the labour of thinking i thus threw all my affairs but i satisfied my understanding by resolving that when i should have leisure i would look out for an agent upon whom i could depend i had now been nearly two months at sherwood park too long a time i thought to remain in any place and i was impatient to get away my steward who disliked the idea of my spending my summers at home found it easy to persuade me that the water on my estate had a brackish unwholesome taste the man who told me this stood before me in perfect health though he had drunk this insalubrious water all his life but it was too laborious a task for my intellects to compare the evidence of my different senses and i found it most easy to believe what i heard though it was in direct opposition to what i saw away i hurried to a wateringplace after the example of many of my noble contemporaries who leave their delightful countryseats to pay by the inch for being squeezed up in lodginghouses with all imaginable inconvenience during the hottest months in summer i whiled away my time at brighton cursing the heat of the weather till the winter came and then cursing the cold and longing for the london winter the london winter commenced and the young earl of glenthorn and his entertainments and his equipages and extravagance were the conversation of all the world and the joy of the newspapers the immense cost of the fruit at my desserts was recorded the annual expense of the vast nosegays of hothouse flowers worn daily by the footmen who clung behind my coach was calculated the hundreds of wax lights which burned nightly in my house were numbered by the idle admirers of folly and it was known by every body that lord glenthorn suffered nothing but wax to be burned in his stables that his servants drank nothing but claret and champagne that his liveries surpassing the imagination of ambassadors vied with regal magnificence whilst their golden trappings could have stood even the test of chinese curiosity my coachmakers bill for this year if laid before the public would amuse and astonish soberminded people as much as some charges which have lately appeared in our courts of justice for extraordinary coaches and very extraordinary landaus i will not enter into the detail of my extravagance in minor articles of expense these i thought could never be felt by such a fortune as that of the earl of glenthorn but for the information of those who have the same course to run or to avoid i should observe that my diurnal visits to jewellers shops amounted in time to sums worth mentioning of the multitude of baubles that i bought the rings the seals the chains i will give no account it would pass the belief of man and the imagination of woman those who have the least value for their time have usually the greatest number of watches and are the most anxious about the exactness of their going i and my repeaters were my own plagues and the profit of all the fashionable watchmakers whose shops i regularly visited for a lounge my history </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> history at this period would be a complete loungers journal but i will spare my readers this diary i wish however as i have had ample experience to impress it on the minds of all whom it may concern that a lounger of fortune must be extravagant i went into shops merely to pass an idle hour but i could not help buying something and i was ever at the mercy of tradesmen who took advantage of my indolence and who thought my fortune inexhaustible i really had not any taste for expense but i let all who dealt with me especially my servants do as they pleased rather than be at the trouble of making them do as they ought they assured me that lord glenthorn must have such and such things and must do so and so and i quietly submitted to this imaginary necessity all this time i was the envy of my acquaintance but i was more deserving of their compassion without anxiety or exertion i possessed every thing they wanted but then i had no motivei had nothing to desire i had an immense fortune and i was the earl of glenthorn my title and wealth were sufficient distinctions how could i be anxious about my boots or the cape of my coat or any of those trifles which so happily interest and occupy the lives of fashionable young men who have not the misfortune to possess large estates most of my companions had some real or imaginary grievance some old uncle or father some cursed profession to complain of but i had none they had hopes and fears but i had none i was on the pinnacle of glory which they were endeavouring to reach and i had nothing to do but to sit still and enjoy the barrenness of the prospect in this recital i have communicated i hope to my readers some portion of that ennui which i endured otherwise they cannot form an adequate idea of my temptation to become a gambler i really had no vice nor any of those propensities which lead to vice but ennui produced most of the effects that are usually attributed to strong passions or a vicious disposition </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ii o ressource assure viens ranimer leur langueur desoeuvre leur me vide est du moins amuse par lavarice en plaisir deguise gaming relieved me from that insuperable listlessness by which i was oppressed i became interestedi became agitated in short i found a new kind of stimulus and i indulged in it most intemperately i grew immoderately fond of that which supplied me with sensations my days and nights were passed at the gamingtable i remember once spending three days and three nights in the hazardroom of a wellknown house in st jamessstreet the shutters were closed the curtains down and we had candles the whole time even in the adjoining rooms we had candles that when our doors were opened to bring in refreshments no obtrusive gleam of daylight might remind us how the hours had passed how human nature supported the fatigue i know not we scarcely allowed ourselves a moments pause to take the sustenance our bodies required at last one of the markers who had been in the room with us the whole time declared that he could hold out no longer and that sleep he must with difficulty he obtained an hours truce the moment he got out of the room he fell asleep absolutely at the very threshold of our door by the rules of the house he was entitled to a bonus on every transfer of property at the hazardtable and he had made in the course of these three days upwards of three hundred pounds sleep and avarice had struggled to the utmost but with his vulgar habits sleep prevailed we were wide awake i shall never forget the figure of one of my noble associates who sat holding his watch his eager eyes fixed upon the minutehand whilst he exclaimed continually this hour will never be over then he listened to discover whether his watch had stopped then cursed the lazy fellow for falling asleep protesting that for his part he never would again consent to such waste of time the very instant the hour was ended he ordered that dog to be awakened and to work we went at this sitting 35000l were lost and won i was very fortunate for i lost a mere trifleten thousand pounds but i could not expect to be always so luckynow we come to the old story of being ruined by play my english john othescales warned me that he could advance no more money </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> money my irish agent upon whom my drafts had indeed been unmerciful could not oblige me any longer and he threw up his agency after having made his fortune at my expense i railed but railing would not pay my debts of honour i inveighed against my grandfather for having tied me up so tight i could neither mortgage nor sell my irish estate would have been sold instantly had it not been settled upon a mr delamere the pleasure of abusing him whom i had never seen and of whom i knew nothing but that he was to be my heir relieved me wonderfully he died and left only a daughter a mere child my chance of possessing the estate in feesimple increased i sold this increased value to the jews and gamed on miss delamere some time afterwards had the smallpox upon the event of her illness i laid bets to an amazing amount she recovered no more money could be raised and my debts were to be paid in this dilemma i recollected that i once had a guardian and that i had never settled accounts with him crawley who continued to be my factotum and flatterer in ordinary and extraordinary informed me upon looking over these accounts that there was a mine of money due to me if i could but obtain it by law or equity to law i went and the anxiety of a lawsuit might have in some degree supplied the place of gambling but that all my business was managed for me by crawley and i charged him never to mention the subject to me till a verdict should be obtained a verdict was obtained against me it was proved in open court by my own witnesses that i was a fool but as no judge jury or chancellor could believe that i was so great a fool as my carelessness indicated my guardian stood acquitted in equity of being so great a rogue as he really was what was now to be done i saw my doom as a highwayman knows that he must come to the gallows at last and acts accordingly so a fashionably extravagant youth knows that sooner or later he must come to matrimony no one could have more horror of this catastrophe than i felt but it was in vain to oppose my destiny my opinion of women had been formed from the commonplace jests of my companions and from my own acquaintance with the worst part of the sex i had never felt the passion of love and of course believed it to be something that might have existed in former ages but that it was in our days quite obsolete at least among the knowing part of the world in my imagination young women were divided into two classes those who were to be purchased and those who were to purchase between these two classes though the division was to be marked externally by a certain degree of ceremony yet i was internally persuaded that there was no essential difference in my feelings towards them there was some distinction of the first class i was tired and of the second i was afraid afraid yesafraid of being taken in with these fears and these sentiments i was now to choose a wife i chose her by the numeration table units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands i was content in the language of the newspapers to lead to the hymeneal altar any fashionable fair one whose fortune came under the sixth place of figures no sooner were my dispositions known than the friends of a young heiress who wanted to purchase a coronet settled a match between us my bride had one hundred weddingdresses elegant as a select committee of dressmakers and milliners french and english could devise the least expensive of these robes as well as i remember cost fifty guineas the most admired came to about five hundred pounds and was thought by the best judges in these matters to be wonderfully cheap as it was of lace such as had never before been trailed in english dust even by the lady of a nabob these things were shown in london as a spectacle for some days by the dressmaker who declared that she had lost many a nights rest in contriving how to make such a variety of dresses sufficiently magnificent and distinguished the jewellers also requested and obtained permission to exhibit the different sets of jewels these were so numerous that lady glenthorn scarcely knew them all one day soon after her marriage somebody at court observing that her diamonds were prodigiously fine </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> fine asked where she bought them really said she i cannot tell i have so many sets i declare i dont know whether its my paris or my hamburgh or my london set poor young creature i believe her chief idea of happiness in marriage was the possession of the jewels and paraphernalia of a countessi am sure it was the only hope she could have that was likely to be realized in marrying me i thought it manly and fashionable to be indifferent if not contemptuous to my wife i considered her only as an incumbrance that i was obliged to take along with my fortune besides the disagreeable ideas generally connected with the word wife i had some peculiar reasons for my aversion to my lady glenthorn before her friends would suffer me to take possession of her fortune they required from me a solemn oath against gambling so i was compelled to abjure the hazardtable and the turf the only two objects in life that could keep me awake this extorted vow i set down entirely to my brides account and i therefore became even more averse to her than men usually are who marry for money yet this dislike subsided lady glenthorn was only childishi of an easy temper i thought her ridiculous but it was too much trouble to tell her so continually i let the occasions pass and even forgot her ladyship when she was not absolutely in my way she was too frivolous to be hated and the passion of hatred was not to be easily sustained in my mind the habit of ennui was stronger than all my passions put together </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iii or realize what we think fabulous i th bill of fare of eliogabalus after my marriage my old malady rose to an insupportable height the pleasures of the table were all that seemed left to me in life most of the young men of any ton either were or pretended to be connoisseurs in the science of good eating their talk was of sauces and of cooks what dishes each cook was famous for whether his forte lay in white sauces or brown in soups lentilles fricandeaus bechemele matelotes daubes c then the history and genealogy of the cooks came after the discussion of the merit of the works whom my lord cs cook lived with formerlywhat my lord d gave his cookwhere they met with these great geniuses c i cannot boast that our conversation at these select dinners from which the ladies were excluded was very entertaining but true good eaters detest wit at dinnertime and sentiment at all times i think i observed that amongst these cognoscenti there was scarcely one to whom the delicacy of taste did not daily prove a source of more pain than pleasure there was always a cruel something that spoiled the rest or if the dinner were excellent beyond the power of the most fastidious palate to condemn yet there was the hazard of being placed far from the favourite dish or the still greater danger of being deputed to carve at the head or foot of the table how i have seen a heavy nobleman of this set dexterously manoeuvre to avoid the dangerous honour of carving a haunch of venison but good heavens said i when a confidential whisper first pointed out this to my notice why does he not like to carvehe would have it in his power to help himself to his mind which nobody else can do so wellno if he carve he must give the nice bits to others every body here understands them as well as heeach knows what is upon his neighbours plate and what ought to be there and what must be in the dish i found that it was an affair of calculationa game at which nobody can cheat without being discovered and disgraced i emulated and soon equalled my experienced friends i became a perfect epicure and gloried in the character for it could be supported without any intellectual exertion and it was fashionable i cannot say that i could ever eat as much as some of my companions one of them i once heard exclaim after a monstrous dinner i wish my digestion were equal to my appetite i would not be thought to exaggerate therefore i shall not recount the wonders i have seen performed by these capacious heroes of the table after what i have beheld to say nothing of what i have achieved i can believe any thing that is related of the capacity of the human stomach i can credit even the account of the dinner which madame de bavire </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> bavire affirms she saw eaten by lewis the fourteenth viz quatre assiettes de diffrentes soupes un faisan tout entier un perdrix une grande assiette pleine de salade du mouton coup dans son jus avec de lail deux bons morceaux de jambon une assiette pleine de patisserie du fruit et des confitures nor can i doubt the accuracy of the historian who assures us that a roman emperor73 one of the most moderate of those imperial gluttons took for his breakfast 500 figs 100 peaches 10 melons 100 beccaficoes and 400 oysters epicurism was scarcely more prevalent during the decline of the roman empire than it is at this day amongst some of the wealthy and noble youths of britain not one of my select dinnerparty but would have been worthy of a place at the turbot consultation immortalized by the roman satirist a friend of mine a bishop one day went into his kitchen to look at a large turbot which the cook was dressing the cook had found it so large that he had cut off the fins what a shame cried the bishop and immediately calling for the cooks apron he spread it before his cassock and actually sewed the fins again to the turbot with his own episcopal hands if i might judge from my own experience i should attribute fashionable epicurism in a great measure to ennui many affect it because they have nothing else to do and sensual indulgences are all that exist for those who have not sufficient energy to enjoy intellectual pleasures i dare say that if heliogabalus could be brought in evidence in his own case and could be made to understand the meaning of the word ennui he would agree with me in opinion that it was the cause of half his vices his offered reward for the discovery of a new pleasure is stronger evidence than any confession he could make i thank god that i was not born an emperor or i might have become a monster though not in the least inclined to cruelty i might have acquired the taste for it merely for desire of the emotion which real tragedies excite fortunately i was only an earl and an epicure my indulgence in the excesses of the table injured my health violent bodily exercise was necessary to counteract the effects of intemperance it was my maxim that a man could never eat or drink too much if he would but take exercise enough i killed fourteen horses74 and survived but i grew tired of killing horses and i continued to eat immoderately i was seized with a nervous complaint attended with extreme melancholy frequently the thoughts of putting an end to my existence occurred and i had many times determined upon the means but very small and apparently inadequate and ridiculous motives prevented the execution of my design once i was kept alive by a piggery which i wanted to see finished another time i delayed destroying myself till a statue which i had just purchased at a vast expense should be put up in my egyptian salon by the awkwardness of the unpacker the statues thumb was broken this broken thumb saved my life it converted ennui into anger like montaigne and his sausage i had now something to complain of and i was happy but at last my anger subsided the thumb would serve me no longer as a subject of conversation and i relapsed into silence and black melancholy i was aweary of the sun my old thoughts recurred at this time i was just entering my twentyfifth year rejoicings were preparing for my birthday my lady glenthorn had prevailed upon me to spend the summer at sherwood park because it was new to her she filled the house with company and noise but this only increased my discontent my birthday arrivedi wished myself deadand i resolved to shoot myself at the close of the day i put a pistol into my pocket and stole out towards the evening unobserved by my jovial companions lady glenthorn and her set were dancing and i was tired of these sounds of gaiety i took the private way to the forest which was near the house but one of my grooms met me with a fine horse which an old tenant had just sent as a present on my birthday the horse was saddled and bridled the groom held the stirrup and up i got the fellow told me the private gate was locked and i turned as he pointed to go through the grand entrance at the outside of the gate sat upon the ground huddled in a great red cloak an </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> an old woman who started up and sprang forwards the moment she saw me stretching out her arms and her cloak with one and the same motion ogh is it you i see cried she in a strong irish tone at this sound and this sight my horse that was shy backed a little i called to the woman to stand out of my way heaven bless your sweet face im the nurse that suckled yees when ye was a baby in ireland manys the day ive been longing to see you continued she clasping her hands and standing her ground in the middle of the gateway regardless of my horse which i was pressing forward stand out of the way for gods sake my good woman or i shall certainly ride over you so so so said i patting my restless horse oh hes only shy god bless him hes as quite now as a lamb and kiss one or other of yees i must cried she throwing her arms about the horses neck the horse unaccustomed to this mode of salutation suddenly plunged and threw me my head fell against the pier of the gate the last sound i heard was the report of a pistol but i can give no account of what happened afterwards i was stunned by my fall and senseless when i opened my eyes i found myself stretched on one of the cushions of my landau and surrounded by a crowd of people who seemed to be all talking at once in the buzz of voices i could not distinguish any thing that was said till i heard captain crawleys voice above the rest saying send for a surgeon instantly but its all over its all over take the body the back way to the banquetinghouse i must run to lady glenthorn i perceived that they thought me dead i did not at this moment feel that i was hurt i was curious to know what they would all do so i closed my eyes again before any one perceived that i had opened them i lay motionless and they proceeded with me according to captain crawleys orders to the banquetinghouse when we arrived there my servants laid me on one of the turkish sofas and the crowd after having satisfied their curiosity dropped off one by one till i was left with a single footman and my steward i dont believe hes quite dead said the footman for his heart beats oh hes the same as dead for he does not stir hand or foot and his skull they say is fractured for certain but it will all be seen when the surgeon comes i am sure he will never do crawley will have every thing his own way now and i may as well decamp ay and among them said the footman i only hope i may get my wages what a fool that crawley made of my lord said the steward what a fool my lord made of himself said the footman to be ruled and let all his people be ruled by such an upstart with your leave mr turner ill just run to the house to say one word to james and be back immediately no no you must stay robert whilst i step home to lock my places before crawley begins to rummage the footman was now left alone with me scarcely had the steward been gone two minutes when i heard a low voice near me saying in a tone of great anxiety is he dead i half opened my eyes to see who it was that spoke the voice came from the door which was opposite to me and whilst the footman turned his back i raised my head and beheld the figure of the old woman who had been the cause of my accident she was upon her knees on the thresholdher arms crossed over her breast i never shall forget her face it was so expressive of despair is he dead she repeated i tell you yes replied the footman for the love of god let me come in if he is here cried she come in then and stay here whilst i run to the house 75 the footman ran off and my old nurse on seeing me burst into an agony of grief i did not understand one word she uttered as she spoke in her native language but her lamentations went to my heart for they came from hers she hung over me and i felt her tears dropping upon my forehead i could not refrain from whispering dont cryi am alive blessings on him exclaimed </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> exclaimed she starting back she then dropped down on her knees to thank god then calling me by every fondling name that nurses use to their children she begged my forgiveness and alternately cursed herself and prayed for me the strong affections of this poor woman touched me more than any thing i had ever yet felt in my life she seemed to be the only person upon earth who really cared for me and in spite of her vulgarity and my prejudice against the tone in which she spoke she excited in my mind emotions of tenderness and gratitude my good woman if i live i will do something for you tell me what i can do said i live live god bless you live thats all in the wide world i want of you my jewel and till you are well let me watch over you at nights as i used to do when you were a child and i had you in my arms all to myself dear three or four people now ran into the room to get before captain crawley whose voice was heard at this instant at a distance i had only time to make the poor woman understand that i wished to appear to be dead she took the hint with surprising quickness captain crawley came up the steps talking in the tone of a master to the steward and people who followed what is this old hag doing here where is robert where is thomas i ordered them to stay till i came mr turner why did not you stay what has not the coroner been here yet the coroner must see the body i tell you good god what a parcel of blockheads you all are how many times must i tell you the same thing nothing can be done till the coroner has seen him then well talk about the funeral mr turnerone thing at a time every thing shall be done properly mr turner lady glenthorn trusts every thing to melady glenthorn wishes that i should order every thing to be sureno doubtvery properi dont say against that but continued crawley turning towards the sofa upon which i lay and seeing ellinor kneeling beside me what keeps this old irish witch here still what business have you here pray and who are you or what are you plase your honour i was his nurse formerly and so had a natral longing to see him once again before i would die and did you come all the way from ireland on this wise errand troth i didevery inch of the way from his own sweet place why you are little better than a fool i think said crawley little better plase your honour but i was always so about them childer that i nursed childer well get along about your business now you see your nursing is not wanted here ill not stir out of this while he is here said my nurse catching hold of the leg of the sofa and clinging to it youll not stir you say cried captain crawley turn her out oh sure you would not have the crulty to turn his old nurse out before hes even cowld and wont you let me see him buried out with her out with her the old irish hag well have no howling here out with her john said crawley to my groom the groom hesitated i fancy for crawley repeated the order more imperiously out with her or go yourself may be its you that will go first yourself said she go first myself cried captain crawley furiously are you insolent to me and are not you crul to me and to my child i nursed that lies all as one as dead before you and was a good friend to you in his day no doubt crawley seized hold of her but she resisted with so much energy that she dragged along with her the sofa to which she clung and on which i lay stop cried i starting up there was sudden silence i looked round but could not utter another syllable now for the first time i was sensible that i had been really hurt by the fall my head grew giddy and my stomach sick i just saw crawleys fallen countenance and him and the steward looking at one another they were like hideous faces in a dream i sunk back ay lie down my darling dont be disturbing yourself for such as them said my nurse let them do what they will with me its little id care for them if you were but once in safe </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> safe hands i beckoned to the groom who had hesitated to turn out ellinor and bid him go to the housekeeper and have me put to bed she added i pointing to my old nurse is to sit up with me at night it was all i could say what they did with me afterwards i do not know but i was in my bed and a bandage was round my temples and my poor nurse was kneeling on one side of the bed with a string of beads in her hand and a surgeon and physician and crawley and my lady glenthorn were on the other side whispering together the curtain was drawn between me and them but the motion i made on wakening was instantly observed by crawley who immediately left the room lady glenthorn drew back my curtain and began to ask me how i did but when i fixed my eyes upon her she sunk upon the bed trembling violently and could not finish her sentence i begged her to go to rest and she retired the physician ordered that i should be kept quiet and seemed to think i was in danger i asked what was the matter with me and the surgeon with a very grave face informed me that i had an ugly contusion on my head i had heard of a concussion of the brain but i did not know distinctly what it was and my fears were increased by my ignorance the life which but a few hours before i had been on the point of voluntarily destroying because it was insupportably burdensome i was now the moment it was in danger most anxious to preserve and the interest which i perceived others had in getting rid of me increased my desire to recover my recovery was however for some time doubtful i was seized with a fever which left me in a state of alarming debility my old nurse whom i shall henceforward call by her name of ellinor attended me with the most affectionate solicitude during my illness76 she scarcely stirred from my bedside night or day and indeed when i came to the use of my senses she was the only person whom i really liked to have near me i knew that she was sincere and however unpolished her manners and however awkward her assistance the goodwill with which it was given made me prefer it to the most delicate and dexterous attentions which i believed to be interested the very want of a sense of propriety and the freedom with which she talked to me regardless of what was suited to her station or due to my rank instead of offending or disgusting me became agreeable besides the novelty of her dialect and of her turn of thought entertained me as much as a sick man could be entertained i remember once her telling me that if it plased god she would like to die on a christmasday of all days because the gates of heaven they say will be open all that day and who knows but a body might slip in unknownst when she sat up with me at nights she talked on eternally for she assured me there was nothing like talking as she had found to put one asy asleep i listened or not just as i liked any way she was contint she was inexhaustible in her anecdotes of my ancestors all tending to the honour and glory of the family she had also an excellent memory for all the insults or traditions of insults which the glenthorns had received for many ages back even to the times of the old kings of ireland long and long before they stooped to be lorded when their names which it was a pity and a murder and moreover a burning shame to change was oshaughnessy she was wellstored with histories of irish and scotish chiefs the story of oneill the irish blackbeard i am sure i ought to remember for ellinor told it to me at least six times then she had a large assortment of fairies and shadowless witches and banshees and besides she had legions of spirits and ghosts and haunted castles without end my own castle of glenthorn not excepted in the description of which she was extremely eloquent she absolutely excited in my mind some desire to see it for many a long year she said it had been her nightly prayer that she might live to see me in my own castle and often and often she was coming over to england to tell me so only her husband as long as he lived </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> lived would not let her set out on what he called a fools errand but it pleased god to take him to himself last fair day and then she resolved that nothing should hinder her to be with her own child against his birthday and now could she see me in my own castle glenthorn she would die contintand what a pity but i should be in it i was only a lord as she said in england but i could be all as one as a king in ireland ellinor impressed me with the idea of the sort of feudal power i should possess in my vast territory over tenants who were almost vassals and amongst a numerous train of dependents we resist the efforts made by those who we think exert authority or employ artifice to change our determinations whilst the perverse mind insensibly yields to those who appear not to have power or reason or address sufficient to obtain a victory i should not have heard any human being with patience try to persuade me to go to ireland except this ignorant poor nurse who spoke as i thought merely from the instinct of affection to me and to her native country i promised her that i would some time or other visit glenthorn castle but this was only a vague promise and it was but little likely that it should be accomplished as i regained my strength my mind turned or rather was turned to other thoughts </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iv one morningit was the day after my physicians had pronounced me out of all dangercrawley sent me a note by ellinor congratulating me upon my recovery and begging to speak to me for half an hour i refused to see him and said that i was not yet well enough to do business the same morning ellinor came with a message from turner my steward who with his humble duty requested to see me for five minutes to communicate to me something of importance i consented to see turner he entered with a face of suppressed joy and affected melancholy sad news i am bound in duty to be the bearer of my lord i was determined whatever came to pass however not to speak till your honour was out of danger which i thank heaven is now the case and i am happy to be able to congratulate your lordship upon looking as well as never mind my looks i will excuse your congratulations mr turner said i impatiently for the recollection of the banquetinghouse and the undertaker whom turner was so eager to introduce came full into my mind go on if you please five minutes is all i am at present able to give to any business and you sent me word you had something of importance to communicate true my lord but in case your lordship is not at present well enough or not so disposed i will wait your lordships leisure now or never mr turner speak but speak at once my lord i would have done so long ago but was loth to make mischief and besides could not believe what i heard whispered and would scarce believe what i verily saw though now as i cannot reasonably have a doubt i think it would be a sin and a burden upon my conscience not to speak only that i am unwilling to shock your lordship too much when but just recovering for that is not the time one would wish to tell or to hear disagreeable things mr turner either come to the point at once or leave me for i am not strong enough to bear this suspense i beg pardon my lord why then my lord the point is captain crawley what of him i never desire to hear his name again nor i i am sure my lord but there are some in the house might not be of our opinion who you sneaking fellow speak out cant you my ladymy lordnow it is out shell go off with him this night if not prevented my surprise and indignation were as great as if i had always been the fondest and the most attentive of husbands i was at length roused from that indifference and apathy into which i had sunk and though i had never loved my wife the moment i knew she was lost to me for ever was exquisitely painful astonishment the sense of disgrace the feeling of rage against that treacherous parasite by whom she had been seduced all combined to overwhelm me i could command my voice only enough to bid turner leave the room and tell no </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> no one that he had spoken to me on this subject not a soul he said should be told or could guess it left to my own reflections as soon as the first emotions of anger subsided i blamed myself for my conduct to lady glenthorn i considered that she had been married to me by her friends when she was too young and too childish to judge for herself that from the first day of our marriage i had never made the slightest effort to win her affections or to guide her conduct that on the contrary i had shown her marked indifference if not aversion with fashionable airs i had professed that provided she left me at liberty to spend the large fortune which she brought me and in consideration of which she enjoyed the title of countess of glenthorn i cared for nothing farther with the consequences of my neglect i now reproached myself in vain lady glenthorns immense fortune had paid my debts and had for two years supplied my extravagance or rather my indolence little remained and she was now in her twentythird year to be consigned to public disgrace and to a man whom i knew to be destitute of honour and feeling i pitied her and resolved to go instantly and make an effort to save her from destruction ellinor who watched all crawleys motions informed me that he was gone to a neighbouring town and had left word that he should not be home till after dinner lady glenthorn was in her dressingroom which was at a part of the house farthest from that which i now inhabited i had never left my room since my illness and had scarcely walked farther than from my bed to my armchair but i was so much roused by my feelings at this instant that to ellinors great astonishment i started from my chair and forbidding her to follow me walked without any assistance along the corridor which led to the backstairs and to lady glenthorns apartment i opened the private door of her dressingroom suddenlythe room was in great disorderher woman was upon her knees packing a trunk lady glenthorn was standing at a table with a parcel of open letters before her and a diamond necklace in her hand she started at the sight of me as if she had beheld a ghost the maid screamed and ran to a door at the farther end of the room to make her escape but that was bolted lady glenthorn was pale and motionless till i approached and then recollecting herself she reddened all over and thrust the letters into her tabledrawer her woman at the same instant snatched a casket of jewels swept up in her arms a heap of clothes and huddled them all together into the halfpacked trunk leave the room said i to her sternly she locked the trunk pocketed the key and obeyed i placed a chair for lady glenthorn and sat down myself we were almost equally unable to stand we were silent for some moments her eyes were fixed upon the ground and she leaned her head upon her hand in an attitude of despair i could scarcely articulate but making an effort to command my voice i at last said lady glenthorn i blame myself more than you for all that has happened for what said she making a feeble attempt at evasion yet at the same time casting a guilty look towards the drawer of letters you have nothing to conceal from me said i nothing said she in a feeble voice nothing said i for i know every thingshe startedand am willing to pardon every thing she looked up in my face astonished i am conscious continued i that you have not been well treated by me you have had much reason to complain of my neglect to this i attribute your error forget the pasti will set you the example promise me never to see the man more and what has happened shall never be known to the world she made me no answer but burst into a flood of tears she seemed incapable of decision or even of thought i felt suddenly inspired with energy write this moment continued i placing a pen and ink before her write to forbid him ever to return to this house or ever more to appear in your presence if he should appear in mine i know how to chastise him and to vindicate my own honour to preserve your reputation i refrain upon these conditions from making my contempt of him public i put a pen into lady glenthorns hand but she </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> she trembled so that she could not write she made several ineffectual attempts then tore the paper and again giving way to tears exclaimed i cannot writei cannot thinki do not know what to say write what you will and i will sign it i write to captain crawley write what i will lady glenthorn it must be your will to write not mine if it be not your will say so oh i do not say soi do not say that give me a moments time i do not know what i say i have been very foolishvery wicked you are very goodbut it is too late it will all be known crawley will betray me he will tell it to mrs mattocks so whichever way i turn i am undone oh what will become of me she wrung her hands and wept and was for an hour in this state in all the indecision and imbecility of a child at last she wrote a few scarcely legible lines to crawley forbidding him to see or think of her more i despatched the note and she was full of penitence and gratitude and tears the next morning when i wakened i in my turn received a note from her ladyship since i saw you captain crawley has convinced me that i am his wife in the eye of heaven and i therefore desire a divorce as much as your whole conduct since my marriage convinces me you must in your heart whatever may be your motives to pretend otherwise before you receive this i shall be out of your way and beyond your reach so do not think of pursuing one who is no longer yours a crawley after reading this note i thought not of pursuing or saving lady glenthorn i was as anxious for a divorce as she could be some months afterwards the affair was brought to a public trial when the cause came on so many circumstances were brought in mitigation of damages to prove my utter carelessness respecting my wifes conduct that a suspicion of collusion arose from this imputation i was clear in the opinion of all who really knew me and i repelled the charge publicly with a degree of indignation that surprised all who knew the usual apathy of my temper i must observe that during the whole time my divorcebill was pending and whilst i was in the greatest possible anxiety my health was perfectly good but no sooner was the affair settled and a decision made in my favour than i relapsed into my old nervous complaints </chapter>

<chapter>chapter v twas doing nothing was his curse is there a vice can plague us worse the wretch who digs the mine for bread or ploughs that others may be fed feels less fatigue than that decreed to him who cannot think or read illness was a sort of occupation to me and i was always sorry to get well when the interest of being in danger ceased i had no other to supply its place i fancied that i should enjoy my liberty after my divorce but even freedom grew tasteless i do not recollect any thing that wakened me from my torpor during two months after my divorce except a violent quarrel between all my english servants and my irish nurse whether she assumed too much upon the idea that she was a favourite or whether national prejudice was alone the cause of the hatred that prevailed against her i know not but they one and all declared that they could not and would not live with her she expressed the same dislike to consorting with them but would put up with worse ay with the devils themselves to oblige my honour and to lie under the same roof wid my honour the rest of the servants laughed at her blunders this she could bear with goodhumour but when they seriously affected to reproach her with having by her uncouth appearance at her first presenting herself at sherwood park endangered my life she retorted and who cared for him in the wide world but i amongst you all when he lay for dead i ask you that said she to this there was no reply and they hated her the more for their having been silenced by her shrewdness i protected her as long as i could but for the sake of peace i at last yielded to the combined forces of the stewards room and the servants hall and despatched ellinor to ireland with a renewal of the promise that i would visit glenthorn castle this year or the next to comfort her at parting </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> parting i would have made her a considerable present but she would take only a few guineas to bear her expenses back to her native place the sacrifice i made did not procure me a peace of any continuance in my own houseruined by indulgence and by my indolent reckless temper my servants were now my masters in a large illregulated establishment domestics become like spoiled children discontented capricious and the tyrants over those who have not the sense or steadiness to command i remember one delicate puppy parted with me because as he informed me the curtains of his bed did not close at the foot he had never been used to such a thing and had told the housekeeper so three times but could obtain no redress which necessitated him to beg my permission to retire from the service in his stead another coxcomb came to offer himself who with an incomparably easy air begged to know whether i wanted a man of figure or a man of parts for the benefit of those to whom this fashionable classification of domestics may not be familiar i should observe that the department of a man of figure is specially and solely to announce company on gala days the business of the man of parts is multifarious to write cards of invitation to speak to impertinent tradesmen to carry confidential messages et cetera now where there is an et cetera in an agreement there is always an opening for dispute the functions of the man of parts not being accurately defined i unluckily required from him some service which was not in his bond i believe it was to go for my pocket handkerchief he could not possibly do it because it was not his business and i the laziest of mortals after waiting a full quarter of an hour whilst they were settling whose business it was to obey me was forced to get up and go for what i wanted i comforted myself by the recollection of the poor king of spain and le brasier with a regal precedent i could not but be satisfied all great people said i to myself are obliged to submit to these inconveniences i submitted with so good a grace that my submission was scarcely felt to be a condescension my bachelors house soon exhibited in perfection high life below stairs it is said that a foreign nobleman permitted his servants to take their own way so completely that one night he and his guests being kept waiting an unconscionable time for supper he at last went down stairs to inquire into the cause of the delay he found the servant whose business it was to take up supper quietly at cards with a large party of his friends the man coolly remonstrated that it was impossible to leave his game unfinished the master candidly acknowledged the force of his plea but insisted upon the mans going up stairs to lay the cloth for supper whilst he took his cards sat down and finished the game for him the suavity of my temper never absolutely reached this degree of complaisance my home was disagreeable to me i had not the resolution to remove the causes of the discontents every day i swore i would part with all these rascals the next morning but still they stayed abroad i was not happier than at home i was disgusted with my former companions they had convinced me the night of my accident at sherwood park that they cared not whether i was alive or dead and ever since that time i had been more and more struck with their selfishness as well as folly it was inexpressibly fatiguing and irksome to me to keep up a show of good fellowship and joviality with these people though i had not sufficient energy to make the attempt to quit them when these dashers and loungers found that i was not always at their disposal they discovered that glenthorn had always something odd about him that glenthorn had always a melancholy turn that it ran in the family c satisfied with these phrases they let me take my own way and forgot my existence public amusements had lost their charm i had sufficient steadiness to resist the temptation to game but for want of stimulus i could hardly endure the tedium of my days at this period of my life ennui was very near turning into misanthropy i balanced between becoming a misanthrope and a democrat whilst i was in this critical state of ineptitude my attention was accidentally roused by the sight of a boxingmatch my feelings were so much excited and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> and the excitation was so delightful that i was now in danger of becoming an amateur of the pugilistic art it did not occur to me that it was beneath the dignity of a british nobleman to learn the vulgar terms of the boxing trade i soon began to talk very knowingly of firstrate bruisers game men and pleasing fighters making playbeating a man under the ropessparringrallyingsawingand chopping what farther proficiency i might have made in this language or how long my interest in these feats of prizefighters might have continued had i been left to myself i cannot determine but i was unexpectedly seized with a fit of national shame on hearing a foreigner of rank and reputation express astonishment at our taste for these savage spectacles it was in vain that i repeated the arguments of some of the parliamentary panegyrists of boxing and bullbaiting and asserted that these diversions render a people hardy and courageous my opponent replied that he did not perceive the necessary connexion between cruelty and courage that he did not comprehend how the standing by in safety to see two men bruise each other almost to death could evince or inspire heroic sentiments or warlike dispositions he observed that the romans were most eager for the fights of gladiators during the reigns of the most effeminate and cruel emperors and in the decline of all public spirit and virtue these arguments would have probably made but a feeble impression on an understanding like mine unaccustomed to general reasoning and on a temper habituated to pursue without thought of consequences my immediate individual gratification but it happened that my feelings were touched at this time by the dreadful sufferings of one of the pugilistic combatants he died a few hours after the battle he was an irishman most of the spectators being english and triumphing in the victory of their countryman the poor fellows fate was scarcely noticed i spoke to him a little while before he died and found that he came from my own county his name was michael noonan he made it his dying request that i would carry halfaguinea the only money he possessed to his aged father and a silk handkerchief he had worn round his neck to his sister pity for this unfortunate irishman recalled ireland to my thoughts many small reasons concurred to make me now desirous of going to that country i should get rid at once of a tormenting establishment and of servants without the odium of turning them away for most of them declined going into banishment as they called it besides this i should leave my companions with whom i was disgusted i was tired of england and wanted to see something new even if it were to be worse than what i had seen before these were not my ostensible reasons i professed to have more exalted motives for my journey it was my duty i said to visit my irish estate and to encourage my tenantry by residing some time among them duties often spring up to our view at a convenient opportunity then my promise to poor ellinor it was impossible for a man of honour to break a promise even to an old woman in short when people are determined upon any action they seldom fail to find arguments capable of convincing them that their resolution is reasonable mixed motives govern the conduct of half mankind so i set out upon my journey to ireland </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vi es tu contente la fleur de tes ans as tu des gots et des amusemens tu dois mener une assez douce vie lautre en deux mots rpondait je mennuie cest un grand mal dit la fe et je crois quun beau secret est de rester chez soi i was detained six days by contrary winds at holyhead sick of that miserable place in my illhumour i cursed ireland and twice resolved to return to london but the wind changed my carriage was on board the packet so i sailed and landly safely in dublin i was surprised by the excellence of the hotel at which i was lodged i had not conceived that such accommodation could have been found in dublin the house had as i was told belonged to a nobleman it was fitted up and appointed with a degree of elegance and even magnificence beyond what i had been used to in the most fashionable hotels in london ah sir said an irish gentleman who found me in admiration upon the staircase this is all very good very fine but it is too good and too fine to last come here again in two years and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> and i am afraid you will see all this going to rack and ruin this is too often the case with us in ireland we can project but we cant calculate we must have every thing upon too large a scale we mistake a grand beginning for a good beginning we begin like princes and we end like beggars i rested only a few days in a capital in which i took it for granted there could be nothing worth seeing by a person who was just come from london in driving through the streets i was however surprised to see buildings which my prejudices could scarcely believe to be irish i also saw some things which recalled to my mind the observations i had heard at my hotel i was struck with instances of grand beginnings and lamentable want of finish with mixture of the magnificent and the paltry of admirable and execrable taste though my understanding was wholly uncultivated these things struck my eye of all the faculties of my mind my taste had been most exercised because its exercise had given me least trouble impatient to see my own castle i left dublin i was again astonished by the beauty of the prospects and the excellence of the roads i had in my ignorance believed that i was never to see a tree in ireland and that the roads were almost impassable with the promptitude of credulity i now went from one extreme to the other i concluded that we should travel with the same celerity as upon the bath road and i expected that a journey for which four days had been allotted might be performed in two like all those who have nothing to do any where i was always in a prodigious hurry to get from place to place and i ever had a noble ambition to go over as much ground as possible in a given space of time i travelled in a light barouche and with my own horses my own man an englishman and my cook a frenchman followed in a hackney chaise i cared not how so that they kept up with me the rest was their affair at night my gentleman complained bitterly of the irish post carriages and besought me to let him follow at an easier rate the next day but to this i could by no means consent for how could i exist without my own man and my french cook in the morning just as i was ready to set off and had thrown myself back in my carriage my englishman and frenchman came to the door both in so great a rage that the one was inarticulate and the other unintelligible at length the object of their indignation spoke for itself from the inn yard came a hackney chaise in a most deplorable crazy state the body mounted up to a prodigious height on unbending springs nodding forwards one door swinging open three blinds up because they could not be let down the perch tied in two places the iron of the wheels half off half loose wooden pegs for linchpins and ropes for harness the horses were worthy of the harness wretched little dogtired creatures that looked as if they had been driven to the last gasp and as if they had never been rubbed down in their lives their bones starting through their skin one lame the other blind one with a raw back the other with a galled breast one with his neck poking down over his collar and the other with his head dragged forward by a bit of a broken bridle held at arms length by a man dressed like a mad beggar in half a hat and half a wig both awry in opposite directions a long tattered greatcoat tied round his waist by a hayrope the jagged rents in the skirts of his coat showing his bare legs marbled of many colours while something like stockings hung loose about his ankles the noises he made by way of threatening or encouraging his steeds i pretend not to describe in an indignant voice i called to the landlord i hope these are not the horsesi hope this is not the chaise intended for my servants the innkeeper and the pauper who was preparing to officiate as postilion both in the same instant exclaimed sorrow better chaise in the county sorrow said i what do you mean by sorrow that theres no better plase your honour can be seen we have two more to be sure but one has no top and the other no bottom any way theres no better can be seen than </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> than this same 77 and these horses cried i why this horse is so lame he can hardly stand oh plase your honour tho he cant stand hell go fast enough he has a great deal of the rogue in him plase your honour hes always that way at first setting out and that wretched animal with the galled breast hes all the better for it when once he warms its he that will go with the speed of light plase your honour sure is not he knockecroghery and didnt i give fifteen guineas for him barring the luck penny at the fair of knockecroghery and he rising four year old at the same time i could not avoid smiling at this speech but my gentleman maintaining his angry gravity declared in a sullen tone that he would be cursed if he went with such horses and the frenchman with abundance of gesticulation made a prodigious chattering which no mortal understood then ill tell you what youll do said paddy youll take four as becomes gentlemen of your quality and youll see how well powder along and straight he put the knuckle of his forefinger in his mouth and whistled shrill and strong and in a moment a whistle somewhere out in the fields answered him i protested against these proceedings but in vain before the first pair of horses were fastened to the chaise up came a little boy with the others fresh from the plough they were quick enough in putting these to yet how they managed it with their tackle i know not now were fixed handsomely said paddy but this chaise will break down the first mile is it this chaise plase your honour ill engage it will go the worlds end the universe wouldnt break it down now sure it was mended but last night then seizing his whip and reins in one hand he clawed up his stockings with the other so with one easy step he got into his place and seated himself coachmanlike upon a wellworn bar of wood that served as a coachbox throw me the loan of a trusty bartly for a cushion said he a frieze coat was thrown up over the horses headspaddy caught it where are you hosey cried he sure im only rowling a wisp of straw on my leg replied hosey throw me up added this paragon of postilions turning to one of the crowd of idle bystanders arrah push me up cant ye a man took hold of his knee and threw him upon the horse he was in his seat in a trice then clinging by the mane of his horse he scrambled for the bridle which was under the other horses feetreached it and well satisfied with himself looked round at paddy who looked back to the chaisedoor at my angry servants secure in the last event of things in vain the englishman in monotonous anger and the frenchman in every note of the gamut abused paddy necessity and wit were on paddys side he parried all that was said against his chaise his horses himself and his country with invincible comic dexterity till at last both his adversaries dumbfoundered clambered into the vehicle where they were instantly shut up in straw and darkness paddy in a triumphant tone called to my postilions bidding them get on and not be stopping the way any longer without uttering a syllable they drove on but they could not nor could i refrain from looking back to see how those fellows would manage we saw the forehorses make towards the right then to the left and every way but straight forwards whilst paddy bawled to hoseykeep the middle of the road cant ye i dont want ye to draw a pound atallatall at last by dint of whipping the four horses were compelled to set off in a lame gallop but they stopped short at a hill near the end of the town whilst a shouting troop of ragged boys followed and pushed them fairly to the top half an hour afterwards as we were putting on our dragchain to go down another steep hillto my utter astonishment paddy with his horses in full gallop came rattling and chehupping past us my people called to warn him that he had no drag but still he cried never fear and shaking the long reins and stamping with his foot on he went thundering down the hill my englishmen were aghast the turn yonder below at the bottom of the hill is as sharp and ugly as ever i see said my postilion after a moments stupified silence he will break their necks </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> necks as sure as my name is john quite the contrary when we had dragged and undragged and came up to paddy we found him safe on his legs mending some of his tackle very quietly if that had broken as you were going down the steep hill said i it would have been all over with you paddy thats true plase your honour but it never happened me going down hillnor never will by the blessing of god if ive any luck with this mixed confidence in a special providence and in his own good luck paddy went on much to my amusement it was his glory to keep before us and he rattled on till he came to a narrow part of the road where they were rebuilding a bridge here there was a dead stop paddy lashed his horses and called them all manner of names but the wheel horse knockecroghery was restive and at last began to kick most furiously it seemed inevitable that the first kick which should reach the splinterbar at which it was aimed must demolish it instantly my english gentleman and my frenchman both put their heads out of the only window which was pervious and called most manfully to be let out never fear said paddy to open the door for themselves was beyond their force or skill one of the hind wheels which had belonged to another carriage was too high to suffer the door to be opened and the blind at the other side prevented their attempts so they were close prisoners the men who had been at work on the broken bridge came forward and rested on their spades to see the battle as my carriage could not pass i was also compelled to be a spectator of this contest between man and horse never fear reiterated paddy ill engage ill be up wid him now for it knockecroghery oh the rogue he thinks he has me at a nonplush but ill show him the differ after this brag of war paddy whipped knockecroghery kicked and paddy seemingly unconscious of danger sat within reach of the kicking horse twitching up first one of his legs then the other and shifting as the animal aimed his hoofs escaping every time as it were by miracle with a mixture of temerity and presence of mind which made us alternately look upon him as a madman and a hero he gloried in the danger secure of success and of the sympathy of the spectators ah didnt i compass him cleverly then oh the villain to be browbating me im too cute for him yet see there now hes come to and ill be his bail hell go asy enough wid me ogh he has a fine spirit of his own but its i that can match him twould be a poor case if a man like me coudnt match a horse any way let alone a mare which this is or it never would be so vicious after this hardfought battle and suitable rejoicing for the victory paddy walked his subdued adversary on a few yards to allow us to pass him but to the dismay of my postilions a hayrope was at this instant thrown across the road before our horses by the roadmakers who to explain this proceeding cried out plase your honour the road is so dry wed expect a trifle to wet it what do these fellows mean said i its only a tester or a hog they want your honour to give em to drink your honours health said paddy a hog to drink my health ay that is a thirteen plase your honour all as one as an english shilling i threw them a shilling the hayrope was withdrawn and at last we went on we heard no more of paddy till evening he came in two hours after us and expected to be doubly paid for driving my honours gentlemen so well i must say that on this journey though i met with many delays and disasters though one of my horses was lamed in shoeing by a smith who came home drunk from a funeral and though the back pannel of my carriage was broken by the pole of a chaise and though one day i went without my dinner at a large desolate inn where nothing was to be had but whiskey and though one night i lay in a little smoky den in which the meanest of my servants in england would have thought it impossible to sleep and though i complained bitterly and swore it was impracticable for a gentleman to travel in ireland yet i </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> i never remember to have experienced on any journey less ennui78 i was out of patience twenty times a day but i certainly felt no ennui and i am convinced that the benefit some patients receive from a journey is in an inverse proportion to the ease and luxury of their mode of travelling when they are compelled to exert their faculties and to use their limbs they forget their nerves as i did upon this principle i should recommend to wealthy hypochondriacs a journey in ireland preferably to any country in the civilized world i can promise them that they will not only be moved to anger often enough to make their blood circulate briskly but they will even in the acme of their impatience be thrown into salutary convulsions of laughter by the comic concomitants of their disasters besides if they have hearts their best feelings cannot fail to be awakened by the warm generous hospitality they will receive in this country from the cabin to the castle late in the evening of the fourth day we came to an inn on the verge of the county where my estate was situate it was one of the wildest parts of ireland we could find no horses nor accommodations of any sort and we had several miles farther to go for our only comfort the dirty landlady who had married the hostler and wore gold drop earrings reminded us that sure if we could but wait an hour and take a fresh egg we should have a fine moon after many fruitless imprecations my french cook was obliged to mount one of my saddlehorses my groom was left to follow us the next day i let my gentleman sit on the barouche box and proceeded with my own tired horses the moon which my landlady had promised me rose and i had a full view of the face of the country as we approached my maritime territories the cottages were thinly scattered and the trees had a stunted appearance they all slanted one way from the prevalent winds that blew from the ocean our road presently stretched along the beach and i saw nothing to vary the prospect but rocks and their huge shadows upon the water the road being sandy the feet of the horses made no noise and nothing interrupted the silence of the night but the hissing sound of the carriagewheels passing through the sand what oclock is it now think you john said one of my postilions to the other past twelve for sartain said john and this bees a strange irish place continued he in a drawling voice with no possible way o getting at it as i see john after a pause resumed i say timothy to the best of my opinion this here road is leading on us into the sea john replied that he did suppose there might be such a thing as a boat farther on but where he could not say for sartain dismayed and helpless they at last stopped to consult whether they had come the right road to the house in the midst of their consultation there came up an irish carman whistling as he walked beside his horse and car honest friend is this the road to glenthorn castle to glenthorn sure enough your honour whereabouts is the castle forenent you if you go on to the turn forenent you as the postilions pondered upon this word the carman leaving his horse and car turned back to explain by action what he could not make intelligible by words see isnt here the castle cried he darting before us to the turn of the road where he stood pointing at what we could not possibly see as it was hid by a promontory of rock when we f reached the spot where he was stationed we came full upon the view of glenthorn castle it seemed to rise from the sea abrupt and insulated in all the gloomy grandeur of ancient times with turrets and battlements and a huge gateway the pointed arch of which receded in perspective between the projecting towers its my lord himself im fond to believe said our guide taking off his hat i had best step on and tell em at the castle no my good friend there is no occasion to trouble you farther you had better go back to your horse and car which you have left on the road oh they are used to that plase your honour theyll go on very quite and ill run like a redshank with the news to the castle he ran on before us with surprising velocity whilst our </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> our tired horses dragged us slowly through the sand as we approached the gateway of the castle opened and a number of men who appeared to be dwarfs when compared with the height of the building came out with torches in their hands by their bustle and the vehemence with which they bawled to one another one might have thought that the whole castle was in flames but they were only letting down a drawbridge as i was going over this bridge a casement window opened in the castle and a voice which i knew to be old ellinors exclaimed mind the big hole in the middle of the bridge god bless yees i passed over the broken bridge and through the massive gate under an arched way at the farthest end of which a lamp had just been lighted then i came into a large open area the court of the castle the hollow sound of the horses feet and of the carriage rumbling over the drawbridge was immediately succeeded by the strange and eager voices of the people who filled the court with a variety of noises contrasting in the most striking manner with the silence in which we had travelled over the sands the great effect that my arrival instantaneously produced upon the multitude of servants and dependants who issued from the castle gave me an idea of my own consequence beyond any thing which i had ever felt in england these people seemed born for my use the officious precipitation with which they ran to and fro the style in which they addressed me some crying long life to the earl of glenthorn some blessing me for coming to reign over them all together gave more the idea of vassals than of tenants and carried my imagination centuries back to feudal times the first person i saw on entering the hall of my castle was poor ellinor she pushed her way up to me tis himself cried she then turning about suddenly ive seen him in his own castleive seen him and if it pleases god this minute to take me to himself i would die with pleasure my good ellinor said i touched to the heart by her affection my good ellinor i hope you will live many a happy year and if i can contribute and himself to speak to me so kind before them all interrupted she oh this is too muchquite too much she burst into tears and hiding her face with her arm made her way out of the hall the flights of stairs which i had to ascend and the length of galleries through which i was conducted before i reached the apartment where supper was served gave me a vast idea of the extent of my castle but i was too much fatigued to enjoy fully the gratifications of pride to the simple pleasures of appetite i was more sensible i ate heartily of one of the most profusely hospitable suppers that ever was prepared for a noble baron even in the days when oxen were roasted whole then i grew so sleepy that i was impatient to be shown to my bed i was ushered through another suite of chambers and galleries and as i was traversing one of these a door of some strange dormitory opened and a group of female heads were thrust out in the midst of which i could distinguish old ellinors face but as i turned my head the door closed so quickly that i had no time to speak i only heard the words blessings on him thats he i was so sleepy that i rejoiced having escaped an occasion where i might have been called upon to speak yet i was really grateful to my poor nurse for her blessing the state tower in which after reiterated entreaties i was at last left alone to repose was hung with magnificent but ancient tapestry it was so like a room in a haunted castle that if i had not been too much fatigued to think of any thing i should certainly have thought of mrs radcliffe i am sorry to say that i have no mysteries or even portentous omens to record of this night for the moment that i lay down in my antiquated bed i fell into a profound sleep </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vii when i awoke i thought that i was on shipboard for the first sound i heard was that of the sea booming against the castle walls i arose looked out of the window of my bedchamber and saw that the whole prospect bore an air of savage wildness as i contemplated the scene my </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> my imagination was seized with the idea of remoteness from civilized society the melancholy feeling of solitary grandeur took possession of my soul from this feeling i was relieved by the affectionate countenance of my old nurse who at this instant put her head half in at the door i only just made bold to look in at the fire to see did it burn because i lighted it myself and would not be blowing of it for fear of wakening you come in ellinor come in said i come quite in i will since youve nobody with you that i need be afraid of said she looking round satisfied when she saw my own man was not in the room you need never be afraid of any body ellinor whilst i am alive said i for i will always protect you i do not forget your conduct when you thought i was dead in the banquetingroom oh dont be talking of that thanks be to god there was nothing in it i see you well now long life to you sure you must have been tired to death last night for this morning early you lay so quite sleeping like an angel and i could see a great likeness in yees to what you were when you were a child in my arms but sit down sit down my good ellinor said i and let us talk a little of your own affairs and are not these my own affairs said she rather angrily certainly but i mean that you must tell me how you are going on in the world and what i can do to make you comfortable and happy theres one thing would make me happy said she name it said i to be let light your fire myself every morning and open your shutters dear i could not help smiling at the simplicity of the request i was going to press her to ask something of more consequence but she heard a servant coming along the gallery and starting from her chair she ran and threw herself upon her knees before the fire blowing it with her mouth with great vehemence the servant came to let me know that mr mleod my agent was waiting for me in the breakfastroom and will i be let light your fire then every morning said ellinor eagerly turning as she knelt and welcome said i then you wont forget to speak about it for me said she else may be i wont be let up by them english god bless you and dont forget to speak for me i will remember to speak about it said i but i went down stairs and forgot it mr mleod whom i found reading the newspaper in the breakfastroom seemed less affected by my presence than any body i had seen since my arrival he was a hardfeatured strongbuilt perpendicular man with a remarkable quietness of deportment he spoke with deliberate distinctness in an accent slightly scotch and in speaking he made use of no gesticulation but held himself surprisingly still no part of him but his eyes moved and they had an expression of slow but determined good sense he was sparing of his words but the few that he used said much and went directly to the point he pressed for the immediate examination and settlement of his accounts he enumerated several things of importance which he had done for my service but he did this without pretending the slightest attachment to me he mentioned them only as proofs of his having done his duty to his employer for which he neither expected nor would accept of thanks he seemed to be cold and upright in his mind as in his body i was not influenced in his favour even by his striking appearance of plaindealing so strong was the general abhorrence of agents which crawleys treachery had left in my mind the excess of credulity when convinced of its error becomes the extreme of suspicion persons not accustomed to reason often argue absurdly because from particular instances they deduce general conclusions and extend the result of their limited experience of individuals indiscriminately to whole classes the labour of thinking was so great to me that having once come to a conclusion upon any subject i would rather persist in it right or wrong than be at the trouble of going over the process again to revise and rectify my judgment upon this occasion national prejudice heightened the prepossession which circumstances had raised mr mleod was not only an agent but a scotchman and i had a notion that all scotchmen were crafty therefore i </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> i concluded that his blunt manner was assumed and his plaindealing but a more refined species of policy after breakfast he laid before me a general statement of my affairs obliged me to name a day for the examination of his accounts and then without expressing either mortification or displeasure at the coldness of my behaviour or at my evident impatience of his presence he unmoved of spirit rang for his horse wished me a good morning and departed by this time my castleyard was filled with a crowd of greatcoated suitors who were all come to seecould they see my lordship or waiting just to say two words to my honour in various lounging attitudes leaning against the walls or pacing backwards and forwards before the window to catch my eye they with a patience passing the patience of courtiers waited hour after hour the livelong day for their turn or their chance of an audience i had promised myself the pleasure of viewing my castle this day and of taking a ride through my grounds but that was totally out of the question i was no longer a man with a will of my own or with time at my own disposal long may you live to reign over us was the signal that i was now to live like a prince only for the service of my subjects how these subjects of mine had contrived to go on for so many years in my absence i was at a loss to conceive for the moment i was present it seemed evident that they could not exist without me one had a wife and six childer and not a spot in the wide world to live in if my honour did not let him live under me in any bit of a skirt of the estate that would feed a cow another had a brother in jail who could not be got out without me another had three lives dropped in a lase for ever another wanted a renewal another a farm another a house and one expected my lard would make his son an exciseman and another that i would make him a policeman and another was racked if i did not settle the mearing between him and corny corkran and half a hundred had given in proposials to the agent for lands that would be out next may and half a hundred more came with legends of traditionary promises from the old lord my lordships father that was and for hours i was forced to listen to long stories out of the face in which there was such a perplexing and provoking mixture of truth and fiction involved in language so figurative and tones so new to my english ears that with my utmost patience and strained attention i could comprehend but a very small portion of what was said to me never were my ears so weary any day of my life as they were this day i could not have endured the fatigue if i had not been supported by the agreeable idea of my own power and consequence a power seemingly next to despotic this new stimulus sustained me for three days that i was kept a stateprisoner in my own castle by the crowds who came to do me homage and to claim my favour and protection in vain every morning was my horse led about saddled and bridled i never was permitted to mount on the fourth morning when i felt sure of having despatched all my tormentors i was in astonishment and despair on seeing my levee crowded with a fresh succession of petitioners i gave orders to my people to say that i was going out and absolutely could see nobody i supposed that they did not understand what my english servants said for they never stirred from their posts on receiving a second message they acknowledged that they understood the first but replied that they could wait there till my honour came back from my ride with difficulty i mounted my horse and escaped from the closing ranks of my persecutors at night i gave directions to have the gates kept shut and ordered the porter not to admit any body at his peril when i got up i was delighted to see the coast clear but the moment i went out lo at the outside of the gate the host of besiegers were posted and in my lawn and along the road and through the fields they pursued me and when i forbade them to speak to me when i was on horseback the next day i found parties in ambuscade who laid </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> laid wait for me in silence with their hats off bowing and bowing till i could not refrain from saying well my good friend what do you stand bowing there for then i was fairly prisoner and held by the bridle for an hour in short i found that i was now placed in a situation where i could hope neither for privacy nor leisure but i had the joys of power my rising passion for which would certainly have been extinguished in a short time by my habitual indolence if it had not been kept alive by jealousy of mr mleod one day when i refused to hear an importunate tenant and declared that i had been persecuted with petitioners ever since my arrival and that i was absolutely tired to death the man answered true for ye my lard and its a shame to be troubling you this way then may be its to mr mleod ill go sure the agent will do as well and no more about it mr mleod will do every thing the same way as usual mr mleod will do every thing said i hastily no by no means who will we speak to then said the man to myself said i with as haughty a tone as louis xiv could have assumed when he announced to his court his resolution to be his own minister after this intrepid declaration to act for myself i could not yield to my habitual laziness so much had my pride been hurt as well as my other feelings by captain crawleys conduct that i determined to show the world i was not to be duped a second time by an agent when on the day appointed mr mleod came to settle accounts with me i with an air of selfimportant capability as if i had been all my life used to look into my own affairs sat down to inspect the papers and incredible as it may appear i went through the whole at a sitting without a single yawn and for a man who never before had looked into an account i understood the nature of debtor and creditor wonderfully well but with my utmost desire to evince my arithmetical sagacity i could not detect the slightest error in the accounts and it was evident that mr mleod was not captain crawley yet rather than believe that he could be both an agent and an honest man i concluded that if he did not cheat me out of my money his aim was to cheat me out of power and fancying that he wished to be a man of influence and consequence in the county i transferred to him instantly the feelings that were passing in my own mind and took it for granted that he must be actuated by a love of power in every thing that he did apparently for my service about this time i remember being much disturbed in my mind by a letter which mr mleod received in my presence and of which he read to me only a part i never rested till i saw the whole the epistle proved well worth the trouble of deciphering it related merely to the paving of my chickenyard like the king of prussia79 who was said to be so jealous of power that he wanted to regulate all the mousetraps in his dominions i soon engrossed the management of a perplexing multiplicity of minute insignificant details alas i discovered to my cost that trouble is the inseparable attendant upon power and many times in the course of the first ten days of my reign i was ready to give up my dignity from excessive fatigue </chapter>

<chapter>chapter viii early one morning after having passed a feverish night tortured in my dreams by the voices and faces of the people who had surrounded me the preceding day i was awakened by the noise of somebody lighting my fire i thought it was ellinor and the idea of the disinterested affection of this poor woman came full into my mind contrasted in the strongest manner with the recollection of the selfish encroaching people by whom of late i had been worried how do you do my good ellinor said i i have not seen any thing of you this week past its not ellinor at all my lard said a new voice and why so why does not ellinor light my fire myself does not know my lard go for her directly shes gone home these three days my lard gone is she sick not as i know on my lard myself does not know what ailed her except she would </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> would be jealous of my lighting the fire but i cant say what ailed her for she went away without a word good or bad when she seen me lighting this fire which i did by the housekeepers orders i now recollected poor ellinors request and reproached myself for having neglected to fulfil my promise upon an affair which however trifling in itself appeared of consequence to her in the course of my mornings ride i determined to call upon her at her own house and make my apologies but first i satisfied my curiosity about a prodigious number of parks and towns which i had heard of upon my estate many a ragged man had come to me with the modest request that i would let him one of the parks near the town the horsepark the deerpark the cowpark were not quite sufficient to answer the ideas i had attached to the word park but i was quite astonished and mortified when i beheld the bits and corners of land near the town of glenthorn on which these highsounding titles had been bestowedjust what would feed a cow is sufficient in ireland to constitute a park when i heard the names of above a hundred towns on the glenthorn estate i had an exalted idea of my own territories and i was impatient to make a progress through my dominions but upon visiting a few of these places my curiosity was satisfied two or three cabins gathered together were sufficient to constitute a town and the land adjoining thereto is called a townland the denominations of these townlands having continued from generation to generation according to ancient surveys of ireland it is sufficient to show the boundaries of a townland to prove that there must be a town and a tradition of a town continues to be satisfactory even when only a single cabin remains i turned my horses head away in disgust from one of these traditionary towns and desired a boy to show me the way to ellinor odonoghoes house so i will plase your honour my lard sure ive a right to know for shes my own granny the boy or as he was called the gossoon ran across some fields where there was abundance of fern and of rabbits the rabbits sitting quietly at the entrance of their holes seemed to consider themselves as proprietors of the soil and me and my horse as intruders the boy apologized for the number of rabbitholes on this part of the estate it would not be so my lard if i had a gun allowed me by the gamekeeper which he would give me if he knew it would be plasing to your honour the ingenuity with which even the young boys can introduce their requests in a favourable moment sometimes provoked me and sometimes excited my admiration this boy made his just at the time he was rolling out of my way a car that stopped a gap in the hedge and he was so hot and out of breath with running in my service that i could not refuse him a token to the gamekeeper that he might get a gun as soon as i understood what it meant we came to ellinors house a wretchedlooking low and mudwalled cabin at one end it was propped by a buttress of loose stones upon which stood a goat reared on his hind legs to browse on the grass that grew on the housetop a dunghill was before the only window at the other end of the house and close to the door was a puddle of the dirtiest of dirty water in which ducks were dabbling at my approach there came out of the cabin a pig a calf a lamb a kid and two geese all with their legs tied followed by turkeys cocks hens chickens a dog a cat a kitten a beggarman a beggarwoman with a pipe in her mouth children innumerable and a stout girl with a pitchfork in her hand all together more than i looking down upon the roof as i sat on horseback and measuring the superficies with my eye could have possibly supposed the mansion capable of containing i asked if ellinor odonoghoe was at home but the dog barked the geese cackled the turkeys gobbled and the beggars begged with one accord so loudly that there was no chance of my being heard when the girl had at last succeeded in appeasing them all with her pitchfork she answered that ellinor odonoghoe was at home but that she was out with the potatoes and she ran to fetch her after calling to the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> the lays who was within in the room smoking to come out to his honour as soon as they had crouched under the door and were able to stand upright they welcomed me with a very good grace and were proud to see me in the kingdom i asked if they were all ellinors sons all entirely was the first answer not one but one was the second answer the third made the other two intelligible plase your honour we are all her sonsinlaw except myself who am her lawful son then you are my fosterbrother no plase your honour its not me but my brother and hes not in it not in it no plase your honour becaase hes in the forge up abow abow said i what does he mean sure hes the blacksmith my lard and what are you im ody plase your honour the short for owen and what is your trade trade plase your honour i was bred to none more than another but expects only that my mothers not willing to part with me to go into the militia next month and im sure shed let me if your honours lordship would spake a word to the colonel to see to get me made a serjeant immadiately as ody made his request all his companions came forward in sign of sympathy and closed round my horses head to make me sinsible of their expectations but at this instant ellinor came up her old face colouring all over with joy when she saw me so ellinor said i you were affronted i hear and left the castle in anger in anger and if i did more shame for mebut anger does not last long with me any way and against you my lord dear how could it oh think how good he is coming to see me in such a poor place i will make it a better place for you ellinor said i far from being eager to obtain promises she still replied that all was good enough for her i desired that she would come and live with me at the castle till a better house than her present habitation could be built for her but she seemed to prefer this hovel i assured her that she should be permitted to light my fire oh its better for me not said she better keep out of the way i could not be asy if i got any one illwill i assured her that she should be at liberty to do just as she liked and whilst i rode home i was planning a pretty cottage for her near the porters lodge i was pleased with myself for my gratitude to this poor woman before i slept i actually wrote a letter which obtained for ody the honour of being made a serjeant in the militia and ellinor dazzled by this military glory was satisfied that he should leave home though he was her favourite well let him leave me then said she i wont stand in his light i never thought of my living to see ody a serjeant now ody have done being wild honeydear and be a credit to your family and to his honours commendationgod bless him for ever for it from the very first i knew it was he that had the kind heart i am not sure that it was a very good action to get a man made a serjeant of whom i knew nothing but that he was son to my nurse selfcomplacency however cherished my first indistinct feelings of benevolence though not much accustomed to reflect upon my own sensations i think i remember at this period suspecting that the feeling of benevolence is a greater pleasure than the possession of barouches and horses and castles and parksgreater even than the possession of power of this last truth however i had not as yet a perfectly clear conception even in my benevolence i was as impatient and unreasonable as a child money i thought had the power of aladdins lamp to procure with magical celerity the gratification of my wishes i expected that a cottage for ellinor should rise out of the earth at my command but the slaves of aladdins lamp were not irishmen the delays and difficulties and blunders in the execution of my orders provoked me beyond measure and it would have been difficult for a cool spectator to decide whether i or my workmen were most in fault they for their dilatory habits or i for my impatient temper well plase your honour when the pratees are set and the turf cut well fallto at ellinors house </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> house confound the potatoes and the turf you must fallto as you call it directly is it without the lime and plase your honour sure that same is not drawn yet nor the stones quarried since it is of stone it will benor the foundations itself dug and the horses were all putting out dung then after the bog and the potatoes came funerals and holidays innumerable the masons were idle one week waiting for the mortar and the mortar another week waiting for the stones and then they were at a stand for the carpenter when they came to the doorcase and the carpenter was looking for the sawyer and the sawyer was gone to have the saw mended then there was a stop again at the windowsills for the stonecutter and he was at the quartersessions processing his brother for tin and tinpence haymoney and when in spite of all delays and obstacles the walls reached their destined height the roof was a new plague the carpenter the slater and the nailer were all at variance and i cannot tell which was the most provoking rogue of the three at last however the house was roofed and slated then i would not wait till the walls were dry before i plastered and papered and furnished it i fitted it up in the most elegant style of english cottages for i was determined that ellinors habitation should be such as had never been seen in this part of the world the day when it was finished and when i gave possession of it to ellinor paid me for all my trouble i tasted a species of pleasure that was new to me and which was the sweeter from having been earned with some difficulty and now when i saw a vast number of my tenants assembled at a rural feast which i gave on ellinors installation my benevolence enlarged even beyond the possibility of its gratification and i wished to make all my dependants happy provided i could accomplish it without much trouble the method of doing good which seemed to require the least exertion and which i therefore most willingly practised was giving away money i did not wait to inquire much less to examine into the merits of the claimants but without selecting proper objects i relieved myself from the uneasy feeling of pity by indiscriminate donations to objects apparently the most miserable i was quite angry with mr mleod my agent and considered him as a selfish hardhearted miser because he did not seem to sympathize with me or to applaud my generosity i was so much irritated by his cold silence that i could not forbear pressing him to say something i doubt then said he since you desire me to speak my mind my lord i doubt whether the best way of encouraging the industrious is to give premiums to the idle but idle or not these poor wretches are so miserable that i cannot refuse to give them something and surely when one can do it so easily it is right to relieve misery is it not undoubtedly my lord but the difficulty is to relieve present misery without creating more in future pity for one class of beings sometimes makes us cruel to others i am told that there are some indian brahmins so very compassionate that they hire beggars to let fleas feed upon them i doubt whether it might not be better to let the fleas starve i did not in the least understand what mr mleod meant but i was soon made to comprehend it by crowds of eloquent beggars who soon surrounded me many who had been resolutely struggling with their difficulties slackened their exertions and left their labour for the easier trade of imposing upon my credulity the money i had bestowed was wasted at the dramshop or it became the subject of familyquarrels and those whom i had relieved returned to my honour with fresh and insatiable expectations all this time my industrious tenants grumbled because no encouragement was given to them and looking upon me as a weak goodnatured fool they combined in a resolution to ask me for long leases or reduction of rent the rhetoric of my tenants succeeded in some instances and again i was mortified by mr mleods silence i was too proud to ask his opinion i ordered and was obeyed a few leases for long terms were signed and sealed and when i had thus my own way completely i could not refrain from recurring to mr mleods opinion i doubt my lord said he whether this measure may be as advantageous as you hope </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> hope these fellows these middlemen will underset the land and live in idleness whilst they rack a parcel of wretched undertenants but they said they would keep the land in their own hands and improve it and that the reason why they could not afford to improve before was that they had not long leases it may be doubted whether long leases alone will make improving tenants for in the next county to us there are many farms of the dowager lady ormsbys land let at ten shillings an acre and her tenantry are beggars and the land now at the end of the leases is worn out and worse than at their commencement i was weary listening to this cold reasoning and resolved to apply no more for explanations to mr mleod yet in my indolence i wanted the support of his approbation at the very time i was jealous of his interference at one time i had a mind to raise the wages of labour but mr mleod said it might be doubted whether the people would not work less when they could with less work have money enough to support them i was puzzled and then i had a mind to lower the wages of labour to force them to work or starve still provoking mr mleod said it might be doubted whether it would not be better to leave them alone i gave marriageportions to the daughters of my tenants and rewards to those who had children for i had always heard that legislators should encourage population still mr mleod hesitated to approve he observed that my estate was so populous that the complaint in each family was that they had not land for the sons it might be doubted whether if a farm could support but ten people it were wise to encourage the birth of twenty it might be doubted whether it were not better for ten to live and be well fed than for twenty to be born and to be halfstarved to encourage manufactures in my town of glenthorn i proposed putting a clause in my leases compelling my tenants to buy stuffs and linens manufactured at glenthorn and no where else stubborn mleod as usual began with i doubt whether that will not encourage the manufacturers at glenthorn to make bad stuffs and bad linen since they are sure of a sale and without danger of competition at all events i thought my tenants would grow rich and independent if they made every thing at home that they wanted yet mr mleod perplexed me by his doubt whether it would not be better for a man to buy shoes if he could buy them cheaper than he could make them he added something about the division of labour and smiths wealth of nations to which i could only answersmiths a scotchman i cannot express how much i dreaded mr mleods i doubtandit may be doubted from the pain of doubt and the labour of thought i was soon most agreeably reprieved by the company of a mr hardcastle whose visits i constantly encouraged by a most gracious reception mr hardcastle was the agent of the dowager lady ormsby who had a large estate in my neighbourhood he was the very reverse of my mr mleod in his deportment and conversation talkative selfsufficient peremptory he seemed not to know what it was to doubt he considered doubt as a proof of ignorance imbecility or cowardice can any man doubt was his usual beginning on every subject of human knowledge taste morals politics economy legislation on all affairs civil military or ecclesiastical he decided at once in the most confident tone yet he never read not he he had nothing to do with books he consulted only his own eyes and ears and appealed only to common sense as to theory he had no opinion of theory for his part he only pretended to understand practice and experienceand his practice was confined steadily to his own practice and his experience uniformly to what he had tried at newtownhardcastle at first i thought him a mighty clever man and i really rejoiced to see my doubter silenced after dinner when he had finished speaking in this decisive manner i used frequently to back him with avery truevery fairvery clearthough i understood what he said as little as he did himself but it was an ease to my mind to have a disputed point settledand i filled my glass with an air of triumph whilst mleod never contradicted my assertions nor controverted mr hardcastles arguments there was still an air of content and quiet selfsatisfaction in mleods very silence which surprised </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> surprised and vexed me one day when hardcastle was laying down the law upon several subjects in his usual dictatorial manner telling us how he managed his people and what order he kept them in i was determined that mleod should not enjoy the security of his silence and i urged him to give us his general opinion as to the means of improving the poor people in ireland i doubt said mleod whether any thing effectual can be done till they have a better education educationpshawthere it is nowthese bookmen cried hardcastle why my dear sir can any man alive who knows this country doubt that the common people have already too much education as it is calleda vast deal too much too many of them know how to read and write and cipher which i presume is all you mean by education not entirely said mleod a good education comprehends something more the more the worse interrupted hardcastle the more they know the worse they are sir depend on that i know the people of this country sir i have a good right to know them sir being born amongst them and bred amongst them so i think i may speak with some confidence on these matters and i give it as my decided humble opinion founded on irrefragable experience which is what i always build upon that the way to ruin the poor of ireland would be to educate them sir look at the poor scholars as they call themselves and what are they a parcel of young vagabonds in rags with a book under their arm instead of a spade or a shovel sir and what comes of this that they grow up the worstdisposed and the most troublesome seditiousrascals in the community i allow none of them about newtownhardcastlenonebanished them all useless vagrantshornets vipers sir and show me a quieter bettermanaged set of people than i have made of mine i go upon experience sir and thats the only thing to go upon and ill go no farther than newtownhardcastle if that wont bring conviction home to you nothing will i never was at newtownhardcastle said mleod drily well sir i hope it will not be the case long but in the mean time my good sir do give me leave to put it to your own common sense what can reading or writing do for a poor man unless he is to be a bailiff or an exciseman and you know all men cant expect to be bailiffs or excisemen can all the booklearning in the world sir dig a poor mans potatoes for him or plough his land or cut his turf then sir in this country wheres the advantage of education i humbly ask no sir no trust mekeep the irish common people ignorant and you keep em quiet and thats the only way with them for they are too quiet and smart as it is naturally teach them to read and write and its just adding fuel to firefire to gunpowder sir teach them any thing and directly you set them up now its our business to keep them down unless sir youd wish to have your throat cut education sir lord bless your soul sir they have a great deal too much they know too much already which makes them so refractory to the laws and so idle i will go no farther than newtownhardcastle to prove all this so my good sir concluded he triumphantly education i grant you is necessary for the rich but tell me if you can whats the use of education to the poor much the same i apprehend as to the rich answered mleod the use of education as i understand it is to teach men to see clearly and to follow steadily their real interests all morality you know is comprised in this definition and very true sir but all this can never apply to the poor in ireland why sir are they not men men to be sure but not like men in scotland the irish know nothing of their interests and as to morality thats out of the question they know nothing about it my dear sir that is the very thing of which i complain said mleod they know nothing because they have been taught nothing they cannot be taught sir did you ever try i did sir no later than last week a fellow that i caught stealing my turf instead of sending him to jail i said to him with a great deal of lenity my honest fellow did you never hear of the eighth commandment thou shalt not steal he confessed he had </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> had but did not know it was the eighth i showed it to him and counted it to him myself and set him for a punishment to get his whole catechism well sir the next week i found him stealing my turf again and when i caught him by the wrist in the fact he said it was because the priest would not let him learn the catechism i gave him because it was a protestant one now you see sir theres a bar for ever to all education mr mleod smiled said something about time and patience and observed that one experiment was not conclusive against a whole nation any thing like a general argument mr hardcastle could not comprehend he knew every blade of grass within the reach of his tether but could not reach an inch beyond any thing like an appeal to benevolent feelings was lost upon him for he was so frank in his selfishness that he did not even pretend to be generous by sundry selfcomplacent motions he showed whilst his adversary spoke that he disdained to listen almost as much as to read but as soon as mleod paused he said what you observe sir may possibly be very true but i have made up my mind then he went over and over again his assertions in a louder and a louder voice ending with a tone of interrogation that seemed to set all answer at defiance what have you to answer to me now sircan any man alive doubt this sir mleod was perfectly silent the company broke up and as we were going out of the room i maliciously asked mleod why he who could say so much in his own defence had suffered himself to be so completely silenced he answered me in his low deliberate voice in the words of moirquestce que la raison avec un filet de voix contre une gueule comme cellel at some other time added mr mleod my sentiments shall be at your lordships disposal indolent persons love positive people when they are of their own opinion because they are saved the trouble of developing their thoughts or supporting their assertions but the moment the positive differs in sentiment from the indolent man there is an end of the friendship the indolent man then hates his pertinacious adversary as much as he loved his sturdy friend so it happened between mr hardcastle and me this gentleman was a prodigious favourite with me so long as his opinions were not in opposition to my own but an accident happened which brought his love of power and mine into direct competition and then i found his peremptory mode of reasoning and his ignorance absurd and insufferable before i can do justice to my part of this quarrel i must explain the cause of the interest which i took in behalf of the persons aggrieved during the time that my first hot fit of benevolence was on me i was riding home one evening after dining with mr hardcastle and i was struck with the sight of a cabin more wretched than any i had ever before beheld the feeble light of a single rushcandle through the window revealed its internal misery does any body live in that hovel said i ay sure does there the noonans plase your honour replied a man on the road noonans i recollected the name to be that of the pugilist who had died in consequence of the combat at which i had been present in london who had with his dying breath besought me to convey his only halfguinea and his silk handkerchief to his poor father and sister i alighted from my horse asking the man at the same time if the son of this noonan had not died in england he had sir a son in england mick noonan who used to send him odd guineas i mind and was a good lad to his father though wild and theres been no account of him atallatall this long while but the old man has another boy a sober lad whos abroad with the army in the east indies and its he that is the hope of the family and theres the fatherand old as he is and poor and a cripple id engage there is not a happier man in the three counties at this very time speaking for it is just now i seen young jemmy riley the daughters bachelor go by with a letter what news says i great news says he a letter from tom noonan to his father and im going in to read it for him by the time my </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> my voluble informant had come to this period i had reached the cabin door who could have expected to see smiles and hear exclamations of joy under such a roof i saw the father with his hands clasped in ecstasy and looking up to heaven with the strong expression of delight in his aged countenance i saw every line of his face for the light of the candle was full upon it the daughter a beautiful girl kneeling beside him held the light for the young man who was reading her brothers letter i was sorry to interrupt them your honours kindly welcome said the old man making an attempt to rise pray dont let me disturb you it was only a letter from a boy of mine thats over the seas we was reading said the old man a better boy to an ould father thats good for nothing now in this world never was plase your honour see what he has sent me a draft here for ten guineas out of the little pay he has god for ever bless himas he surely will after a few minutes conversation the old mans heart was so much opened towards me that he talked as freely as if he had known me for years i led to the subject of his other son michael who was mentioned in the letter as a wild chap ah your honour thats what lies heaviest on my heart and will to my dying day that mick before he died which they say he did surely a twelvemonth ago over there in england never so much as sent me one line good or bad or his sister a token to remember him by even had he but sent us the least bit of a word or the least token in life i had been content said the sister wiping her eyes we dont so much as know how he died i took this moment to relate the circumstances of michael noonans death and when i told them of his dying request about the halfguinea and the silk handkerchief they were all so much touched that they utterly forgot the tenguinea draft which i saw on the ground in the dirt under the old mans feet whilst he contemplated the halfguinea which his poor michael had sent him repeating poor fellow poor fellow twas all he had in the world god bless himpoor michael he was a wild chap but none better to his parents than he while the life was in him poor michael in no country have i found such strong instances of filial affection as in ireland let the sons go where they may let what will befall them they never forget their parents at home they write to them constantly the most affectionate letters and send them a share of whatever they earn when i asked the daughter of this noonan why she had not married the old man answered thats her own faultif it be a fault to abide by an old father she wastes her youth here in the way your honour sees tending him who has none other to mind him oh let alone that said the girl with a cheerful smile we be too poor to think of marrying yet by a great deal so father dear youre no hinderance any way for dont i know and doesnt jemmy there know that its a sin and a shame as my mother used to say for them that have nothing to marry and set up housekeeping like the rogue that ruined my father thats true said the young man with a heavy sigh but times will mend or well strive and mend them with the blessing of god i left this miserable but in admiration of the generosity of its inhabitants i desired the girl to come to glenthorn castle the next day that i might give her the silk handkerchief which her poor brother had sent her the more i inquired into the circumstances of this family the more cause i found for pity and approbation the old man had been a good farmer in his day as the traditions of the aged and the memories of the young were ready to witness but he was unfortunately joined in copartnership with a drunken rogue who ran away and left an arrear of rent which ruined noonan mr hardcastle the agent called upon him to pay it and sold all that the old man possessed and this being insufficient to discharge the debt he was forced to give up his farm and retire with his daughter to this hovel and soon afterwards he lost the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> the use of his side by a paralytic stroke i was so much pleased with the goodness of these poor people that in despite of my indolent disposition i bestirred myself the very next day to find a better habitation for them on my own estate i settled them infinitely to their satisfaction in a small farm and the girl married her lover who undertook to manage the farm for the old man to my utter surprise i found that mr hardcastle was affronted by the part i took in this affair he complained that i had behaved in a very ungentlemanlike manner and had spirited the tenants away from lady ormsbys estate against the regulation which he had laid down for all the tenants not to emigrate from the estate jemmy riley it seems was one of the cotters on the ormsby estate a circumstance with which i was unacquainted indeed i scarcely at that time understood what was meant by a cotter mr hardcastles complaint in matter and manner was unintelligible to me but i was quite content to leave off visiting him as he left off visiting mebut here the matter did not stop this overwise and overbusy gentleman took upon him amongst other offices the regulation of the markets in the town of ormsby and as he apprehended for reasons best and only known to himself a year of scarcity he thought fit to keep down the price of oats and potatoes he would allow none to be sold in the market of ormsby but at the price which he stipulated the poor people grumbled and to remedy the injustice made private bargains with each other he had information of this and seized the corn that was selling above the price he had fixed young riley noonans soninlaw came to me to complain that his little oats were seized and detained i remonstrated hardcastle resented the appeal to me and bid him wait and be damned the young man who was rather of a hasty temper and who did not much like either to wait or be damned seized his own oats and was marching off when they were recaptured by hardcastles bailiff whom young riley knocked down and who as soon as he got up again went straight and swore examinations against riley then i was offended as i had a right to be by the custom of the country with the magistrate who took an examination against my tenant without writing first to me then there was a race between the examinations of my justice of peace and his justice of peace my indolence was conquered by my love of power i supported the contest the affair came before our grand jury i conquered and mr hardcastle was ever after of course my enemy to english ears the possessive pronouns my and his may sound extraordinary prefixed to a justice of peace but in many parts of ireland this language is perfectly correct a great man talks of making a justice of the peace with perfect confidence a very great man talks with as much certainty of making a sheriff and a sheriff makes the jury and the jury makes the law we must not forget however that in england during the reign of elizabeth a member of parliament defined a justice of peace to be an animal who for half a dozen chickens will dispense with half a dozen penal statutes time is necessary to enforce the sanctions of legislation and civilizationbut i am anticipating reflections which i made at a much later period of my life to return to my history my benevolence was soon checked by slight disappointments ellinors cottage which i had taken so much pains to build became a source of mortification to me one day i found my old nurse sitting at her wheel in the midst of the wreck and litter of all sorts of household furniture singing her favourite song of there was a lady loved a swine honey says she ill give ye a silver trough hunk says he ellinor seemed alas to have as little taste for the luxuries with which i had provided her as the pig had for the silver trough what i called conveniences were to her incumbrances she had not been used to them she was put out of her way and it was a daily torment to one of her habits to keep her house clean and neat there may be as some philosophers assure us that there is an innate love of order in the human mind but of this instinctive principle my poor ellinor was totally destitute her ornamented farmhouse became in a </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> a wonderfully short time a scene of dirt rubbish and confusion there was a partition between two rooms which had been built with turf or peat instead of bricks by the wise economy i had employed of course this was pulled down to get at the turf the stairs also were pulled down and burned though there was no scarcity of firing as the walls were plastered and papered before they were quite dry the paper grew mouldy and the plaster fell off in the hurry of finishing some of the woodwork had but one coat of paint in ireland they have not faith in the excellent dutch proverb paint costs nothing i could not get my workmen to give a second coat of paint to any of the sashes and the wood decayed divers panes of glass in the windows were broken and their places filled up with shoes an old hat or a bundle of rags some of the slates were blown off one windy night the slater lived at ten miles distance and before the slates were replaced the rain came in and ellinor was forced to make a bedchamber of the parlour and then of the kitchen retreating from corner to corner as the rain pursued till at last when it would come every way upon her bed she petitioned me to let her take the slates off and thatch the house for a slatedhouse she said was never so warm as a tatched cabin and as there was no smoke she was kilt with the cowld in my life i never felt so angry i was ten times more angry than when crawley ran away with my wife in a paroxysm of passion i reproached ellinor with being a savage an irishwoman and an ungrateful fool savage i am for any thing i know and fool i am thats certain but ungrateful i am not said she bursting into tears she went home and took to her bed and the next thing i heard from her son was that she was lying in the rheumatism which had kept her awake many a long night before she would come to complain to my honour of the house in dread that i should blame myself for sending of her into it afore it was dry the rheumatism reconciled me immediately to ellinor i let her take her own way and thatch the house and have as much smoke as she pleased and she recovered but i did not entirely recover my desire to do good to my poor tenants after forming in the first enthusiasm of my benevolence princely schemes for their advantage my ardour was damped and my zeal discouraged by a few slight disappointments i did not consider that there is often amongst uncultivated people a mixture of obstinate and lazy content which makes them despise the luxuries of their richer neighbours like those mountaineers who proud of their own hard fare80 out of a singular species of contempt call the inhabitants of the plains mangerotis eaters of roast meat i did not consider that it must take time to change local and national habits and prejudices and that it is necessary to raise a taste for comforts before they can be properly enjoyed in the pettishness of my disappointment i decided that it was in vain to attempt to improve and civilize such people as the irish i did not recollect perhaps at that time i did not know that even in the days of the great queen elizabeth the greatest part of the buildings in the cities and good towns of england consisted only of timber cast over with thick clay to keep out the wind the new houses of the nobility were indeed either of brick or stone and glass windows were then beginning to be used in england81 and clean rushes were strewed over the dirty floors of the royal palace in the impatience of my zeal for improvement i expected to do the work of two hundred years in a few months and because i could not accelerate the progress of refinement in this miraculous manner i was out of humour with myself and with a whole nation so easily is the humanity of the rich and great disgusted and discouraged as if any people could be civilized in a moment and at the word of command of ignorant pride or despotic benevolence </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ix he sawand but that admiration had been too active too like passion or had he been to ton less true cupid had shot him through and through i have not thought it necessary to record every visit that i received from </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> from all my country neighbours but i must now mention one which led to important consequences a visit from sir harry ormsby a very young dashing man of fortune who in expectation of the happy moment when he should be of age resided with his mother the dowager lady ormsby her ladyship had heard that there had been some disagreement between her agent mr hardcastle and my people but she took the earliest opportunity of expressing her wishes that our families should be on an amicable footing lady ormsby was just come to the country with a large party of her fashionable friendssome irish some english lord and lady kilrush my lady kildangan and her daughter the lady geraldine the knowing widow oconnor the english dasher lady hauton the interesting mrs norton separated but not parted from her husband the pleasant miss bland the three miss ormsbys better known by the name of the swanlinbar graces two english aidesdecamp from the castle and a brace of brigadiers besides other men of inferior note i perceived that sir harry ormsby took it for granted that i must be acquainted with the pretensions of all these persons to celebrity his talkativeness and my taciturnity favoured me so fortunately that he never discovered the extent of my ignorance he was obligingly impatient to make me personally acquainted with those of whom i must have heard so much in england observing that ormsby villa was too far from glenthorn castle for a morning visit he pressed me to waive ceremony and to do lady ormsby and him the honour of spending a week with them as soon as i could make it convenient i accepted this invitation partly from a slight emotion of curiosity and partly from my habitual inability to resist any reiterated importunity arrived at ormsby villa and introduced to this crowd of people i was at first disappointed by seeing nothing extraordinary i expected that their manners would have been as strange to me as some of their names appeared but whether it was from my want of the powers of discrimination or from the real sameness of the objects i could scarcely in this fashionable flock discern any individual marks of distinction at first view the married ladies appeared much the same as those of a similar class in england whom i had been accustomed to see the young ladies i thought as usual best distinguished by black brown and fair but i had not yet seen lady geraldine and a great part of the conversation the first day i was at ormsby villa was filled with lamentations on the unfortunate toothache which prevented her ladyship from appearing she was talked of so much and as a person of such importance and so essential to the amusement of society that i could not help feeling a slight wish to see her the next day at breakfast she did not appear but five minutes before dinner her ladyships humble companion whispered now lady geraldine is coming my lord i was always rather displeased to be called upon to attend to any thing or any body yet as lady geraldine entered i gave one involuntary glance of curiosity i saw a tall finelyshaped woman with the commanding air of a woman of rank she moved well not with feminine timidity but with ease promptitude and decision she had fine eyes and a fine complexion yet no regularity of feature the only thing that struck me as really extraordinary was her indifference when i was introduced to her every body had seemed extremely desirous that i should see her ladyship and that her ladyship should see me and i was rather surprised by her unconcerned air this piqued me and fixed my attention she turned from me and began to converse with others her voice was agreeable she did not speak with the irish accent but when i listened maliciously i detected certain hibernian inflections nothing of the vulgar irish idiom but something that was more interrogative more exclamatory and perhaps more rhetorical than the common language of english ladies accompanied with much animation of countenance and demonstrative gesture this appeared to me peculiar and unusual but not affected she was uncommonly eloquent and yet without action her words were not sufficiently rapid to express her ideas her manner appeared foreign yet it was not quite french if i had been obliged to decide i should however have pronounced it rather more french than english to determine what it was or whether i had ever seen any thing similar i stood considering her ladyship with more attention than i had ever bestowed on any other woman the words strikingfascinatingbewitching </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> strikingfascinatingbewitching occurred to me as i looked at her and heard her speak i resolved to turn my eyes away and shut my ears for i was positively determined not to like her i dreaded so much the idea of a second hymen i retreated to the farthest window and looked out very soberly upon a dirty fishpond dinner was announced i observed lady kildangan manoeuvring to place me beside her daughter geraldine but lady geraldine counteracted this movement i was again surprised and piqued after yielding the envied position to one of the swanlinbar graces i heard lady geraldine whisper to her next neighbour baffled mamma it was strange to me to feel piqued by a young ladys not choosing to sit beside me after dinner i left the gentlemen as soon as possible because the conversation wearied me lord kilrush the chief orator was a courtier and could talk of nothing but dublin castle and my lord lieutenants levees the moment that i went to the ladies i was seized upon by the officious miss bland she could not speak of any thing but lady geraldine who sat at so great a distance and who was conversing with such animation herself that she could not hear her prneuse miss bland inform me that her friend lady geraldine was extremely clever so clever that many people were at first a little afraid of her but that there was not the least occasion for that where she liked nobody could be more affable and engaging this judicious friend a minute afterwards told me as a very great secret that lady geraldine was an admirable mimic that she could draw or speak caricatures that she was also wonderfully happy in the invention of agnomens and cognomens so applicable to the persons that they could scarcely be forgotten or forgiven i was a little anxious to know whether her ladyship would honour me with an agnomen i could not learn this from miss bland and i was too prudent to betray my curiosity i afterwards heard it however pairing me and mr mleod whom she had seen together her ladyship observed that sawney and yawney were made for each other and she sketched in strong caricature my relaxed elongation of limb and his rigid rectangularity a slight degree of fear of lady geraldines powers kept my attention alert in the course of the evening lady kildangan summoned her daughter to the musicroom and asked me to come and hear an irish song i exerted myself so far as to follow immediately but though summoned lady geraldine did not obey miss bland tuned the harp and opened the musicbooks on the piano but no lady geraldine appeared miss bland was sent backwards and forwards with messages but lady geraldines ultimatum was that she could not possibly sing because she was afraid of the toothache god knows her mouth had never been shut all the evening well but said lady kildangan she can play for us cannot she no her ladyship was afraid of the cold in the musicroom do my lord glenthorn go and tell the dear capricious creature that we are very warm here very reluctantly i obeyed the lady geraldine with her circle round her heard and answered me with the air of a princess do you the honour to play for you my lord excuse me i am no professori play so ill that i make it a rule never to play but for my own amusement if you wish for music there is miss bland she plays incomparably and i dare say will think herself happy to oblige your lordship i never felt so silly or so much abashed as at this instant this comes thought i of acting out of character what possessed me to exert myself to ask a lady to play i that have been tired to death of music why did i let myself be sent ambassador when i had no interest in the embassy to convince myself and others of my apathy i threw myself on a sofa and never stirred or spoke the remainder of the night i presume i appeared fast asleep else lady geraldine would not have said within my hearing mamma wants me to catch somebody and to be caught by somebody but that will not be for do you know i think somebody is nobody i was offended as much as it was in my nature to be offended and i began to meditate apologies for shortening my visit at ormsby villa but though i was shocked by the haughtiness of lady geraldine and accused her in my own mind of want of delicacy and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> and politeness yet i could not now suspect her of being an accomplice with her mother in any matrimonial designs upon me from the moment i was convinced of this my conviction was i suppose visible to her ladyships penetrating eyes and from that instant she showed me that she could be polite and agreeable now soothed to a state of ease and complacency i might have sunk to indifference and ennui but fresh singularities in this lady struck me and kept my attention awake and fixed upon her character if she had treated me with tolerable civility at first i never should have thought about her highborn and highbred she seemed to consider more what she thought of others than what others thought of her frank candid and affable yet opinionated insolent and an egotist her candour and affability appeared the effect of a naturally good temper her insolence and egotism only those of a spoiled child she seemed to talk of herself purely to oblige others as the most interesting possible topic of conversation for such it had always been to her fond mother who idolized her ladyship as an only daughter and the representative of an ancient house confident of her talents conscious of her charms and secure of her station lady geraldine gave free scope to her high spirits her fancy and her turn for ridicule she looked spoke and acted like a person privileged to think say and do what she pleased her raillery like the raillery of princes was without fear of retort she was not illnatured yet careless to whom she gave offence provided she produced amusement and in this she seldom failed for in her conversation there was much of the raciness of irish wit and the oddity of irish humour the singularity that struck me most about her ladyship was her indifference to flattery she certainly preferred frolic miss bland was her humble companion miss tracey her butt her ladyship appeared to consider miss bland as a necessary appendage to her rank and person like her dress or her shadow and she seemed to think no more of the one than of the other she suffered miss bland to follow her but she would go in quest of n miss tracey miss bland was allowed to speak but her ladyship listened to miss tracey miss bland seldom obtained an answer but miss tracey never opened her lips without a repartee in describing miss tracey lady geraldine said poor simpleton she cannot help imitating all she sees us do yet would you believe it she really has starts of common sense and some tolerable ideas of her own spoiled by bad company in the language of the birdfanciers she has a few notes nightingale and all the rest rubbish it was one of lady geraldines delights to humour miss traceys rage for imitating the fashions of fine people now you shall see miss tracey appear at the ball tomorrow in every thing that i have sworn to her is fashionable nor have i cheated her in a single article but the tout ensemble i leave to her better judgment and you shall see her i trust a perfect monster formed of every creatures best lady kilrushs feathers mrs moores wig mrs oconnors gown mrs lightons sleeves and all the necklaces of all the miss ormsbys she has no taste no judgment none at all poor thing but she can imitate as well as those chinese painters who in their drawings give you the flower of one plant stuck on the stalk of another and garnished with the leaves of a third miss traceys appearance the ensuing night justified all lady geraldines predictions and surpassed her ladyships most sanguine hopes even i albeit unused to the laughing mood could not forbear smiling at the humour and ease with which her ladyship played off this girls credulous vanity at breakfast the next morning lord kilrush in his grave manner always too solemn by half for the occasion declared that no man was more willing than himself to enter into a jest in proper time and season and measure and so forth but that it was really positively morally unjustifiable in his apprehension the making this poor girl so publicly ridiculous my good lord replied lady geraldine all the world are ridiculous some way or other some in public some in private now continued she with an appealing look to the whole company now after all what is there more extravagant in my miss traceys delighting at sixteen in six yards of pink riband than in your courtier sighing at sixty for three yards of blue riband or what is there </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> there more ridiculous in her coming simpering into a ballroom fancying herself the mirror of fashion when she is a figure for a printshop than in the courtier rising solemnly in the house of lords believing himself an orator and expecting to make a vast reputation by picking up in every debate the very worst arguments that every body else let fall there would be no living in this world if we were all to see and expose one anothers ridicules my plan is much the bestto help my friends to expose themselves and then they are infinitely obliged to me satisfied with silencing all opposition and seeing that the majority was with her lady geraldine persisted in her course and i was glad she was incorrigible because her faults entertained me as to love i thought i was perfectly safe because though i admired her quickness and cleverness yet i still at times perceived or fancied i perceived some want of polish and elegance and tact she was not exactly cut out according to my english pattern of a woman of fashion so i thought i might amuse myself without danger as it was partly at her ladyships expense but about this time i was alarmed for myself by a slight twinge of jealousy as i was standing lounging upon the steps at the halldoor almost as ennuy as usual i saw a carriage at a distance between the trees driving up the approach and at the same instant i heard lady geraldines eager voice in the hall oh they are coming he is coming they are come run miss bland run and give lord craiglethorpe my message before he gets out of the carriagebefore any body sees him afraid of hearing what i should not hear i walked down the steps deliberately and turned into a shrubberywalk to leave the coast clear out ran miss bland and then it was that i felt the twingevery slight however who is this lord craiglethorpe with whom lady geraldine is on such favourable terms i wonder what kind of looking man he is and what could the message meanbut at all events it cannot concern me yet i am curious to see this lord craiglethorpe i wonder any woman can like a man with so strange a name but does she like him after allwhy do i plague myself about it as i returned from my saunter i was met by miss bland a charming day maam said i endeavouring to pass on a charming day my lord but i must stop your lordship a moment oh i am so out of breathi went the wrong way the wrong way indeed i am sorry i am concerned you should have had so much trouble no trouble in the world only i want to beg youll keep our secretmy lady geraldines secret undoubtedly madama man of honourlady geraldine cannot doubther ladyships secret is perfectly safe but do you know it you dont know it yet my lord pardon me i was on the steps just now i thought you saw me i did my lordbut i dont understand nor i neither interrupted i half laughing for i began to think i was mistaken in my suspicions pray explain yourself my dear miss bland i was very rude to be so quick in interrupting you miss bland then made me the confidant of a charming scheme of lady geraldines for quizzing miss tracey she has never in her life seen lord craiglethorpe who is an english lord travelling through ireland continued miss bland now you must know that miss tracey is passionately fond of lords let them be what they may now lord craiglethorpe this very morning sent his groom with a note and excuse to lady ormsby for not coming to us today because he said he was bringing down in the chaise with him a surveyor to survey his estate near here and he could not possibly think of bringing the surveyor who is a low man to ormsby villa but lady ormsby would take no apology and wrote by the groom to beg that lord craiglethorpe would make no scruple of bringing the surveyor for you know she is so polite and accommodating and all that well the note was scarcely gone before lady geraldine thought of her charming scheme and regretted of all things she had not put it into it it into it repeated i to myself maam said i looking a little bewildered but continued my clear narrator i promised to remedy all that by running to meet the carriage which was what i ran for when you saw me my lord in </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> in such a hurry i bowedand was as wise as ever so my lord you comprehend that the surveyor whose name whose odious name is gabbitt is to be my lord craiglethorpe and my lord craiglethorpe is to be passed for mr gabbitt upon miss tracey and you will see miss tracey will admire mr gabbitt prodigiously and call him vastly genteel when she thinks him a lord your lordship will keep our secret and she is sure lord craiglethorpe will do any thing to oblige her because he is a near connexion of hers but i assure you it is not every body could get lord craiglethorpe to join in a joke for he is very stiff and cold and high of course your lordship will know which is the real lord at first sight he is a full head taller than gabbitt never was explanation finally more satisfactory and whether the jest was really well contrived and executed or whether i was put into a humour to think so i cannot exactly determine but i confess i was amused with the scenes that followed though i felt that they were not quite justifiable even in jest the admiration of miss tracey for the false craiglethorpe as lady geraldine called mr gabbitt the awkwardness of mr gabbitt with his title and the awkwardness of lord craiglethorpe without it were fine subjects of her ladyships satirical humour in another point of view lord craiglethorpe afforded her ladyship amusement as an english traveller full of english prejudices against ireland and every thing irish whenever miss tracey was out of the room lady geraldine allowed lord craiglethorpe to be himself again but he did not fare the better for this restoration to his honours lady geraldine contrived to make him as ridiculous in his real as in his assumed character lord craiglethorpe was as miss bland had described him very stiff cold and high his manners were in the extreme of english reserve and his illbred show of contempt for the irish was sufficient provocation and justification of lady geraldines ridicule he was much in awe of his fair and witty cousin she could easily put him out of countenance for he was extremely bashful his lordship had that sort of bashfulness which makes a man surly and obstinate in his taciturnity which makes him turn upon all who approach him as if they were going to assault him which makes him answer a question as if it were an injury and repel a compliment as if it were an insult once when he was out of the room lady geraldine exclaimed that cousin craiglethorpe of mine is scarcely an agreeable man the awkwardness of mauvaise honte might be pitied and pardoned even in a nobleman continued her ladyship if it really proceeded from humility but here when i know it is connected with secret and inordinate arrogance tis past all endurance even his ways of sitting and standing provoke me they are so selfsufficient have you observed how he stands at the fire oh the caricature of the english fireside outdone then if he sits we hope that change of posture may afford our eyes transient relief but worse again bolstered up with his back against his chair his hands in his pockets and his legs thrown out in defiance of all passengers and all decorum there he sits in magisterial silence throwing a gloom upon all conversation as the frenchman said of the englishman for whom even his politeness could not find another compliment il faut avouer que ce monsieur a un grand talent pour le silence he holds his tongue till the people actually believe that he has something to say a mistake they could never fall into if he would but speak some of the company attempted to interpose a word or two in favour of lord craiglethorpes timidity but the vivacious and merciless lady went on i tell you my good friends it is not timidityit is all pride i would pardon his dulness and even his ignorance for one as you say might be the fault of his nature and the other of his education but his selfsufficiency is his own fault and that i will not and cannot pardon somebody says that nature may make a fool but a coxcomb is always of his own making now my cousinas he is my cousin i may say what i please of himmy cousin craiglethorpe is a solemn coxcomb who thinks because his vanity is not talkative and sociable that its not vanity what a mistake his silent superciliousness is to me more intolerable than the most garrulous egotism that ever laid itself </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> itself open to my ridicule miss bland and miss ormsby both confessed that lord craiglethorpe was vastly too silent for the honour of my country continued lady geraldine i am determined to make this man talk and he shall say all that i know he thinks of us poor irish savages if he would but speak one could answer him if he would find fault one might defend if he would laugh one might perhaps laugh again but here he comes to hospitable openhearted ireland eats as well as he can in his own country drinks better than he can in his own country sleeps as well as he can in his own country accepts all our kindness without a word or a look of thanks and seems the whole time to think that born for his use we live but to oblige him there he is at this instant look at him walking in the park with his notebook in his hand setting down our faults and conning them by rote we are even with him i understand lady kilrush that my bright cousin craiglethorpe means to write a book a great book upon ireland lady kilrush replied that she understood lord craiglethorpe had it in contemplation to publish a tour through ireland or a view of ireland or something of that nature he with his means of acquiring information exclaimed lady geraldine posting from one great mans house to another what can he see or know of the manners of any rank of people but of the class of gentry which in england and ireland is much the same as to the lower classes i dont think he ever speaks to them or if he does what good can it do him for he cant understand their modes of expression nor they his if he inquire about a matter of fact i defy him to get the truth out of them if they dont wish to tell it and for some reason or other they will nine times in ten not wish to tell it to an englishman there is not a man woman or child in any cabin in ireland who would not have wit and cuteness enough to make my lard believe just what they please so after posting from dublin to cork and from the giants causeway to killarney after travelling east west north and south my wise cousin craiglethorpe will know just as much of the lower irish as the cockney who has never been out of london and who has never in all his born days seen an irishman but on the english stage where the representations are usually as like the originals as the chinese pictures of lions drawn from description are to the real animal now now look at his lordship cried miss bland he has his notebook out again mercy on us said miss callwell how he is writing yes yes write on my good cousin craiglethorpe pursued lady geraldine and nil the little notebook which will soon turn to a ponderous quarto i shall have a copy bound in morocco no doubt from the author if i behave myself prettily and i will earn it by supplying valuable information you shall see my friends how ill deserve well of my country if youll only keep my counsel and your own countenances presently lord craiglethorpe entered the room walking very pompously and putting his notebook up as he advanced oh my dear lord open the book again i have a bull for you lady geraldine after putting his lordship in good humour by this propitiatory offering of a bull continued to supply him either directly or indirectly by some of her confederates with the most absurd anecdotes incredible facts stale jests and blunders such as were never made by trueborn irishmen all which my lord craiglethorpe took down with an industrious sobriety at which the spectators could scarcely refrain from laughing sometimes he would pause and exclaim a capital anecdote a curious fact may i give my authority may i quote your ladyship yes if youll pay me a compliment in the preface whispered lady geraldine and now dear cousin do go up stairs and put it all in ink when she had despatched the noble author her ladyship indulged her laughter but now cried she only imagine a set of sober english readers studying my cousin craiglethorpes new view of ireland and swallowing all the nonsense it will contain when lord kilrush remonstrated against the cruelty of letting the man publish such stuff and represented it as a fraud upon the public lady geraldine laughed still more and exclaimed surely you dont think i would </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> would use the public and my poor cousin so ill no i am doing him and the public the greatest possible service just when he is going to leave us when the writingbox is packed i will step up to him and tell him the truth i will show him what a farrago of nonsense he has collected as materials for his quarto and convince him at once how utterly unfit he is to write a book at least a book on irish affairs wont this be deserving well of my country and of my cousin neither on this occasion nor on any other were the remonstrances of my lord kilrush of power to stop the course of this ladys flow of spirits and raillery whilst she was going on in this manner with the real lord craiglethorpe miss tracey was taking charming walks in the park with mr gabbitt and the young lady began to be seriously charmed with her false lord this was carrying the jest farther than lady geraldine had intended or foreseen and her goodnature would probably have disposed her immediately to dissolve the enchantment had she not been provoked by the interference of lord kilrush and the affected sensibility of miss clementina ormsby who to give me an exalted opinion of her delicacy expostulated incessantly in favour of the deluded fair one but my dear lady geraldine i do assure you it really hurts my feelings this is going too farwhen it comes to the heart i cant laugh i ownthe poor girls affections will be engagedshe is really falling in love with this odious surveyor but now my dear clementina i do assure you it really hurts my feelings to hear you talk so childishly when it comes to the heart affections engaged you talk of falling in love as if it were a terrible fall for my part i should pity a person much more for falling down stairs why my dear where is the mighty height from which miss tracey could fall she does not live in the clouds clementina as you do no ladies live there now for the best of all possible reasons because there are no men there so my love make haste and come down before you are out of your teens or you may chance to be left there till you are an angel or an old maid trust me my dear i who have tried tell you there is no such thing as falling in love nowadays you may slip slide or stumble but to fall in love i defy you i saw lady kildangans eyes fix upon me as her daughter pronounced the last sentence geraldine my dear you do not know what you are talking about said her ladyship your time may come geraldine nobody should be too courageous cupid does not like to be defied lady kildangan walked away as she spoke with a very wellsatisfied air leaving a party of us young people together lady geraldine looked haughtily vexed when in this mood her wit gave no quarter spared neither sex nor age every body says whispered she that mamma is the most artful woman in the world and i should believe it only that every body says it now if it were true nobody would know it lady geraldines air of disdain towards me was resumed i did not quite understand was it pride was it coquetry she certainly blushed deeply and for the first time that i ever saw her blush when her mother said your time may come geraldine my week being now at an end i resolved to take my leave when i announced this resolution i was assailed with the most pressing entreaties to stay a few days longerone day longer lady ormsby and sir harry said every thing that could be said upon the occasion indeed it seemed a matter of general interest to all except to lady geraldine she appeared wholly indifferent and i was not even gratified by any apparent affectation of desiring my departure curiosity to see whether this would be sustained by her ladyship to the last gave me resolution sufficient to resist the importunities of sir harry and i departed rejoicing that my indifference was equal to her ladyships as tasso said of some fair one whom he met at the carnival of mantua i ran some risk of falling in love i had been so far roused from my habitual apathy that i actually made some reflections as i returned home i began to perceive that there was some difference between woman and woman besides the distinctions of rank fortune and figure i think i owe </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> owe to lady geraldine my first relish for wit and my first idea that a woman might be if not a reasonable at least a companionable animal i compared her ladyship with the mere puppets and parrots of fashion of whom i had been wearied and i began to suspect that one might find in a ladys lively nonsense a relief from ennui these reflections however did not prevent me from sleeping the greatest part of the morning on my way home nor did i dream of any thing that i can remember at the porters lodge i saw ellinor sitting at her spinningwheel and my thoughts took up my domestic affairs just where i had left them the preceding week </chapter>

<chapter>chapter x in vain i attempted to interest myself in my domestic affairs the silence and solitude of my own castle appeared to me intolerably melancholy after my return from ormsby villa there was a blank in my existence during a week in which i can remember nothing that i did said or thought except what passed during one ride which mr mcleod compelled my politeness to take with him he came with the same face to see me and the same set of ideas as those he had before i went to ormsby villa he began to talk of my schemes for improving my tenantry and of my wish that he should explain his notions relative to the education of the poor of ireland which he said as i now seemed to be at leisure he was ready to do as concisely as possible as concisely as possible were the only words of his address that i heard with satisfaction but of course i bowed said i was much obliged and i should be happy to have the advantage of mr mleods opinions and sentiments what these were i cannot recollect for i settled myself in a reverie soon after his voice began to sound upon my ear but i remember at last he wakened me by proposing that i should ride with him to see a schoolhouse and some cottages which he had built on a little estate of his own in my neighbourhood for said he tis better my lord to show you what can be done with these people than to talk of what might be effected very true said i agreeing readily because i wanted to finish a conversation that wearied me and to have a refreshing ride it was a delightful evening and when we came on mleods estate i really could not help being pleased and interested in an unfavourable situation with all nature vegetable and animal against him he had actually created a paradise amid the wilds there was nothing wonderful in any thing i saw around me but there was such an air of neatness and comfort order and activity in the people and in their cottages that i almost thought myself in england and i could not forbear exclaiminghow could all this be brought about in ireland chiefly by not doing and not expecting too much at first said mleod we took time and had patience we began by setting them the example of some very slight improvements and then lured on by the sight of success they could make similar trials themselves my wife and i went among them and talked to them in their cottages and took an interest in their concerns and did not want to have every thing our own way and when they saw that they began to consider which way was best so by degrees we led where we could not have driven and raised in them by little and little a taste for conveniences and comforts then the business was done for the moment the taste and ambition were excited to work the people went to gratify them and according as they exerted themselves we helped them perhaps it was best for them and for us that we were not rich for we could not do too much at a time and were never tempted to begin grand schemes that we could not finish there said mcleod pointing to a cottage with a pretty porch covered with woodbine and a neat garden in which many children were busily at work that house and that garden were the means of doing all the rest that is our schoolhouse we could not expect to do much with the old whose habits were fixed but we tried to give the young children better notions and it was a long time before we could bring that to bear twentysix years we have been at this work and in that time if we </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> we have done any thing it was by beginning with the children a race of our own training has now grown up and they go on in the way they were taught and prosper to our hearts content and what is better still to their hearts content mcleod habitually grave and taciturn seemed quite enlivened and talkative this day but i verily believe that not the slightest ostentation or vanity inspired him for i never before or since heard him talk or allude to his own good deeds i am convinced his motive was to excite me to persevere in my benevolent projects by showing what had been done by small means he was so truly in earnest that he never perceived how tired i was indeed he was so little in the habit of expecting sympathy or applause that he never missed even the ordinary expressions of concurrent complaisance religion continued he is the great difficulty in ireland we make no difference between protestants and catholics we always have admitted both into our school the priest comes on saturday morning and the parish minister on saturday evening to hear the children belonging to each church their catechisms and to instruct them in the tenets of their faith and as we keep to our word and never attempt making proselytes nor directly or indirectly interfere with their religious opinions the priests are glad to let us instruct the catholic children in all other points which they plainly see must advance their temporal interests mr mcleod invited me to go in and look at the school in a hedge or ditch school said he which i once passed on this road and in which i saw a crowd of idle children i heard the schoolmaster cry out rehearse rehearse theres company going by and instantly all the boys snatched up their books and began gabbling as fast as ever they could to give an idea to the passenger of their diligence in repeating their lessons but here my lord continued mleod you will not see any exhibitions got up for company i hate such tricks walk in my lord if you please i walked in but am ashamed to say that i observed only that every thing looked as if it had been used for many years and yet not worn out and the whole school appeared as if all were in their places and occupied and intent upon their business but this general recollection is all i have retained the enthusiasm for improvement had subsided in my mind and though i felt a transient pleasure in the present picture of the happiness of these poor people and their healthy children yet as i rode home the images faded away like a dream i resolved indeed at some future period to surpass all that mr mleod had done or all that with his narrow income he could ever accomplish and to this resolution i was prompted by jealousy of this man rather than by benevolence before i had arranged even in imagination my plans young ormsby came one morning and pressed me to return with him to ormsby villa i yielded to his solicitations and to my own wishes when i arrived the ladies were all at their toilettes except miss bland who was in the bookroom with the gentlemen ready to receive me with her perpetual smile wherever miss bland went she was always lamie de la maison accustomed to share with the lady of the house the labour of entertaining her guests this double of lady ormsby talked to me most courteously of all the nothings of the day and informed me of the changes which had taken place in the evervarying succession of company at ormsby villa the two brigadiers and one of the aidesdecamp were gone but captain andrews another castle aidedecamp was come and my lord otoole had arrived then followed a byconversation between miss bland and some of the gentlemen about the joy and sorrow which his lordships arrival would create in the hearts of two certain ladies one of whom as i gathered from the innuendoes was lady hauton and the other lady otoole as i knew nothing of dublin intrigues and scandal i was little attentive to all this miss bland persisting in entertaining me proceeded to inform me that my lord otoole had brought down with him mr cecil devereux who was a wit and a poet very handsome and gallant and one of the most fashionable young men in dublin i determined not to like himi always hated a flourish of trumpets whoever enters announced in this parading manner appears to disadvantage mr cecil devereux entered just </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> just as the flourish ceased he was not at all the sort of person i was prepared to see though handsome and with the air of a man used to good company there was nothing of a coxcomb in his manner on the contrary there was such an appearance of carelessness about himself and deference towards others that notwithstanding the injudicious praise that had been bestowed on him and my consequent resolution to dislike him i was pleased and familiar with him before i had been ten minutes in his company lord kilrush introduced him to me with great pomposity as a gentleman of talents for whom he and his brother otoole interested themselves much this air of patronage i saw disgusted mr devereux and instead of suffering himself to be shown off he turned the conversation from his own poems to general subjects he asked me some questions about a curious cavern or subterraneous way near glenthorn castle which stretched from the seashore to a considerable distance under the rock and communicated with an old abbey near the castle mr devereux said that such subterraneous places had been formerly used in ireland as granaries by the ancient inhabitants but a gentleman of the neighbourhood who was present observed that the caverns on this coast had within his memory been used as hidingplaces by smugglers on this hint lord kilrush began a prosing dissertation upon smugglers and contraband traders and talked to me a prodigious deal about exports and imports and bounties and the balance of trade not one word he said did i comprehend and i question whether his lordship understood the subjects upon which he spoke so dictatorially but he thought he succeeded in giving me an opinion of his wisdom and information his brother otoole appeared next he did not look like a man of gallantry as i had been taught to expect from the hints thrown out respecting lady hauton his lordships whole soul seemed devoted to ambition and he talked so much of great men and state affairs and court intrigues and honours and preferments that i began to fancy i had been buried alive because i knew little of these things i was tired of hearing him yet mortified that i could not speak exactly in the same manner and with the same air of being the best possible authority i began to wish that i also had some interest at court the cares and troubles of the ambitious man so utterly repugnant to the indolence of my disposition vanished in this moment of infatuation from my view and i thought only of the pleasures of power such is the infectious nature of ambition mr devereux helped me to throw off this dangerous contagion before it did me any injury he happened to stay in the room with me a quarter of an hour after the other gentlemen went to dress though not often disposed to conversation with a stranger yet i was won by this gentlemans easy address he politely talked of the english fashionable world with which he knew that i was well acquainted i with equal politeness recurred to the irish great world we fastened together upon lord otoole who took us to dublin castle and i began to express my regret that i had not yet been at the irish court and that i had not earlier in life made myself of political consequence ambition said i might help to keep a man awake and alive all common pleasures have long since ceased to interest methey really cannot make me stir my lord said mr devereux you would do better to sit or lie still all your life than to toil for such vain objects full little knowest thou that hast not tried what hell it is in sueing long to bide your lordship may remember spensers description of that hell not exactly said i unwilling to lower the good opinion this gentleman seemed to have taken for granted of my literature he took spensers poems out of the bookcase and i actually rose from my seat to read the passage for what trouble will not even the laziest of mortals take to preserve the esteem of one by whom he sees that he is overvalued i read the following ten lines without yawning full little knowest thou that hast not tried what hell it is in sueing long to bide to lose good days that might be better spent to waste long nights in pensive discontent to speed today to be put back tomorrow to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow to fret thy soul with crosses and with cares to eat </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> eat thy heart through comfortless despairs to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run to spend to give to want to be undone very strong indeed said i with a competent air as if used to judge of poetry and it comes with still greater force when we consider by whom it was written a man you know my lord who had been secretary to a lord lieutenant i felt my nascent ambition die away within me i acknowledged it was better to spend an easy life my determination was confirmed at this instant by the appearance of lady geraldine ambition and love it is said are incompatible passions neither of them had yet possession of my heart but love and lady geraldine had perhaps a better chance than ambition and lord otoole lady geraldine appeared in high spirits and though i was not a vain man i could not help fancying that my return to ormsby villa contributed to her charming vivacity this gratified me secretly and soberly as much as it visibly delighted her mother miss bland to pay her court to lady kildangan observed that lady geraldine was in uncommonly fine spirits this evening lady geraldine threw back a haughty frown over her left shoulder this was the only time i ever saw her notice in any manner any thing that fell from her obsequious friend to avert the fair ones displeasure i asked for miss tracey and mr gabbitt mr gabbitt said her ladyship resuming her goodhumour instantly mr gabbitt is gone off the happiest man in ireland with the hopes of surveying my lord otooles estate a good job which i was bound in honour to obtain for him as a reward for taking a good joke after mocking him with the bare imagination of a feast you know the barmecide in the arabian tales gave poor shakabac a substantial dinner a full equivalent for the jest and miss tracey said i what did your ladyship do for her i persuaded her mamma that the sweet creature was falling into an atrophy so she carried the forlorn damsel post haste to the black rock for the recovery of her health or her heart clementina my dear no reproachful looks in your secret soul do not you know that i could not do a young lady a greater favour than to give her a plausible excuse for getting away from home i was afraid that lady geraldine would feel the want of her butt however i found that miss traceys place was supplied by captain andrews one of the castles aidesdecamp and when captain andrews was out of the way lord kilrush and his brother otoole were good marks high and mighty as these personages thought themselves and respectfully nay obsequiously as they were treated by most others to this lady their characters appeared only a good study and to laugh at them seemed only a good practice perhaps my lord said she to me you do not yet know my lord otoole i have had the honour to be introduced to him thats well for he thinks that not to know him argues yourself unknown but as your lordship is a stranger in this country you may be pardoned and i will make you better acquainted with him i suppose you know there are many tooles in ireland some very ancient respectable and useful this however is but a mere political tool and the worst of all tools a cats paw theres one thing to the credit of these brothers they agree vastly well for one delights in being always on the stage and the other always behind the scenes these brothers with captain andrewsi hope they are none of them within hearingform a charming trio all admirable in their way my lord otoole isartifice without art my lord kilrushimportance without power and captain andrewspliability without ease poor andrews hes a defenceless animalsafe in impenetrable armour give him but timeas a man said who once showed me a landtortoisegive him but time to draw his head into his shell and a broadwheeled waggon may go over him without hurting him lord glenthorn did you ever observe captain andrewss mode of conversation no i never heard him converse converse nor i indeed but you have heard him talk i have heard him sayvery trueand of course lord glenthorn is quite severe this evening said mrs oconnor but though your lordship continued lady geraldine may have observed captain andrewss wonderful economy of words do you know whence it arises perhaps you think from his perception of his own want of understanding not from his perception of the want said i again </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> again again said mrs oconnor with an insulting tone of surprise lord glenthorns quite witty this evening lady geraldine looked as if she were fully sensible of the want of politeness in mrs oconnors mode of praising but my lord pursued she you wrong captain andrews if you attribute his monosyllabic replies either to stupidity or timidity you have not guessed the reason why he never gives on any subject more than half an opinion it was in the diplomatic school he was taught that art said mr devereux you must know pursued lady geraldine that captain andrews is only an aidedecamp till a diplomatic situation can be found for him and to do him justice he has been so well trained in the diplomatic school that he will not hazard an assertion on any subject he is not certain of any thing not even of his own identity he assuredly wants said devereux the only proof of existence which descartes would admiti think therefore i am he has such a holy horror of committing himself continued lady geraldine that if you were to ask him if the sun rose this morning he would answer with his sweet smileso i am toldorso i am informed begging your ladyships pardon cried mr devereux that is much too affirmative in the pure diplomatic style impersonal verbs must ever be used in preference to active or passive so i am told lays him open to the dangerous questions who told you or by whom were you informed then he is forced into the imprudence of giving up his authorities whereas he is safe in the impersonality of so it is said or so it is reported how i should like to see a meeting between two perfectly finished diplomatists cried lady geraldine that is demonstrably impossible said mr devereux for in certain political as well as in certain geometrical lines there is a continual effort to approach without a possibility of meeting lady geraldines raillery like all other things would perhaps soon have become tiresome to me but that there was infinite variety in her humour at first i had thought her merely superficial and intent solely upon her own amusement but i soon found that she had a taste for literature beyond what could have been expected in one who lived so dissipated a life a depth of reflection that seemed inconsistent with the rapidity with which she thought and above all a degree of generous indignation against meanness and vice which seemed incompatible with the selfish character of a fine lady and which appeared quite incomprehensible to the imitating tribe of her fashionable companions i mentioned a mrs norton and lady hauton amongst the company of ormsby villa these two english ladies whom i had never met in any of the higher circles in london who were persons of no consequence and of no marked character in their own country made it seems a prodigious sensation when they came over to ireland and turned the heads of half dublin by the extravagance of their dress the impertinence of their airs and the audacity of their conduct fame flew before them to the remote parts of the country and when they arrived at ormsby villa all the country gentlemen and ladies were prepared to admire these celebrated fashionable belles all worshipped them present and abused them absent except lady geraldine who neither joined in the admiration nor inquired into the scandal one morning mrs norton and lady hauton had each collected her votaries round her one group begging patterns of dress from lady hauton who stood up in the midst of them to have everything she wore examined and envied the other group sat on a sofa apart listening to mrs norton who sotto voce was telling interesting anecdotes of an english crim con which then occupied the attention of the fashionable world mrs norton had letters from the best authorities in london which she was entreated by her auditors to read to them mrs norton went to look for the letters lady hauton to direct her woman to furnish some patterns of i know not what articles of dress and in the mean time all the company joined in canvassing the merits and demerits of the dress and characters of the two ladies who had just left the room lady geraldine who had kept aloof and who was examining some prints at the farther end of the room at this instant laid down her book and looked upon the whole party with an air of magnanimous disdain then smiling as in scorn she advanced towards them and in a tone of irony addressing one of the swanlinbar </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> swanlinbar graces my dear theresa said her ladyship you are absolutely ashamed i see of not being quite naked and you my good bess will no doubt very soon be equally scandalized at the imputation of being a perfectly modest woman go on my friends go on and prosper beg and borrow all the patterns and precedents you can collect of the newest fashions of folly and vice make haste make haste they dont reach our remote island fast enough we irish might live in innocence half a century longer if you didnt expedite the progress of profligacy we might escape the plague that rages in neighbouring countries if we didnt without any quarantine and with open arms welcome every suspected stranger if we didnt encourage the importation of whole bales of tainted fineries that will spread the contagion from dublin to cork and from cork to galway la said miss ormsby how severe your ladyship is and all only for ones asking for a pattern but you know pursued mrs oconnor that lady geraldine is too proud to take pattern from any body too proud am i well then ill be humble ill abase myselfshall i proud as i am ill put myself to school and ill do what the ladies hauton and norton shall advise to heighten my charms and preserve my reputation i must begin must not i mrs oconnor by learning not to blush for i observed you were ashamed for me yesterday at dinner when i blushed at something said by one of our fair missionaries then to whatever lengths flirtations and gallantry may go between unmarried or married people i must look on i may shut my eyes if i please and look down but not from shamefrom affectation i may as often as i please or to show my eyelashes memorandumto practise this before clementina ormsby my mirror of fashion so far so good for my looks but now for my language i must reform my barbarous language and learn from mrs norton with her pretty accommodating voice to call an intrigue an arrangement and a crim con an affair in doctors commons or that business before the lords we never mention hell to ears polite how virtuous we shall be when we have no name for vice but stay i must mind my lessonsi have more much more to learn from the dashing lady hauton i may learn if my head be but strong and my courage intrepid enough to touch the brink of all we hate without tumbling headlong into the gulf and from the interesting mrs norton as i hear it whispered amongst you ladies i may learn how with the assistance of a humanesociety to save a halfdrowned reputation it is i understand the glory of one class of fashionable females to seem worse than they are and of another class the privilege to be worse than they seem here clamorous voices interrupted lady geraldinesome justifying some attacking lady hauton and mrs norton oh lady geraldine i assure you notwithstanding all that was said about general and mrs norton i am convinced there was nothing in it and my dear lady geraldine though lady hauton does go great lengths in coquetting with a certain lord you must see that theres nothing wrong and that she means nothing but to provoke his ladys jealousy you know his lordship is not a man to fall in love with so because lady hautons passion is hatred instead of love and because her sole object is to give pain to a poor wife and to make mischief in families all her sins are to be forgiven now if i were forced to forgive any illconducted female i would rather excuse the woman who is hurried on by love than she who is instigated by hatred miss bland now began to support her ladyships opinion that lady hauton was much the worst of the two and all the scandal that was in circulation was produced by the partisans of each of these ladies no matter no matter which is the worst cried lady geraldine dont let us waste our time in repeating or verifying scandalous stories of either of them i have no enmity to these ladies i only despise them or rather their follies and their faults it is not the sinner but the sin we should reprobate oh my dear countrywomen cried lady geraldine with increasing animation of countenance and manneroh my dear countrywomen let us never stoop to admire and imitate these secondhand airs and graces follies and vices let us dare to be ourselves my eyes were fixed upon her animated countenance and i believe i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> i continued gazing even after her voice ceased mrs oconnor pointed this out and i was immediately embarrassed miss bland accounted for my embarrassment by supposing that what lady geraldine had said of english crim cons had affected me from a look and a whisper among the ladies i guessed this but lady geraldine was too wellbred to suppose i could suspect her of illbreeding and illnature or that i could apply to myself what evidently was not intended to allude to my family misfortunes by an openness of manner and sweetness of expression which i cannot forget she in one single look conveyed all this to me and then resuming her conversation pray my lord said she you who have lived so much in the great world in england say for you can whether i am right or wrong in my suspicion that these ladies who have made such a noise in ireland have been little heard of in england i confirmed her ladyships opinion by my evidence the faces of the company changed thus in a few seconds the empire of lady hauton and of mrs norton seemed shaken to the foundation and never recovered from this shock the warmth of lady geraldines expressions on this and many other occasions wakened dormant feelings in my heart and made me sensible that i had a soul and that i was superior to the puppets with whom i had been classed one day lady kilrush in her mixed mode with partly the graces of a fine lady and partly the airs of a bel esprit was talking of mr devereux whom she affected to patronise and produce here devereux cried she cecil devereux what can you be thinking of i am talking to you heres this epitaph of francis the first upon petrarchs laura that you showed me the other day do you know i dote upon it i must have it translated nobody can do it so well as you i have not time but i shall not sleep tonight if it is not done and you are so quick so sit down here theres a dear man and do it in your elegant way for me whilst i go to my toilette perhaps you did not know that my name was laura said she leaving the room with a very sentimental air what will become of me cried devereux never was a harder task set by cruel patroness i would rather turn a persian tale for halfacrown read this my lord and tell me whether it will be easy to turn my lady kilrush into petrarchs laura this sonnet to be sure is rather difficult to translate or at least to modernize as bespoke said lady geraldine after she had perused the sonnet82 but i think mr devereux you brought this difficulty upon yourself how came you to show these lines to such an amateur such a fetcher and carrier of bays as lady kilrush you might have been certain that had they been trash with the name of francis the first and with your fashionable approbation and something to say about petrarch and laura my lady kilrush would talk for ever et se pmerait daffectation mr devereux said i has only to abide by the last lines as a good and sufficient apology to lady kilrush for his silence qui te pourra louer quen se taisant car la parole est toujours rprime quand le sujet surmonte le disant there is no way to get out of my difficulties said mr devereux with a very melancholy look and with a deep sigh he sat down to attempt the translation of the poem in a few minutes however he rose and left the room declaring that he had the bad habit of not being able to do any thing in company lady geraldine now with much energy of indignation exclaimed against the pretensions of rich amateurs and the mean and presumptuous manner in which some wouldbe great people affect to patronise genius oh the baseness the emptiness of such patronising ostentation cried she i am accused of being proud myself but i hopei believei am sure that my pride is of another sort persons of any elevation or generosity of mind never have this species of pride but it is your mean secondrate folk who imagine that people of talent are a sort of rareeshow for their entertainment at best they consider men of genius only as artists formed for their use who if not in a situation to be paid with money are yet to be easily recompensed by praiseby their praisetheir praise heavens what conceit and these amateurpatrons really think themselves judges and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> and presume to advise and direct genius and employ it to their petty purposes like that pietro de medici who at some of his entertainments set michael angelo to make a statue of snow my lord did you ever happen to meet with les mmoires de madame de stal no i did not know that they were published you mistake me i mean madame de stal of louis the fourteenth and the regents time mademoiselle de launay i had never heard of such a person and i blushed for my ignorance nay i met with them myself only yesterday said lady geraldine i was struck with the character of the duchess de la fert in which this kind of proud patronising ignorance is admirably painted from the life it is really worth your while my lord to look at it theres the book on that little table here is the passage you see this duchess de la fert is showing off to a sisterduchess a poor girl of genius like a puppet or an ape allons mademoiselle parlezmadame vous allez voir comme elle parleelle vit que jhsitois rpondre et pensa quil falloit maider comme une chanteuse qui lon indique ce quon dsire dentendreparlez un peu de religion mademoiselle vous direz ensuite autre chose this speech mr devereux tells me has become quite proverbial in paris continued lady geraldine and it is often quoted when any one presumes in the duchess de la fertes style ignorance either in high or low life is equally selfsufficient i believe said i exerting myself to illustrate her ladyships remarks a gentleman of my acquaintance lately went to buy some razors at packwoods mrs packwood alone was visible upon the gentlemans complimenting her on the infinite variety of her husbands ingenious and poetical advertisements she replied la sir and do you think husband has time to write them there things hisself why sir we keeps a poet to do all that there work though lady geraldine spoke only in general of amateurpatrons and of men of genius yet i could not help fancying from the warmth with which she expressed herself and from her dwelling on the subject so long that her feelings were peculiarly interested for some individual of this description thus i discovered that lady geraldine had a heart and i suspected that her ladyship and mr devereux had also made the same discovery this suspicion was strengthened by a slight incident which occurred the following evening lady geraldine and cecil devereux as we were drinking coffee were in a recessed window while some of the company stood round them amused by their animated conversation they went on repartee after repartee as if inspired by each others spirits you two said a little girl of six years old who was playing in the window go on singing to one another like two nightingales and this shall be your cage added she drawing the drapery of the windowcurtains across the recessed window you shall live always together in this cage will you pretty birds no no some birds cannot live in a cage my dear cried lady geraldine playfully struggling to get free whilst the child held her prisoner mr devereux seems tolerably quiet and contented in his cage said the shrewd mrs oconnor i cant get out i cant get out cried devereux in the melancholy tone of the starling in the sentimental journey what is all this said my lady kildangan sailing up to us only two birds the child began singingbirds interrupted lady geraldine catching the little girl up in her arms and stopping her from saying more by beginning to sing most charmingly lady kildangan returned to the sofa without comprehending one word of what had passed for my part i now felt almost certain of the justice of my suspicions i was a little vexed but not by any means in that despair into which a man heartily in love would have been thrown by such a discovery well thought i it is well it is no worse it was very lucky that i did not fall quite in love with this fair lady since it seems that she has given her heart away but am i certain of this i was mistaken once let me examine more carefully now i had a new motive to keep my attention awake </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xi to preserve the continuity of my story and not to fatigue the reader with the journals of my comings and goings from ormsby villa to glenthorn castle and from glenthorn castle to ormsby villa i must here relate the observations i made and the incidents that occurred during various visits at sir harry </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> harry ormsbys in the course of the summer after the incident of the birds and cage my sagacity was for some time at fault i could not perceive any further signs of intelligence between the parties on the contrary all communication seemed abruptly to cease as i was not well versed in such affairs this quieted my suspicions and i began to think that i had been entirely mistaken cecil devereux spent his days shut up in his own apartment immersed as far as i could understand in the study of the persian language he talked to me of nothing but his hopes of an appointment which lord otoole had promised to procure for him in india when he was not studying he was botanizing or mineralogizing with otooles chaplain i did not envy him his new mode of life lady geraldine took no notice of it when they did meet which happened as seldom as possible there was an air of haughty displeasure on her part on his steady and apparently calm respect and selfsatisfaction her spirits were exuberant but variable and at times evidently forced his were not high but even and certain towards me her ladyships manners were free from coquetry yet politely gratifying as she marked by the sort of conversation she addressed to me her opinion that i was superior in ability and capability to what she had at first thought me and to what i had always thought myself mr devereux though with more effort treated me with distinction and showed a constant desire to cultivate my friendship on every occasion he endeavoured to raise my opinion of myself to give me ambition and courage to cultivate my mind once when i was arguing in favour of natural genius and saying that i thought no cultivation could make the abilities of one man equal to those of another he without seeming to perceive that i was apologizing at once for my own indolence and my intellectual inferiority answered in general terms it is difficult to judge what are the natural powers of the mind they appear so different in different circumstances you can no more judge of a mind in ignorance than of a plant in darkness a philosophical friend told me that he once thought he had discovered a new and strange plant growing in a mine it was common sage but so degenerated and altered that he could not know it he planted it in the open air and in the light and gradually it resumed its natural appearance and character mr devereux excited without fatiguing my mind by his conversation and i was not yet sufficiently in love to be seriously jealous i was resolved however to sound him upon the subject of lady geraldine i waited for a good opportunity at length as we were looking together over the prints of brgers lenore he led to the sort of conversation that i desired by telling me an anecdote relative to the poet which he had lately heard from a german baron burger was charmed with a sonnet which an unknown fair one addressed to him in praise of his poetry he replied in equal strains and they went on flattering one another till both believed themselves in love without ever having met they determined to marry they at length met and married they quarrelled and parted in other words the gentleman was terribly disappointed in his unknown mistress and she consoled herself by running away from him with another lover the imprudence of this poetic couple led us to reflections on love and marriage in general keeping far away from all allusion to lady geraldine i rallied mr devereux about the fair clementina who was evidently a romantic admirer of his who except cupid would barter his liberty for a butterfly said he and cupid was a child men nowadays are grown too wise to enslave themselves for women love occupies a vast space in a womans thoughts but fills a small portion in a mans life women are told that the great th important business of their life is love but men know that they are born for something better than to sing mournful ditties to a mistresss eyebrow as to marriage what a serious terrible thing some quaint old author says that man is of too smooth and oily a nature to climb up to heaven if to make him less slippery there be not added to his composition the vinegar of marriage this may be but i will keep as long as possible from the vinegar really devereux said i smiling you talk so like a cynic and an old bachelor and you </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> you look so little like either that it is quite ridiculous a man must be ridiculous sometimes said he and bear to be thought so no man ever distinguished himself who could not bear to be laughed at mr devereux left the room singing no more for amynta fresh garlands i wove ambition i said will soon cure me of love i was uncertain what to think of all this i inclined to believe that ambition was his ruling passion notwithstanding the description of that hell which he showed me in spenser his conduct to his patronlords by which a surer judgment of his character could be formed than by his professions was not however that of a man merely intent upon rising in the world i remember once hearing lord otoole attack a friend of this gentlemans calling him in a certain tone a philosopher mr devereux replied that he could not consider that as a term of reproach that where a false or pretended philosopher was meant some other name should be used equivalent to the italian term of reproach filosofastro lord otoole would by no means admit of this italianism he would make no distinctions he deemed philosophers altogether a race of beings dangerous and inimical to states for states read statesmen said devereux who persisted in the vindication of his friend till lord otoole grew pale with anger while captain andrews smiled with ineffable contempt at the political bvue lady geraldine glowed with generous indignation afterwards in speaking to me of lord otoole devereux said his lordships classification of men is as contracted as the savages classification of animals he divides mankind into two classes knaves and fools and when he meets with an honest man he does not know what to make of him my esteem for mr devereux was much increased by my daily observations upon his conduct towards lady geraldine i thought it particularly honourable when her displeasure evidently merged in esteem when her manners again became most winning and attractive his continued uniformly the same never passing the bounds of friendly respect or swerving in the slightest degree from the line of conduct which he had laid down for himself i thought i now understood him perfectly that he liked lady geraldine i could scarcely doubt but i saw that he refrained from aiming at the prize which he knew he ought not to obtain that he perceived her ladyships favourable disposition towards him yet denied himself not only the gratification of his vanity but the exquisite pleasure of conversing with her lest he should stand in the way of her happier prospects he frequently spoke to me of her ladyship in terms of the warmest approbation he said that all the world saw and admired her talents and beauty but that he had had opportunities as a relation of studying her domestic life with all her vivacity she has a heart formed for tenderness said he a high sense of duty the best security for a womans conduct and in generosity and magnanimity i never found her superior in either sex in short i never saw any woman whose temper and disposition were more likely to make a man of sense and feeling supremely happy i could not forbear smiling and asking cecil devereux how all this accorded with his late professions of hatred to marriage my professions were sincere said he it would be misery to me to marry any inferior woman and i am not in circumstances to marry as i could wish i could not think of lady geraldine without a breach of trust of which your lordship i hope cannot suspect me her mother places confidence in me i am not only a relation but treated as a friend of the family i am not in love with lady geraldine i admire esteem respect her ladyship and i wish to see her united to a man if such a man there be who may deserve her we understand one another now your lordship will have the goodness never more to speak to me on this subject he spoke with much emotion but with steadiness and left me penetrated with feelings that were entirely new to me much as i admired his conduct i was yet undecided as to my own my aversion to a second marriage was not yet conqueredi was amused i was captivated by lady geraldine but i could not bring myself to think of making a distinct proposal captain andrews himself was not more afraid of being committed than i was upon this tender subject to gain time i now thought it necessary to verify all the praises mr devereux </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> devereux had bestowed on her ladyship magnanimity was a word that particularly struck my ear as extraordinary when applied to a female however by attending carefully to this lady i thought i discovered what mr devereux meant lady geraldine was superior to manoeuvring little arts and petty stratagems to attract attention she would not stoop even to conquer from gentlemen she seemed to expect attention as her right as the right of her sex not to beg or accept of it as a favour if it were not paid she deemed the gentleman degraded not herself far from being mortified by any preference shown to other ladies her countenance betrayed only a sarcastic sort of pity for the bad taste of the men or an absolute indifference and look of haughty absence i saw that she beheld with disdain the paltry competitions of the young ladies her companions as her companions indeed she hardly seemed to consider them she tolerated their foibles forgave their envy and never exerted any superiority except to show her contempt of vice and meanness to be in any degree excepted from the common herd to be in any degree distinguished by a lady so proud and with so many good reasons to be proud was flattering to my selflove she gave me no direct encouragement but i never advanced far enough to require encouragement much less to justify repulse sometimes i observed or i fancied that she treated me with more favour when mr devereux was present than at other times perhapsfor she was a woman not an angelto pique devereux and try if she could move him from the settled purpose of his soul he bore it all with surprising constancy his spirits however and his health began visibly to decline if i do not intrude too much on your valuable time mr devereux said her ladyship to him one evening in her most attractive manner may i beg you to read to us some of these beautiful poems of sir william jones there was a seat beside her ladyship on the sofa the book was held out by the finest arm in the world nay said lady geraldine do not look so respectfully miserable if you have any other engagements you have only to say so or if you cannot speak you may bow a bow you know is an answer to every thing and here is my lord glenthorn ready to supply your place pray do not let me detain you prisoner you shall not a second time say i cant get out devereux made no further effort to escape but took the book and his dangerous seat he remained with us contrary to his custom the whole evening afterwards as if he felt that some apology was necessary to me for the pleasure in which he had indulged himself perhaps my lord said he another man in my situation and with my feelings would think it necessary to retreat and prudent to secure his safety by flight but flight is unworthy of him who can combat and conquer the man who is sure of himself does not skulk away to avoid danger but advances to meet it armed secure in honesty this proud and rash security in his own courage strength of mind and integrity was the only fault of cecil devereux he never prayed not to be led into temptation he thought himself so sure of avoiding evil unconscious of his danger even though his disease was at its height he now braved it most imprudently he was certain that he should never pass the bounds of friendship he had proved this to himself and was satisfied he told me that he could with indifference nay with pleasure see lady geraldine mine in the mean time upon the same principle that he deemed flight inglorious he was proud to expose himself to the full force of loves artillery he was with us now every day and almost all day and lady geraldine was more charming than ever the week was fixed for her departure still i could not decide i understood that her ladyship would pass the ensuing winter in dublin where she would probably meet with new adorers and even if mr devereux should not succeed some adventurous knight might win and wear the prize this was an alarming thought it almost decided me to hazard the fatal declaration but then i recollected that i might follow her ladyship to town the next winter and that if the impression did not as might be hoped wear off during the intervening autumn it would be time enough to commit myself when i should meet my fair </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> fair one in dublin this was at last my fixed resolution respited from the agonies of doubt i now waited very tranquilly for that moment to which most lovers look forward with horror the moment of separation i was sensible that i had accustomed myself to think about this lady so much that i had gradually identified my existence with hers and i thus found my spirit of animation much increased i dreaded the departure of lady geraldine less than the return of ennui in this frame of mind i was walking one morning in the pleasure grounds with lady geraldine when a slight accident made me act in direct contradiction to all my resolutions and i think inconsistently with my character but such is the nature of man and i was doomed to make a fool of myself even in the very temple of minerva among the various ornamental buildings in the grounds at ormsby villa there was a temple dedicated to this goddess from which issued a troop of hoyden young ladies headed by the widow oconnor and lady kilrush all calling to us to come and look at some charming discovery which they had just made in the temple of minerva thither we proceeded accompanied by the merry troop we found in the temple only a poetical inscription of lady kilrushs pompously engraved on a fine marble tablet we read the lines with all the attention usually paid to a ladys poetry in the presence of the poetess lady geraldine and i turned to pay some compliments on the performance when we found that lady kilrush and all her companions were gone gone all gone said lady geraldine and there they are making their way very fast down to the temple of folly lady kilrush you know is so baaashful she could not possibly stay to receive nos hommages i love to laugh at affectation call them back do my lord and you shall see the fair author go through all the evolutions of mock humility and end by yielding quietly to the notion that she is the tenth muse but run my lord or they will be out of our reach i never was seen to run on any occasion but to obey lady geraldine i walked as fast as i could to the door and to my surprise found it fastened locked i declare some of the witty tricks of the widow oconnor or the hoyden miss callwells how i hate hoydens cried lady geraldine but let us take patience they will be back presently if young ladies must perform practical jokes because quizzing is the fashion i wish they would devise something new this lockingup is so stale a jest to be sure it has lately to boast the authority of high rank in successful practice but these bungling imitators never distinguish between cases the most dissimilar imaginable silly creatures we have only to be wise and patient her ladyship sat down to reperuse the tablet i never saw her look so beautifulthe dignified composure of her manner charmed me it was so unlike the paltry affectation of some of the fashionable ladies by whom i had been disgusted i recollected the precedent to which she alluded i recollected that the lockingup ended in matrimony and as lady geraldine made some remarks upon the verses i suppose my answers showed my absence of mind why so grave my lord why so absent i assure you i do not suspect your lordship of having any hand in this vulgar manoeuvre i acquit you honourably therefore you need not stand any longer like a criminal what decided me at this instant i cannot positively tell whether it was the awkwardness of my own situation or the grace of her ladyships manner but all my prudential arrangements were forgotten all my doubts vanished before i knew that the words passed my lips i replied that her ladyship did me justice by such an acquittal but that though i had no part in the contrivance yet i felt irresistibly impelled to avail myself of the opportunity it afforded of declaring my real sentiments i was at her ladyships feet and making very serious love before i knew where i was in what words my longdelayed declaration was made i cannot recollect but i well remember lady geraldines answer my lord i assure you that you do not know what you are saying you do not know what you are doing this is all a mistake as you will find half an hour hence i will not be so cruelly vain as to suppose you serious not serious no man ever was more serious no </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> no nono no no i swore of course most fervently oh rise rise i beseech you my lord and dont look so like a hero though you have done an heroical action i grant how you ever brought yourself to it i cannot imagine but now for your comfort you are safevous voil quitte pour la peur do not however let this encourage you to venture again in the same foolish manner i know but few very few young ladies to whom lord glenthorn could offer himself with any chance or reasonable hope of being refused so take warning never again expect to meet with such another as my whimsical self never never can i expect to meet with any thing resembling your charming self cried i this was a new text for a lovers rhapsody it is not necessary and might not be generally interesting to repeat all the ridiculous things i said even if i could remember them lady geraldine listened to me and then very calmly replied granting you believe all that you are saying at this minute which i must grant from common gratitude and still more common vanity nevertheless permit me to assure you my lord that this is not love it is only a fancyonly the nettlerash not the plague you will not die this time i will insure your life so now jump out of the window as fast as you can and unlock the dooryou need not be afraid of breaking your neckyou know your life is insured come take the lovers leap and get rid of your passion at once i grew angry only a cloud said lady geraldineit will blow over i became more passionatei did not know the force of my own feelings till they met with an obstacle they suddenly rose to a surprising height now my lord cried lady geraldine with a tone and look of comic vexation this is really the most provoking thing imaginable you have no idea how you distress me nor of what exquisite pleasures you deprive meall the pleasures of coquetry legitimate pleasures in certain circumstances as i am instructed to think them by one of the first moral authorities there is a casei quote from memory my lord for my memory like that of most other people on subjects where i am deeply interested is tolerably tenaciousthere is a case says the best of fathers in his legacy to the best of daughtersthere is a case where a woman may coquet justifiably to the utmost verge which her conscience will allow it is where a gentleman purposely declines making his addresses till such time as he thinks himself perfectly sure of her consent now my lord if you had had the goodness to do so i might have made this delightful case my own and what charming latitude i might have allowed my conscience but now alas it is all over and i must be as frank as you have been under pain of forfeiting what i value more even than admirationmy own good opinion she paused and was silent for a few moments then suddenly changing her manner she exclaimed in a serious energetic tone yes i must i will be sincere let it cost me what it may i will be sincere my lord i never can be yours my lord you will believe me even from the effort with which i speak her voice softened and her face suffused with crimson as she spoke i love anothermy heart is no longer in my own possession whether it will ever be in my power consistently with my duty and his principles to be united with the man of my choice is doubtfulmore than doubtfulbut this is certain that with such a prepossession such a conviction in my mind i never could nor ought to think of marrying any other person i pleaded that however deserving of her preference the object of her favour might be yet that if there were as her own prudence seemed to suggest obstacles rendering the probability of her union with that person more than doubtful it might be possible that her superior sense and strength of mind joined to the persevering affection of another lover who would spare no exertions to render himself worthy of her might perhaps in time no no said she interrupting me do not deceive yourself i will not deceive you i give you no hopes that my sentiments may change i know my own mindit will not change my attachment is founded on the firm basis of esteem my affection has grown from the intimate knowledge of the principles and conduct of the man i </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> i love no other man let his merits be what they may could have these advantages in my opinion and when i say that the probability of our being united is more than doubtful i do not mean to deny that i have distant hope that change of circumstances might render love and duty compatible without hope i know love cannot long exist you see i do not talk romantic nonsense to you all that you say of prudence and time and the effect of the attentions of another admirer would be perfectly just and applicable if my attachment were a fancy of yesterdayif it were a mere young ladys commonplace first love but i am not a very young lady nor is this though a first love commonplace i do not you see in the usual style tell you that the man i adore is an angel and that no created form ever did or ever can resemble this angel in green and gold but on the contrary do justice to your lordships merit and believing as i do that you are capable of a real love still more believing that such an attachment would rouse you to exertion and bring to life and light a surprising number of good qualities yet i should deceive you unpardonably fatally for my own peace of mind if not for yours were i not frankly and decidedly to assure you that i never could reward or return your affection my attachment toi trust entirely where i trust at allmy attachment to mr devereux is for life he deserves itdeserves it all cried i struggling for utterance that is as much as a rival can say not more than i expected from you my lord but your ladyship says there is a hope of duty and love being compatible would lady kildangan ever consent she looked much disturbed no certainly not unlesslord otoole has promisednot that i depend on courtiers promisesbut lord otoole is a relation of ours and he has promised to obtain an appointment abroad in india for mr devereux if that were done he might appear of more consequence in the eyes of the world my mother might then perhaps be propitious my lord i give you the strongest proof of my esteem by speaking with such openness i have had the honour of your lordships acquaintance only a few months but without complimenting my own penetration i may securely trust to the judgment of mr devereux and his example has taught me to feel confidence in your lordship your conduct now will i trust justify my good opinion by your secrecy and by desisting from useless pursuit you will entitle yourself to my esteem and gratitude these i presume you will think worth securing my soul was so completely touched that i could not articulate mr devereux is righti see my lord that you have a soul that can be touched kissing hands i protest exclaimed a shrill voice at the window we turned and saw mrs oconnor and a group of tittering faces peeping in kissing hands after a good hours ttette oh pray lady kildangan make haste here continued mrs oconnor make haste before lady geraldines blushes are over were you ever detected in the crime of blushing in your life mrs oconnor said i i never was found out locked up with so fine a gentleman replied mrs oconnor then it hurts your conscience only to be found out like all the rest of the vast family of the surfaces said lady geraldine resuming her spirit found outlocked upbless me bless me what is all this cried lady kildangan puffing up the hill for shame young ladies for shame continued her ladyship with a decent suppression of her satisfaction when she saw or thought she saw how matters stood unlock the door pray dont be vexed my geraldine fie fie mrs oconnor but quizzing is now so fashionablenobody can be angry with any body my geraldine consider we are all friends the door unlocked and as we were going out lady geraldine whispered to mefor mercys sake my lord dont break my poor mothers heart never let her know that a coronet has been within my grasp and that i have not clutched it lady kildangan who thought that all was now approaching that happy termination she so devoutly wished was so full of her own happy presentiments that it was impossible for me to undeceive her ladyship even when i announced before her to sir harry ormsby that i was obliged to return home immediately on particular business she was i am sure persuaded that i was going to prepare matters </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> matters for marriagesettlements when i mounted my horse mr devereux pressed through a crowd assembled on the steps at the halldoor and offered me his hand with a look and manner that seemed to sayhave you sufficient generosity to be still my friend i know the value of your friendship mr devereux said i and i hope to deserve it better every year that i live for the effort which it cost me to say this i was rewarded lady geraldine who had retired behind her companions at this instant approached with an air of mingled grace and dignity bowed her head and gave me a smile of grateful approbation this is the last image left on my mind the last look of the charming geraldinei never saw her again after i got home i did not shave for two days and scarcely ever spoke i should have taken to my bed to avoid seeing any human creature but i knew that if i declared myself ill no power would keep my old nurse ellinor from coming to moan over me and i was not in a humour to listen to stories of the irish black beard or the ghost of king odonoghoe nor could i however troublesome have repulsed the simplicity of her affection instead of going to bed therefore i continued to lie stretched upon a sofa ruminating sweet and bitter thoughts after giving absolute orders that i should not be disturbed on any account whatever whilst i was in this state of reverie one of my servantsan odd irish fellow who under pretence of being halfwitted took more liberties than his companionsbolted into my presence plase your lordship i thought it my duty in spite of em all below to come up to advertise to your lordship of the news thats going through the country that they are all upside down at ormsby villa all mad entirelyfighting and setting off through the kingdom every one their own way and they say its all on account of something that miss clemmy ormsby told that lady geraldine said about my lord otooles being no better than a cats paw or something that way which made his lordship quite mad and he said in the presence of captain andrews and my lady kildangan and lady geraldine and all that were in it something that vexed lady geraldine which made mr cecil devereux mad next and he said something smart in reply that lord otoole could not digest he said which made his lordship madder than ever and he discharged mr devereux from his favour and he is not to get that place that was vacant the lordlieutenancy of some place in the indies that he was to have had this made lady geraldine mad and it was found out she was in love with mr devereux which made her mother mad the maddest of all they say so that none can hold her and she is crying night and day how her daughter might have had the first coronet in the kingdom maning you my lard if it had not been that she prefarred a beggarman maning mr cecil devereux who is as poor they say as a connaughtmanand hes forbid to think of her and shes forbid under pain of bread and water ever to set her eyes upon him the longest day ever she lives so the horses and coaches are ordered and they are all to be off with the first light for dublin and thats all my lard and all truth not a word of lies im telling i was inclined not to credit a story so oddly told but upon inquiry i found it true in its material points my own words to mr devereux and the parting look of lady geraldine were full in my recollection i was determined by an unexpected exertion to surprise both the lovers and to secure for ever their esteem and gratitude the appointment which mr devereux desired was not yet given away the fleet was to sail in a few days i started up from my sofaordered my carriage instantlyshaved myselfsent a courier on before to have horses ready at every stage to carry me to dublingot there in the shortest time possiblefound lord otoole but just arrived though unused to diplomatic language and political negotiation i knew pretty well on what they all hinge i went directly to the point and showed that it would be the interest of the party concerned to grant my request by expressing a becoming desire that my boroughs upon a question where a majority was required should strengthen the hands of government i obtained for my friend </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> friend the favour he deserved before i quitted lord otoole his secretary captain andrews was instructed to write a letter announcing to mr devereux his appointment a copy of the former letter of refusal now lay before me it was in his lordships purest diplomatic styleas follows private lord otoole is concerned to inform mr devereux that he cannot feel himself justified in encouraging mr d under the existing circumstances to make any direct application relative to the last conversation his lordship had the honour to hold with mr devereux to cecil devereux esq c thursday the letter which i obtained and of which i took possession ran as follows private lord otoole is happy to have it in command to inform mr devereux that his lordships representations on the subject of their last conversation have been thought sufficient and that an official notification of the appointment to india which mr d desired will meet the wishes of mr devereux captain andrews has the honour to add his congratulations to cecil devereux esq c thursday having despatched this business with a celerity that surprised all the parties concerned and most myself i called at the lodgings of mr devereux delivered the letter to his servant and left town i could not bear to see either mr devereux or lady geraldine i had the pleasure to hear that the obtaining this appointment was followed by lady kildangans consent to their marriage soon after my return to glenthorn castle i received a letter of warm thanks from devereux and a polite postscript from lady geraldine declaring that though she felt much pleasure she could feel no surprise in seeing her opinion of lord glenthorn justified persuaded as she and mr devereux had always been that only motive and opportunity were wanting to make his lordships superior qualities known to the world and what was still more difficult to himself they left ireland immediately afterwards in consequence of their appointment in india i was raised in my own estimationi revelled a short time in my selfcomplacent reflections but when nothing more remained to be done or to be saidwhen the hurry of action the novelty of generosity the glow of enthusiasm and the freshness of gratitude were over i felt that though large motives could now invigorate my mind i was still a prey to habitual indolence and that i should relapse into my former state of apathy and disease </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xii i remember to have heard in some epilogue to a tragedy that the tide of pity and of love whilst it overwhelms fertilizes the soul that it may deposit the seeds of future fertilization i believe but some time must elapse before they germinate on the first retiring of the tide the prospect is barren and desolate i was absolutely inert and almost imbecile for a considerable time after the extraordinary stimulus by which i had been actuated was withdrawn i was in this state of apathy when the rebellion broke out in ireland nor was i roused in the least by the first news of the disturbances the intelligence however so much alarmed my english servants that with one accord they left me nothing could persuade them to remain longer in ireland the parting with my english gentleman affected my lethargic selfishness a little his loss would have been grievous to such a helpless being as i was had not his place been immediately supplied by that halfwitted irishman joe kelly who had ingratiated himself with me by a mixture of drollery and simplicity and by suffering himself to be continually my laughingstock for in imitation of lady geraldine i thought it necessary to have a butt i remember he first caught my notice by a strange answer to a very simple question i asked what noise is that i hear my lard said he it is only the singing in my ears i have had it these six months another time when i reproached him for having told me a lie he answered why now indeed and plase your honour my lard i tell as few lies as possibly i can this fellow the son of a bricklayer had originally been intended for a priest and he went as he told me to the college of maynooth to study his humanities but unluckily the charms of some irish heloise came between him and the altar he lived in a cabin of love till he was weary of his smokedried heloise and then thought it convanient to turn sarving man as he could play on the flute and brush a coat remarkably well which he larned at maynooth by brushing the coats of the superiors though </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> though he was willing to be laughed at joe kelly could in his turn laugh and he now ridiculed without mercy the pusillanimity of the english renegadoes as he called the servants who had just left my service he assured me that to his knowledge there was no manner of danger excepted a man prefarred being afraid of his own shadow which some did rather than have nothing to talk of or enter into resolutions about with some of the spirited men in the chair unwilling to be disturbed i readily believed all that lulled me in my security i would not be at the trouble of reading the public papers and when they were read to me i did not credit any paragraph that militated against my own opinion nothing could awaken me i remember one day lying yawning on my sofa repeating to mr mleod who endeavoured to open my eyes to the situation of the country pshaw my dear sir there is no danger be assurednone at allnone at all for mercys sake talk to me of something more diverting if you would keep me awake time enough to think of these things when they come nearer to us evils that were not immediately near me had no power to affect my imagination my tenantry had not yet been contaminated by the epidemic infection which broke out soon after with such violence as to threaten the total destruction of all civil order i had lived in englandi was unacquainted with the causes and the progress of the disease and i had no notion of my danger all i knew was that some houses had been robbed of arms and that there was a set of desperate wretches called defenders but i was annoyed only by the rout that was now made about them having been used to the regular course of justice which prevailed in england i was more shocked at the summary proceedings of my neighbours than alarmed at the symptoms of insurrection whilst my mind was in this mood i was provoked by the conduct of some of the violent party which wounded my personal pride and infringed upon my imagined consequence my fosterbrothers forge was searched for pikes his house ransacked his bed and bellows as possible hiding places were cut open by accident or from private malice he received a shot in his arm and though not the slightest cause of suspicion could be found against him the party left him with a broken arm and the consolation of not being sent to jail as a defender without making any allowance for the peculiar circumstances of the country my indignation was excited in the extreme by the injury done to my fosterbrother his sufferings the tears of his mother the taunts of mr now captain hardcastle and the opposition made by his party called forth all the faculties of my mind and body the poor fellow who was the subject of this contest showed the best disposition imaginable he was excessively grateful to me for interesting myself to get him justice but as soon as he found that parties ran high against me he earnestly dissuaded me from persisting let it drop and plase your honour my lord let it drop and dont be making of yourself inimies for the likes of me sure what signifies my arm and before the next assizes shant i be as well as ever arm and all continued he trying to appear to move the arm without pain and theres the new bellows your honour has give me it does my heart good to look at em and it wont be long before i will be blowing them again as stout as ever and so god bless your honour my lord and think no more about itlet it drop entirely and dont be bringing yourself into trouble ay dont be bringing yourself into trouble dear added ellinor who seemed half distracted between her feelings for her son and her fears for me its a shame to think of the way theyve treated christybut theres no help now and its best not to be making bad worse and so as christy says let the thing drop jewel and dont be bringing yourself into trouble you dont know the natur of them people dearyou are too innocent for them entirely and myself does not know the mischief they might do yees true for ye pursued christy i wouldnt for the best cow ever i see that your honour ever larnt a sentence about me or my arm and it is not for such as we to be minding every little accidentso god lend you long </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> long life and dont be plaguing yourself to death let it drop and ill sleep well the night which i did not do the week for thinking of all the trouble you got and would get god presarve ye this generous fellows eloquence produced an effect directly contrary to what was intended both my feelings and my pride were now more warmly interested in his cause i insisted upon his swearing examinations before mr mleod who was a justice of the peace mr mleod behaved with the utmost steadiness and impartiality and in this trying moment when it was infamy to seem my friend he defended my conduct calmly but resolutely in private and in public and gave his unequivocal testimony in few but decided words in favour of my injured tenant i should have respected mr mleod more if i had not attributed this conduct to his desire of being returned for one of my boroughs at the approaching election he endeavoured with persevering goodness to convince me of the reality of the danger in the country my eyes were with much difficulty forced open so far as to perceive that it was necessary to take an active part in public affairs to vindicate my loyalty and to do away the prejudices that were entertained against me nor did my incredulity as to the magnitude of the peril prevent me from making exertions essential to the defence of my own character if not to that of the nation how few act from purely patriotic and rational motives at all events i acted and acted with energy and certainly at this period of my life i felt no ennui party spirit is an effectual cure for ennui and perhaps it is for this reason that so many are addicted to its intemperance all my passions were roused and my mind and body kept in continual activity i was either galloping or haranguing or fearing or hoping or fighting and so long as it was said that i could not sleep in my bed i slept remarkably well and never had so good an appetite as when i was in hourly danger of having nothing to eat the rebels were up and the rebels were downand lord glenthorns spirited conduct in the chair and indefatigable exertions in the field were the theme of daily eulogium amongst my convivial companions and immediate dependants but unfortunately my sudden activity gained me no credit amongst the violent party of my neighbours who persisted in their suspicions and my reputation was now still more injured by the alternate charge of being a trimmer or a traitor nay i was further exposed to another danger of which from my ignorance of the country i could not possibly be aware the disaffected themselves as i afterwards found really believed that as i had not begun by persecuting the poor i must be a favourer of the rebels and all that i did to bring the guilty to justice they thought was only to give a colour to the thing till the proper moment should come for my declaring myself of this absurd and perverse mode of judging i had not the slightest conception and i only laughed when it was hinted to me my treating the matter so lightly confirmed suspicion on both sides at this time all objects were so magnified and distorted by the mist of prejudice that no inexperienced eye could judge of their real proportions neither party could believe the simple truth that my tardiness to act arose from the habitual inertia of my mind and body whilst prepossessions were thus strong the time the important time in ireland the most important season of the year the assizes arrived my fosterbrothers cause or as it was now generally called lord glenthorns cause came on to be tried i spared no expense i spared no exertions i feed the ablest counsel and not content with leaving them to be instructed by my attorney i explained the affair to them myself with indefatigable zeal one of the lawyers whom i had seen or by whom i had been seen in my former inert state of existence at some wateringplace in england could not refrain from expressing his astonishment at my change of character he could scarcely believe that i was the same lord glenthorn of whose indolence and ennui he had formerly heard and seen so much alas all my activity all my energy on the present occasion proved ineffectual after a dreadful quantity of false swearing the jury professed themselves satisfied and without retiring from the box acquitted the persons who had assaulted my fosterbrother the mortification of this legal </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> legal defeat was not all that i had to endure the victorious party mobbed me as i passed some time afterwards through a neighbouring town where captain hardcastle and his friends had been carousing i was hooted and pelted and narrowly escaped with my lifei who but a few months ago had imagined myself possessed of nearly despotic power but opinions had changed and on opinion almost all power is founded no individual unless he possess uncommon eloquence joined to personal intrepidity can withstand the combination of numbers and the force of prejudice such was the result of my first public exertions yet i was now happier and better satisfied with myself than i had ever been before i was not only conscious of having acted in a manly and generous manner but the alarms of the rebels and of the french and of the loyalists and the parading and the galloping and the quarrelling and the continual agitation in which i was kept whilst my character and life were at stake relieved me effectually from the intolerable burden of ennui </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiii and for the book of knowledge fair presented with an universal blank of natures works to me expunged and rased unfortunately for me the rebellion in ireland was soon quelled the nightly scouring of our county ceased the poor people returned to their duty and their homes the occupation of upstart and ignorant associators ceased and their consequence sunk at once things and persons settled to their natural level the influence of men of property and birth and education and character once more prevailed the spirit of party ceased to operate my neighbours wakened as if from a dream and wondered at the strange injustice with which i had been treated those who had lately been my combined enemies were disunited and each was eager to assure me that he had always been privately my friend but that he was compelled to conceal his sentiments each exculpated himself and threw the blame on others all apologized to me and professed to be my most devoted humble servants my popularity my power and my prosperity were now at their zenith unfortunately for me because my adversity had not lasted long enough to form and season my character i had been driven to exertion by a mixture of pride and generosity my understanding being uncultivated i had acted from the virtuous impulse of the moment but never from rational motive which alone can be permanent in its operation when the spur of the occasion pressed upon me no longer i relapsed into my former inactivity when the great interests and strong passions by which i had been impelled to exertion subsided all other feelings and all less objects seemed stale flat and unprofitable for the tranquillity which i was now left to enjoy i had no taste it appeared to me a dead calm most spiritless and melancholy i remember hearing some years afterwards a frenchman who had been in imminent danger of been guillotined by robespierre and who at last was one of those who arrested the tyrant declare that when the bustle and horror of the revolution were over he could hardly keep himself awake and that he thought it very insipid to live in quiet with his wife and family he further summed up the catalogue of robespierres crimes by exclaiming dailleurs ctoit un grand philanthrope i am not conscious of any disposition to cruelty and i heard this mans speech with disgust yet upon a candid selfexamination i must confess that i have felt though from different causes some degree of what he described perhaps ennui may have had a share in creating revolutions a french author pronounces ennui to be a moral indigestion caused by a monotony of situations i had no wife or family to make domestic life agreeable nor was i inclined to a second marriage my first had proved so unfortunate and the recollection of my disappointment with lady geraldine was so recent even the love of power no longer acted upon me my power was now undisputed my jealousy and suspicions of my agent mr mleod were about this time completely conquered by his behaviour at a general election i perceived that he had no underhand design upon my boroughs and that he never attempted or wished to interfere in my affairs except at my particular desire my confidence in him became absolute and unbounded but this was really a misfortune to me for it became the cause of my having still less to do i gave up all business and from all manner of trouble i was now free yet i became more and more </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> more unhappy and my nervous complaints returned i was not aware that i was taking the very means to increase my own disease the philosophical dr cullen observes that whatever aversion to application of any kind may appear in hypochondriacs there is nothing more pernicious to them than absolute idleness or a vacancy from all earnest pursuit it is owing to wealth admitting of indolence and leading to the pursuit of transitory and unsatisfying amusements or exhausting pleasures only that the present times exhibit to us so many instances of hypochondriacism i fancied that change of air and change of place would do me good and as it was fine summer weather i projected various parties of pleasure the giants causeway and the lake of killarney were the only things i had ever heard mentioned as worth seeing in ireland i suffered myself to be carried into the county of antrim and i saw the giants causeway from the description given by dr hamilton of some of these wonders of nature the reader may judge how much i ought to have been astonished and delighted in the bold promontory of bengore you behold as you look up from the sea a gigantic colonnade of basaltes supporting a black mass of irregular rock over which rises another range of pillars forming altogether a perpendicular height of one hundred and seventy feet from the base of which the promontory covered over with rock and grass slopes down to the sea for the space of two hundred feet more making in all a mass of near four hundred feet in height which in the beauty and variety of its colouring in elegance and novelty of arrangement and in the extraordinary magnificence of its objects cannot be rivalled yet i was seized with a fit of yawning as i sat in my pleasureboat to admire this sublime spectacle i looked at my watch observed that we should be late for dinner and grew impatient to be rowed back to the place where we were to dine not that i was hungry but i wanted to be again set in motion neither science nor taste expanded my view and i saw nothing worthy of my admiration or capable of giving me pleasure the watching a straw floating down the tide was the only amusement i recollect to have enjoyed upon this excursion i was assured however by lady ormsby that i could not help being enchanted with the lake of killarney the party was arranged by this lady who having the preceding summer seen me captivated by lady geraldine and pitying my disappointment had formed the obliging design of restoring my spirits and marrying me to one of her near relatives she calculated that as i had been charmed by lady geraldines vivacity i must be enchanted with the fine spirits of lady jocunda lawler so far were the thoughts of marriage from my imagination that i only was sorry to find a young lady smuggled into our party because i was afraid she would be troublesome but i resolved to be quite passive upon all occasions where attentions to the fair sex are sometimes expected my arm or my hand or my assistance in any manner i was determined not to offer the lounging indifference which some fashionable young men affect towards ladies i really felt and besides nobody minds unmarried women this fashion was most convenient to my indolence in my state of torpor i was not however long left in peace lady jocunda was a highbred romp who made it a rule to say and do whatever she pleased in a hundred indirect ways i was called upon to admire her charming spirits but the rattling voice loud laughter flippant wit and hoyden gaiety of lady jocunda disgusted me beyond expression a thousand times on my journey i wished myself quietly asleep in my own castle arrived at killarney such blowing of horns such boating such seeing of prospects such prosing of guides all telling us what to admire then such exclamations and such clambering i was walked and talked till i was halfdead i wished the rocks and the hangingwoods and the glens and the waterfalls and the arbutus and the myrtles and the upper and lower lakes and the islands and mucruss and mucruss abbey and the purple mountain and the eagles nest and the grand turk and the lights and the shades and the echoes and above all the lady jocunda fairly at the devil a nobleman in the neighbourhood had the politeness to invite us to see a staghunt upon the water the account of this diversion which i had met with in my </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> my guide to the lakes83 promised well i consented to stay another day that day i really was revived by this spectacle for it was new the sublime and the beautiful had no charms for me novelty was the only power that could waken me from my lethargy perhaps there was in this spectacle something more than novelty the romans had recourse to shows of wild beasts and gladiators to relieve their ennui at all events i was kept awake this whole morning though i cannot say that i felt in such ecstasies as to be in any imminent danger of jumping out of the boat of our journey back from killarney i remember nothing but my being discomfited by lady jocundas practical jests and overpowering gaiety when she addressed herself to me my answers were as constrained and as concise as possible and as i was afterwards told i seemed at the close of my reply to each interrogative of her ladyships to answer with odins prophetess now my weary lips i close leave me leave me to repose this she never did till we parted and at that moment i believe my satisfaction appeared so visible that lady ormsby gave up all hopes of me arrived at my own castle i threw myself on my bed quite exhausted i took three hours additional sleep every day for a week to recruit my strength and rest my nerves after all that i had been made to suffer by this young ladys prodigious animal spirits </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiv i could now boast that i had travelled all over ireland from north to south but in fact i had seen nothing of the country or of its inhabitants in these commodious parties of pleasure every thing had been provided to prevent the obstacles that roused my faculties accustomed by this time to the hibernian tone i fancied that i knew all that could be known of the irish character familiarized with the comic expressions of the lower class of people they amused me no longer on this journey however i recollect making one observation and once laughing at what i thought a practical bull we saw a number of labourers at work in a bog on a very hot day with a fire lighted close to them when i afterwards mentioned before mr mleod this circumstance which i had thought absurd he informed me that the irish labourers often light fires that the smoke may drive away or destroy those myriads of tiny flies called midges by which they are often tormented so much that without this remedy they would in hot and damp weather be obliged to abandon their work had i been sufficiently active during my journey to pen a journal i should certainly without further inquiry have noted down that the irish labourers always light fires in the hottest weather to cool themselves and thus i should have added one more to the number of cursory travellers who expose their own ignorance whilst they attempt to ridicule local customs of which they have not inquired the cause or discovered the utility a foreigner who has lately written letters on england has given a laughable instance of this promptitude of misapprehension he says he had heard much of the venality of the british parliament but he had no idea of the degree to which it extended till he actually was an eyewitness of the scene the moment the minister entered the house all the members ran about exclaiming places places which means give us placesgive us places my heavy indolence fortunately preserved me from exposing myself like these volatile tourists i was at least secure from the danger of making mistakes in telling what i never saw as to the mode of living of the irish their domestic comforts or grievances their habits and opinions their increasing or decreasing ambition to better their condition the proportion between the population and the quantity of land cultivated or capable of cultivation the difference between the profits of the husbandman and the artificer the relation between the nominal wages of labour and the actual command over the necessaries of lifethese were questions wholly foreign to my thoughts and at this period of my life absolutely beyond the range of my understanding i had travelled through my own country without making even a single remark upon the various degrees of industry and civilization visible in different parts of the kingdom in fact it never occurred to me that it became a british nobleman to have some notion of the general state of that empire in the legislation of which he has a share nor had i the slightest suspicion that </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> that political economy was a study requisite or suitable to my rank in life or situation in society satisfied with having seen all that is worth seeing in ireland the giants causeway and the lake of killarney i was now impatient to return to england during the rebellion i could not with honour desert my post but now that tranquillity was apparently restored i determined to quit a country of which my partial knowledge had in every respect been unfortunate this resolution of mine to leave ireland threw ellinor into despair and she used all her eloquence to dissuade me from the journey i was quite surprised by the agony of grief into which she was thrown by the dread of my departure i felt astonished that one human being could be so attached to another and i really envied her sensibility my new man joe kelly also displayed much reluctance at the thoughts of leaving his native country and this sentiment inclined ellinor to think more favourably of him though she could not quite forgive him for being a kelly of ballymuddy troth said she to him one day in my presence none of them kellys of ballymuddy but what are a bad clan joey is not there your own broders uncle lying in the jail of at this present time for the murder of a womanwell replied joe and if he was so unfortunate to be put up which was not asy done neither is it not better and more creditabler to lie in a jail for a murder than a robbery i ask you this new scale of crimes surprised me but joe spoke what was the sense of many of his countrymen at that period by various petty attentions this man contrived to persuade me of the sincerity of his attachment chiefly by the art of appearing to be managed by me in all things he insensibly obtained power over my pride and by saving me daily trouble secured considerable influence over my indolence more than any one whom i had ever seen he had the knack of seeming halfwittedtoo simple to overreach and yet sufficiently acute and droll to divert his master i liked to have him about me as uncultivated kings like to have their fools one of our ancient monarchs is said to have given three parishes to his joculator i gave only three farms to mine i had a sort of mean pride in making my favourite an object of envy besides i fell into the common mistake of the inexperienced great who fancy that attachment can be purchased and that gratitude can be secured by favours disproportioned to deserts joe kelly by sundry manoeuvres too minute for description contrived to make me delay from day to day the preparations for my journey to england from week to week it was put off till the autumn was far advanced at length kelly had nothing left to suggest but that it would be best to wait for answers from my english steward to the letters that had been written to inquire whether every thing was ready for my reception during this interval i avoided every human creature except joe kelly and was in great danger of becoming a misanthrope from mere indolence i did not hate my fellowcreatures but i dreaded the trouble of talking to them my only recreation at this period was sauntering out in the evening beside the seashore it was my regular practice to sit down upon a certain large stone at the foot of a rock to watch the ebbing of the tide there was something in the contemplation of the sea and of the tides which was fascinating to my mind i could sit and look at the ocean whole hours together for without any exertion of my own i beheld a grand operation of nature accompanied with a sort of vast monotony of motion and sound which lulled me into reverie late one evening as i was seated on my accustomed stone my attention was slightly diverted from the sea by the sight of a man descending the crag above me in rather a perilous manner with one end of a rope coiled round his body and the other fastened to a stake driven into the summit of the rock he let himself halfway down the terrible height one foot now rested on a projecting point one hand held the rope and hanging thus midway in the air he seemed busy searching in the crevices of the rock for the eggs of waterfowl this dangerous trade i had seen frequently plied on this coast so that i should scarcely have regarded the </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense3> the man if he had not turned from time to time as if to watch me when he saw that he had fixed my eye he threw down as i thought a white stone which fell nearly at my feet i stooped to examine it the man waited till he saw it in my hands then coiled himself swiftly up his rope to the summit of the rock and disappeared i found a paper tied round the stone and on this paper in a handwriting that seemed to be feigned were written these words your life and caracter one or tothersay both is in danger dont be walking here any more late in the evening near them caves nor dont go near the old abbey any timeand dont be trusting to joe kelly any waylave the kingdom entirely the wind sarves so prays your true wellwisher ps lave the castle the morrow and say nothing of this to joe kelly or youll repent when its all over wid you i was startled a little by this letter at first but in half an hour i relapsed into my apathy many gentlemen in the country had received anonymous letters i had been tired of hearing of them during the rebellion this i thought might be only a quiz or a trick to hurry me out of the kingdom contrived by some of those who desired my absence in short the labour of thinking about the matter fatigued me i burned the letter as soon as i got home and resolved not to puzzle or plague myself about it any more my stewards answer came the next morning from england kelly made no difficulty when i ordered him to be ready to set out in three days this confirmed me in my opinion that the letter was malicious or a jest mr mleod came to take leave of me i mentioned the circumstance to him slightly and in general terms he looked very serious and said all these things are little in themselves but are to be heeded as marking the unsettled minds of the peoplestraws that show which way the wind blows i apprehend we shall have a rough winter again though we have had so still a summer the people about us are too hush and too prudentit is not their naturestheres something contriving among them they dont break one anothers heads at fairs as they used to do they keep from whiskey there must be some strong motive working this change upon themgood or bad tis hard to say which my lord if we consider the condition of these poor people and if we consider the causes oh for heavens sake do not let us consider any more about it now i am more than half asleep already said i yawning and our considering about it can do no good to me at least for you know i am going out of the kingdom and when i am gone mleod you in whom i have implicit confidence must manage as you always used to do you know and as well as you can true said mleod calmly that is what i shall do indubitably for that is my duty and since your lordship has implicit confidence in me my pleasure i wish your lordship a good night and a good journey i shall not set out in the morning not till the day after tomorrow i believe said i for i feel consumedly tired tonight they have plagued me about so many things today so much business always before one can get away from a place and then joe kelly has no head have a care he has not too much head my lord as your anonymous correspondent hintshe may be right there i told you from the first i would not go security for joe kellys honesty and where there is not strict honesty i conceive there ought not to be implicit confidence oh hang it as to honesty they are none of them honest i know that but would you have me plague myself till i find a strictly honest servant joes as honest as his neighbours i dare say the fellow diverts me and is attached to me and thats all i can expect i must submit to be cheated as all men of large fortunes are more or less mr mleod listened with stubborn patience and replied that if i thought it necessary to submit to be cheated he could make no objection except where it might come under his cognizance and then he must take the liberty to remonstrate or to give up his agency to some of the many </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> many who could play better than he could the part of the dog in the fable pretending to guard his masters meat the cold ungracious integrity of this man even in my own cause at once excited my spleen and commanded my respect after shaking my leg as i sat for two minutes in silence i called after mleod who moved towards the door why what can i do mr mleod what would you have me do now dont give me one of your dry answers but let me have your notions as a friend you know mleod i cannot help having the most perfect confidence in you he bowed but rather stiffly i am proud to hear you cannot help that my lord said he as to a friend i never considered myself upon that footing till now but as you at present honour me so far as to ask my counsel i am free to give it part with joe kelly tonight and whether you go or stay you are safer without him joes a rogue he can do no good and may do harm then said i you are really frightened by this anonymous letter cannot a man take prudent precautions without being frightened said mleod but have you any particular reason to believein short toto think there can be any real danger for my life no particular reason my lord but the general reasons i have mentioned the symptoms among the common people lead me to apprehend there may be fresh risings of the people soon and you as a man of fortune and rank must be in danger captain hardcastle says that he has had informations of seditious meetings but he being a prejudiced man i dont trust altogether to what he says trust altogether to what he says exclaimed i no surely for my part i do not trust a word he says and his giving it as his opinion that the people are illinclined would decide me to believe the exact contrary it would hardly be safe to judge that way either said mleod for that method of judging by contraries might make anothers folly the master of ones own sense i dont comprehend you now safe way of judging or not captain hardcastles opinion shall never lead mine when i asked for your advice mr mleod it was because i have a respect for your understanding but i cannot defer to captain hardcastles i am now decided in my own opinion that the people in this neighbourhood are perfectly welldisposed and as to this anonymous letter it is a mere trick depend upon it my good sir i am surprised that a man of your capacity should be the dupe of such a thing i should not be surprised if hardcastle himself or some of his people wrote it i should said mleod coolly you should cried i warmly why so and why do you pronounce so decidedly my good friend have not i the same means of judging as you have unless indeed you have some private reason with which i am unacquainted perhaps cried i starting half up from the sofa on which i lay charmed with a bright idea which had just struck me perhaps mleod you wrote the letter yourself for a jest did you thats a question my lord said mleod growing suddenly red and snatching up his hat with a quicker motion than i ever saw from him before thats a question my lord which i must take leave not to answer a question give me leave to add my lord glenthorn continued he speaking in a broader scotch accent than i had ever heard from him before which i should knock my equal doon for putting to me a mleod my lord in jest or in earnest would scorn to write to any man breathing that letter to which he would not put his name and more a mleod would scorn to write or to say that thing to which he ought not to put his name your humble servant my lord glenthorn said he and making a hasty bow departed i called after him and even followed him to the head of the stairs to explain and apologize but in vain i never saw him angry before its very weel my lord its very weel if you say you meant nothing offensive its very weel but if you think fit my lord we will sleep upon it before we talk any more i am a wee bit warmer than i could wish and your lordship has the advantage of me in being cool a mleod is apt to grow warm </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> warm when hes touched on the point of honour and theres no wisdom in talking when a mans not his own master my good friend said i seizing his hand as he was buttoning up his coat i like you the better for this warmth but i wont let you sleep upon your wrath you must shake hands with me before that halldoor is opened to you then so i do for theres no standing against this frankness and to be as frank with you my lord i was wrong myself to be so testyi ask pardon too a mleod never thought it a disgrace to crave a pardon when he was wrong we shook hands and parted better friends than ever i spoke the exact truth when i said that i liked him the better for his warmth his anger wakened me and gave me something to think of and some emotion for a few minutes joe kelly presently afterwards came with the simplest face imaginable to inquire what i had determined about the journey to put it off till the day after tomorrow said i light me to bed he obeyed but observed that it was not his fault now if there was puttingsoff for his share every thing was ready and he was willing and ready to follow me at a moments warning to the worlds end as he had a good right to do let alone inclination for parting me he could never be right in himself and though loth to part his country he had rather part that nor84 me then without dwelling upon these expressions of attachment he changed to a merry mood and by his drolleries diverted me all the time i was going to bed and at last fairly talked me asleep </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xv when the first grey light of morning began to make objects indistinctly visible i thought i saw the door of my apartment open very softly i was broad awake and kept my eyes fixed upon itit opened by very slow degrees my head was so full of visions that i expected a ghost to enterbut it was only ellinor ellinor cried i is it you at this time in the morning hush hush said she shutting the door with great precaution and then coming on tiptoe close to my bedside for the love of god speak softly and make no stir to awake them thats asleep near and too near you its unknown to all that i come up for may be when them people are awake and about i might not get the opportunity to speak or they might guess i knew something by my looks her looks were full of terrori was all amazement and expectation before she would say a word more she searched the closets carefully and looked behind the tapestry as if she apprehended that she might be overheard satisfied that we were alone she went on speaking but still in a voice that with my utmost strained attention i could but just hear as you hope to live and breathe said she never go again after nightfall any time walking in that lone place by the seashore its a mercy you escaped as you did but if you go again youll never come back alivefor never would they get you to do what they want and to be as wicked as themselves the wicked villains who said i what wicked villains i do not understand you are you in your right senses that i am and wish you was as much in yours but its time yet by the blessing of god what wicked villains am i talking of of three hundred that have sworn to make you their captain or in case you refuse to have your life this night what villains am i talking of of him the wickedest of all who is now living in the very house with you that is now lying in the very next room to you joe kelly that same from the first minute i saw him in the castle i should have hated him but for his causing you for to put off the journey to england i never could abide him but that blinded me or i am sure i would have found him out long ago and what have you found out concerning him that he is speaking very low a unitedman and stirring up the rubbles again here and they have their meetings at night in the great cave where the smugglers used to hide formerly under the big rock opposite the old abbeyand theres a way up into the abbey that you used to be </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> be so fond of walking to dear good heavens can this be true true it is and too true dear but how did you find all this out ellinor it was none of i found it nor ever could any such things have come into my headbut it pleased god to make the discovery of all by one of the childermy own grandsonthe boy you gave the gun to long and long ago to shoot them rabbits he was after a hare yesterday and it took him a chase over that mountain and down it went and took shelter in the cave and in went the boy after it and as he was groping about he lights on an old great coat and he brought it home with him and was showing it as i was boiling the potatoes for their dinner yesterday to his father forenent me and turning the pockets inside out what should come up but the broken head of a pipe then he sarches in the other pocket and finds a paper written all overi could not read itthank god i never could read none of them wicked things nor could the boyby very great luck he could not being no scholar or it would be all over the country before this well well but what was in the paper after all did any body read it ay did theythat is christy read itnone but christybut he would not tell us what was in itbut said it was no matter and hed not be wasting his time reading an old songso we thought no more and he sent the boy up to the castle with a bill for smiths work as soon as we had eat the potatoes and i thought no more about any things being going wrong no more than a child and in the evening christy said he must go to the funeral of a neighbour and should not be home till early in the morning may be and its not two hours since he came home and wakened me and told me where he had been which was not to the funeral at all but to the cave where the coat was found and he put the coat and the broken head of the pike and the papers all in the pockets just as we found it in the caveand the paper was a list of the names of them rubbles that met there and a letter telling how they would make lord glenthorn their captain or have his life this was what made christy to try and find out moreso he hid hisself in a hole in the side of the cave and built hisself up with rubbish only just leaving a place for hisself to breatheand there he stayed till nightfall and then on till midnight god help us so sure enough them villains all come filling fast into the cave he had good courage god bless him for itbut he always hadand there he heard and saw alland this was how they were talkingfirst one began by saying how they must not be delaying longer to show themselves they must make a rising in the countrythen named the numbers in other parts that would join and that they would not be put down so asy as afore for they would have good leadersthen some praised you greatly and said they was sure you favoured them in your heart by all the illwill you got in the county the time of the last ruction but again others said you was milk and water and did not go far enough and never would and that it was not in you and that you was a sleepy man and not the true thing at all and neither beef nor vael again thim that were for you spoke and said you would show yourself soonand the others made reply and observed you must now spake out or never spake more you must either head em or be tramped under foot along with the rest so it did not signify talking and joey kelly should not be fribbling any more about it and it was a wonder said they he was not the night at the meeting and what was this about your being going off for englandwhat would they do when you was gone with mleod the scotchman to come in over them again agent who was another guess sort of man from you and never slept at all and would scent em out and have his corps after em and that once mleod was master there would be no making any head again his head so not to </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> to be tiring you too much with all they said backward and forward one that was a captain or something that way took the word and bid em all hold their peace for they did not know what they was talking on and said that joey kelly and he had settled it all and that the going to england was put off by joe and all a sham and that when you would be walking out tomorrow at nightfall in those lone places by the seaside or the abbey he and joe was to seize upon you and when you would be coming back near the abbey to have you down through the trapdoor into the cave and any way they would swear you to join and head them and if you would not out with you and shove you into the sea and no more about it for it would be give out you drown yourself in a fit of the melancholy lunacy which none would question and it would be proved too you made away wid yourself by your hat and gloves lying on the banklord save us what are you laughing at in that when it is truth every word and joe kelly was to find the body after a great search well again say you would swear and join them and head them and do whatever they pleased still that would not save you in the end for they would quarrel with you at the first turn because you would not be ruled by them as captain and then they would shoot or pike you god save the mark dear and give the castle to joe kelly and the plunder all among em entirely so it was all laid out and they are all to meet in the cave tomorrow eveningthey will go along bearing a funeral seemingly to the abbeyground and now you know the whole truth and the lord preserve you and what will be done my poor head has no more power to think for you no more than an infants and im all in a tremble ever since i heard it and afraid to meet any one lest they should see all in my face oh what will become of yees nowthey will be the death of you whatever you do by the time she came to these last words ellinors fears had so much overpowered her that she cried and sobbed continually repeatingwhat will be done now what will be done theyll surely be the death of you whatever you do as to me the urgency of the danger wakened my faculties i rose instantly wrote a note to mr mleod desiring to see him immediately on particular business lest my note should by any accident be intercepted or opened i couched it in the most general and guarded terms and added a request that he would bring his last settlement of accounts with him so that it was natural to suppose my business with him was of a pecuniary nature i gradually quieted poor ellinor by my own appearance of composure i assured her that we should take our measures so as to prevent all mischiefthanked her for the timely warning she had given meadvised her to go home before she was observed and charged her not to speak to any one this day of what had happened i desired that as soon as she should see mr mleod coming through the gate she would send christy after him to the castle to get his bill paid so that i might then without exciting suspicion talk to him in private and we might learn from his own lips the particulars of what he saw and heard in the cavern ellinor returned home promising to obey me exactly especially as to my injunction of secrecyto make sure of herself she said she would go to bed straight and have the rheumatism very bad all day so as not to be in a way to talk to none who would call in the note to mleod was despatched by one of my grooms and i returning to bed was now left at full leisure to finish my mornings nap joe kelly presented himself at the usual hour in my room i turned my head away from him and in a sleepy tone muttered that i had passed a bad night and should breakfast in my own apartment some time afterwards mr mleod arrived with an air of sturdy pride and produced his accounts of which i suffered him to talk till the servant who waited upon us had left the room i then explained the real cause of </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> of my sending for him so suddenly i was rather vexed that i could not produce in him by my wonderful narrative any visible signs of agitation or astonishment he calmly observedwe are lucky to have so many hours of daylight before us the first thing we have to do is to keep the old woman from talking i answered for ellinor then the next thing is for me who am a magistrate to take the examinations of her son and see if he will swear to the same that he says christy was summoned into our presence and he came with his bill for smiths work done so that the servants could have no suspicion of what was going forward his examinations were taken and sworn to in a few minutes his evidence was so clear and direct that there was no possibility of doubting the truth the only variation between his story and his mothers report to me was as to the numbers he had seen in the cavernher fears had turned thirteen into three hundred christy assured us that there were but thirteen at this meeting but that they said there were three hundred ready to join them you were a very bold fellow christy said i to hazard yourself in the cave with these villains if you had been found out in your hidingplace they would have certainly murdered you true for me said christy but a man must die some way please your honour and wheres the way i could die better sure i could not but remember how good you was to me that time i was shot and all you suffered for it it would have been bad indeed if i would stay quiet and let em murder you after all no no christy odonoghoe would not do thatany way i hope if theres to be any fighting your honour would not wrong me so much as not to give me a blunderbush and let me fight a bit along wid de rest for yees we are not come to that yet my good fellow said mr mleod who went on methodically if you are precipitate you will spoil all go home to your forge and work as usual and leave the rest to us and i promise that you shall have your share if there is any fighting very reluctantly christy obeyed mr mleod then deliberately settled our plan of operations i had a fishinglodge at a little distance and a pleasureboat there to this place mleod was to go as if on a fishingparty with his nephew a young man who often went there to fish they were to carry with them some yeomen in coloured clothes as their attendants and more were to come as their guests to dinner at the lodge there was a small fourpounder which had been frequently used in times of public rejoicing a naval victory announced in the papers of the day afforded a plausible pretence for bringing it out we were aware that the rebels would be upon the watch and therefore took every precaution to prevent their suspecting that we had made any discovery our fishingparty was to let the mockfuneral pass them quietly to ask some trifling questions and to give money for pipes and tobacco towards evening the boat with the fourpounder on board was to come under shore and at a signal given by me was to station itself opposite to the mouth of the cave at the same signal a trusty man on the watch was to give notice to a party hid in the abbey to secure the trapdoor above the signal was to be my presenting a pistol to the captain of the rebels who intended to meet and seize me on my return from my evenings walk mr mleod at first objected to my hazarding a meeting with this man but i insisted upon it and i was not sorry to give a public proof of my loyalty and my personal courage as to joe kelly i also undertook to secure him mr mleod left me and went to conduct his fishingparty as soon as he was gone i sent for joe kelly to play on the flute to me i guarded my looks and voice as well as i could and he did not see or suspect any thinghe was too full of his own schemes to disguise his own plots he affected great gaiety and to divert me alternately played on the flute and told me good stories all the morning i would not let him leave me the whole day towards evening i began to talk of my journey </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> journey to england proposed setting out the next morning and sent kelly to look for some things in what was called the strong closeta closet with a stout door and ironbarred windows out of which no mortal could make his escape whilst he was busy searching in a drawer i shut the door upon him locked it and put the key into my pocket as i left the castle i said in a jesting tone to some of the servants who met mei have locked joe kelly up in the strong room if he calls to you to let him out never mind him he will not get out till i come home from my walki owe him this trick the servants thought it was some jest and i passed on with my loaded pistols in my pocket i walked for some time by the seashore without seeing any one at last i espied our fishingboat just peering out and then keeping close to the shore i was afraid that the party would be impatient at not seeing my signal and would come out to the mouth of the cave and show themselves too soon if mr mleod had not been their commander this as i afterwards learned would have infallibly happened but he was so punctual cool and peremptory that he restrained the rest of the party declaring that if it were till midnight he would wait till the signal agreed upon was given at last i saw a man creeping out of the cavei sat down upon my wonted stone and yawned as naturally as i could then began to describe figures in the sand with my stick as i was wont to do still watching the image of the man in the water as he approached he was muffled up in a frieze great coat he sauntered past and went on to a turn in the road as if looking for some one i knew well for whom he was looking as no joe kelly came to meet him he returned in a few minutes towards me i had my hand upon the pistol in my pocket you are my lard glenthorn i presume said he i am then you will come with me if you plase my lard said he make no resistance or i will shoot you instantly cried i presenting my pistol with one hand and seizing him by the collar with the other i dragged him for i had force enough now my energy was roused to the spot appointed for my signal the boat appeared opposite the mouth of the cave every thing answered my expectation there said i pointing to the boat there are my armed friends they have a fourpounderthe match is ready lightedyour plot is discovered go in to your confederates in that cave tell them so the trapdoor is secured above there is no escape for them bid them surrender if they attempt to rush out the grape shot will pour upon them and they are dead men i cannot say that my rebel captain showed himself as stout as i could have wished for the honour of my victory the surprise disconcerted him totally i felt him tremble under my grasp he obeyed my orderswent into the cave to bring his associates to submission his parley with them however was not immediately successful i suppose there were some braver fellows than he amongst them whose counsel might be for open war in the mean time our yeomen landed and surrounded the cave on all sides so that there was no possibility of escape for those within at last they yielded themselves our prisoners i am sorry i have no bloody battle for the entertainment of such of my readers as like horrors but so it was that they yielded without a drop of blood being spilled or a shot fired we let them out of their hidingplace one by one searching each as he issued forth to be secure that they had no concealed weapons after they had given up the arms which were concealed in the cave the next question was what to do with our prisoners as it was now late and they could not all be examined and committed with due legal form to the county gaol mr mleod advised that we should detain them in the place they had chosen for themselves till morning accordingly in the cave we again stowed them and left a guard at each entrance to secure them for the night we returned to the castle i stopped at the gate to tell ellinor and christy that i was safe they were sitting up watching </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> watching for the news the moment ellinor saw me she clasped her hands in an ecstasy of joy but could not speak christy was voluble in his congratulations but in the midst of his rejoicing he could not help reproaching me with forgetting to give him the blunderbush and to let him have a bit of the fighting upon my honour said i there was none or you should have been there oh dont be plaguing and gathering round him now said ellinor sure he is tired and look how hotno wonderlet him get home and to bed ill run and warm it with the pan myself and not be trusting them she would not be persuaded that i did not desire to have my bed warmed but by some short cut got in before us on entering the castlehall i found her with the warmingpan in her hand held back by the inquisitive servants who were all questioning her about the news of which she was the first and not very intelligible enunciator i called for bread and water for my prisoner in the strongroom and then i heard various exclamations of wonder ay it is all true it is no jest joe is at the bottom of all i never liked joe kellyi always knew joe was not the right thingand i always said so and i and i and i and it was but last week i was saying so and it was but yesterday i said so and so i passed through the gossiping crowd with bread and water for my culprit mcleod instantly saw and followed me i will make bold to come with you said he a pent rats a dangerous animali thanked him and acquiesced but there was no need for the precaution when we opened the door we found the conscience or terrorstruck wretch upon his knees and in the most abject terms he implored for mercy from the windows of the room which looked into the castleyard he had heard enough to guess all that had happened i could not bear to look at him after i had set down his food he clung to my knees crying and whining in a most unmanly manner mcleod with indignation loosened him from me threw him back and locked the door cowardice and treachery said he usually go together and courage and sincerity said i and now well go to supper my good friends i hope you are all as hungry as i am i never did eat any meal with so much appetite tis a pity my lord said mcleod but that there was a conspiracy against you every day of your life it seems to do you so much good </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvi what new wonders what new misfortunes ellinor said i as ellinor with a face of consternation appeared again in the morning in my room just as i was going down to breakfast what new misfortunes ellinor oh the worst that could befall me cried she wringing her hands the worst the very worstto be the death of my own child said she with inexpressible horror oh save him save him for the love of heaven dear save him if you dont save him tis i shall be his death she was in such agony that she could not explain herself farther for some minutes it was i gave the information against them all to you but how could i ever have thought owen was one of them my son my own son the unfortunate cratur i never thought but what he was with the militia far away and how could it ever come into my head that owen could have any hand in a thing of the kind but i did not see him last night interrupted i oh he was there one of his own friends one of the military that went with you saw him among the prisoners and came just now to tell me of it that owen should be guilty of the likeoh what could have come over him he must have been out of his rason and against you to be plotting thats what i never will believe if even id hear it from himself but hes among them that were taken last night and will i live to see him go to gaoland will i live to seeno id rather die first a thousand and a thousand times over oh for mercys sake said she dropping on her knees at my feet have pity on me and dont let the blood of my own child be upon me in my old days what would you have me do ellinor </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> ellinor said i much moved by her distress there is but one thing to do said she let him off sure a word from you would be enough for the soldiers that are over them on guard and mr mcleod has not yet seen him and if he was just let escape there would be no more about it and id i engage he shall fly the country the unfortunate cratur and never trouble you more this is all i ask and sure dear you cant refuse it to your own ellinor your old nurse that carried ye in her arms and fed ye with her milk and watched over ye manys the long night and loved ye ay none ever loved or could love ye so well i am sensible of it i am grateful interrupted i but what you ask of me ellinor is impossiblei cannot let him escape but i will do my utmost troth nothing will save him if you would not say the word for him now ah why cannot you let him off then i should lose my honour i should lose my character you know that i have been accused of favouring the rebels alreadyyou saw the consequences of my protecting your other son though he was innocent and injured and bore an excellent character christy ay true but poor owen unlucky as he is and misguided has a better claim upon you how can that be is not the other my fosterbrother in the first place true for him and had not i proofs of his generous conduct and attachment to me owen is naturally fonder of you by a great deal interrupted she ill answer for that what when he has just been detected in conspiring against my life thats what ill never believe cried ellinor vehemently that he might be drawn in may be when out of his rasonhe was always a wild boyto be a unitedman and to hope to get you for his captain might be the case and bad enough that but jewel youll find he did never conspire against you id lay down my life upon that she threw herself again at my feet and clung to my knees as you hope for mercy yourself in this world or the world to come show some now and do not be so hardhearted as to be the death of both mother and son her supplicating looks and gestures her words her tears moved me so much that i was on the point of yielding but recollecting what was due to justice and to my own character with an effort of what i thought virtuous resolution i repeated it is impossible my good ellinor urge me no farther ask any thing else and it shall be granted but this is impossible as i spoke i endeavoured to raise her from the ground but with the sudden force of angry despair she resisted no you shall not raise me cried she here let me lie and break my heart with your cruelty tis a judgment upon meits a judgment and its fit i should feel it as i do but you shall feel too in spite of your hard heart yes your heart is harder than the marble you want the natural touch you do for your mother has knelt at your feet and you have denied her prayer my mother and what was her prayerto save the life of your brother my brother good heavens what do i hear you hear the truth you hear that i am your lawful mother yes you are my son you have forced that secret from me which i thought to have carried with me to my grave and now you know all and now you know how wicked i have been and it was all for you for you that refused me the only thing ever i asked and that too in my greatest distress when my heart was just breaking and all this time too theres christypoor good christy he that ive wronged and robbed of his rightful inheritance has been as a son a dutiful good son to me and never did he deny me any thing i could ask but in you i have found no touch of tenderness then its fit i should tell you again and again and again that he who is now slaving at the forge to give me the earnings of his labour he that lives and has lived all his days upon potatoes and salt and is content he who has the face and the hands so disguised with the smoke and the black that yourself asked him </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> him tother day did he ever wash his face since he was borni tell ye he it is who should live in this castle and sleep on that soft bed and be lord of all herehe is the true and real lord glenthorn and to the wide world ill make it known ay be pale and tremble do its your turn now ive touched you now but its too late in the face of day i shall confess the wrong ive done and i shall call upon you to give back to him all that by right is his own ellinor stopped short for one of my servants at this instant came into the room my lord mr mcleod desires me to let you know the guard has brought up the prisoners and he is going to commit them to gaol and would be glad to know if you choose to see them first my lord stupified by all i had just heard i could only reply that i would come presently ellinor rushed past the servantare they come cried she where will i get a sight of them i stayed for a few minutes alone to decide upon what i ought to say and do a multitude of ideas more than had ever come in my mind in a twelvemonth passed through it in these few minutes as i was slowly descending the great staircase ellinor came running as fast as she could run to the foot of the stairs exclaiming its a mistake its all a mistake and i was a fool to believe them that brought me the word sure odys not there at all nor ever was in it ive seen them all face to face and my sons not one of them nor ever was and i was a fool from beginning to endand i beg your pardon entirely whispered she coming close to my ear i was out of my reason at the thought of that boys being to suffer and i his mother the cause of it forgive all i said in my passion my own best jewel you was always good and tender to me and be the same still dear ill never say a word more about it to any one living the secret shall die with me sure when my conscience has borne it so long it may strive and bear it a little longer for your sake and it cant be long i have to live so that will make all easy hark they are asking for you do you go your ways into the great parlour to mr mcleod and think no more of any thing at all but joy my sons not one of them i must go to the forge and tell christy the good news ellinor departed quite satisfied with herself with me and with all the world she took it for granted that she left me in the same state of mind and that i should obey her injunctions and think of nothing but joy of what happened in the great parlour and of the examinations of the prisoners i have but a confused recollection i remember that mr mcleod seemed rather surprised by my indifference to what concerned me so nearly and that he was obliged to do all the business himself the men were i believe all committed to gaol and joe kelly turned kings evidence but as to any further particulars i know no more than if i had been in a dream the discovery which ellinor had just made to me engrossed all my powers of attention </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvii le vrai nest pas toujours vraisemblable says an acute observer of human affairs the romance of real life certainly goes beyond all other romances and there are facts which few writers would dare to put into a book as there are skies which few painters would venture to put into a picture when i had leisure to reflect i considered that as yet i had no proof of the truth of ellinors strange story except her own assertions i sent for her again to examine her more particularly i was aware that if i alarmed her i should so confuse her imagination that i should never obtain the truth therefore i composed myself and assumed my usual external appearance of nonchalance i received her lolling upon my sofa as usual and i questioned her merely as if to gratify an idle curiosity troth dear said she ill tell you the whole story how it was to make your mind asy which god knows mine never was from that minute it first came into my head till this </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> this very time being you mind the time you got the cut in your headno not you jewel but the little lord that was then christy there below that iswell the cut was a terrible cut as ever you seen got by a fall on the fender from the nurses arms that was drunk three days after he was born i remember to have heard my father talk of some accident of this sort which happened to me when i was an infant ay sure enough it did and that was what first put him in the notion of taking the little lord out of the hands of the dublin nursetenders and them that were about my lady glenthom and did not know how to manage her which was the cause of her death and he said hed have his own way about his son and heir any way and have him nursed by a wholesome woman in a cabin and brought up hardy as he and the old lord and all the family were before him so with that he sends for me and he puts the young lord god bless him into my arms himself and a donny thing he was that same time to look at for he was but just out of the surgeons hands the head just healed and scarred over like and my lord said there should be no more doctors never about him so i took him that is christy and you to a house at the sea for the salt water and showed him every justice and my lord often came to see him whilst he was in the country but then he was off after a time to dublin and i was in a lone place where nobody came and the child was very sick with me and you was all the time as fine and thriving a child as ever you see and i thought to be sure one night that he would die wid me he was very bad very bad indeed and i was sitting up in bed rocking him backwards and forwards this ways i thought with myself what a pity it was the young lord should die and he an only son and heir and the estate to go out of the family the lord knows where and then the grief the father would be in and then i thought how happy he would be if he had such a fine babby as you dear and you was a fine babby to be sure and then i thought how happy it would be for you if you was in the place of the little lord and then it came into my head just like a shot where would be the harm to change you for i thought the real lord would surely die and then what a gain it would be to all if it was never known and if the dead child was carried to the grave since it must go as only poor ellinor odonoghoes and no more about it well if it was a wicked thought it was the devil himself put it in my head to be sure for only for him i should never have had the sense to think of such a thing for i was always innocent like and not worldly given but so it was the devil put it in my head and made me do it and showed me how and all in a minute so i mind your eyes and hair were both of the very same colour dear and as to the rest theres no telling how those young things alter in a few months and my lord would not be down from dublin in a hurry so i settled it all right and as there was no likelihood at all the real lord would live that quieted my conscience for i argued it was better the father should have any sort of child at all than none so when my lord came down i carried him the child to see that is you jewel he praised me greatly for all the care i had taken of his boy and said how finely you was come on and i never see a father in greater joy and it would have been a sin i thought to tell him the truth after he took the change that was put upon him so well and it made him so happy like well i was afeard of my life hed pull off the cap to search for the scar so i would not let your head be touched any way dear saying it was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was tinder and soft still with the fall and youd cry if the cap was stirred and so i made it out indeed very well for god forgive me i twitched the string under your chin dear and made you cry like mad when they would come to touch you so there was no more about it and i had you home to myself and all in good time the hair grew and fine thick hair it was god bless you and so there was no more about it and i got into no trouble at all for it all fell out just as i had laid it out except that the real little young lord did not die as i thought and it was a wonder but he did for you never saw none so near death and backwards and forwards what turns of sickness he took with me for months upon months and year after year so that none could think no more than me there was any likelihood at all of rearing him to mans estate so that kept me easier in my mind concerning what id done for as i kept saying to myself better the family should have an heir to the estate suppose not the right than none at all and if the father nor nobody never found it out there was he and all the family made happy for life and my child made a lord of and none the wiser or the worse well so i downargued my conscience and any way i took to little christy as he was now to be calledand i loved him all as one as if he was my ownnot that he was ever as welllooking as ody or any of the childer i had but i never made any differ betwixt him and any of my ownhe cant say as i did any how and he has no reason to complain of my being an unnatral mother to him and being my fosterchild i had a right to love him as i did and i never wronged him in any way except in the one article of changing him at nurse which he being an infant and never knowing wa never a bit the worse for nor never will now so alls right dear and make your mind asy jewel theres the whole truth of the story for you but it is a very strange story ellinor after all andand i have only your word for it and may be you are only taking advantage of my regard for you to make me believe you what is it plase your honour said she stepping forward as if she did not hear or understand me i say ellinor that after all i have no proof of the truth of this story except your word and is not that enough and wheres the use of having more but if it will make you asy sure i can give you proofsure need you go farther than the scar on his head if he was shaved tomorrow id engage youd see it fast enough but sure cant you put your hand up to your head this minute and feel there never was no scar there nor if all the hair you have god save the mark was shaved this minute never a bit of a scar would be to be seen but proof is it you wantwhy theres the surgeon that dressed the cut in the childs head before he ever came to me sure hes the man that cant forget it and that will tell all so to make your mind asy see him dear but for your life dont let him see your head to feel it for hed miss the scar and might suspect something by your going to question him where does he live interrupted i not above twelve miles off is he alive ay if he beent dead since candlemas at first i thought of writing to this man but afterwards being afraid of committing myself by writing i went to him he had long before this time left off business and had retired to enjoy his fortune in the decline of life he was a whimsical sort of character he had some remains of his former taste for anatomy and was a collector of curiosities i found him just returned from a lake which he had been dragging for a moosedeers horns to complete the skeleton of a moosedeer which he had mounted in his hall i introduced myself desiring to see his museum and mentioned to him the thighbone of a giant found in ray neighbourhood then by </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> by favour of this bone i introduced the able cure that he had made of a cut in my head when i was a child a cut in your head sir yes my lord i recollect perfectly well it was a very ugly cut especially in an infants head but i am glad to find you feel no bad effects from it have you any cicatrice on the placeeleven feet high did you say and is the giants skeleton in your neighbourhood i humoured his fancy and by degrees he gave me all the information i wanted without in the least suspecting my secret motives he described the length breadth and depth of the wound to me showed me just where it was on the head and observed that it must have left an indelible mark but that my fine hair covered it when he seemed disposed to search for it i defended myself with the giants thighbone and warded off his attacks most successfully to satisfy myself upon this point i affected to think that he had not been paid he said he had been amply paid and he showed me his books to prove it i examined the dates and found that they agreed with ellinors precisely on my return home the first thing i did was to make christy a present of a new wig which i was certain would induce him to shave his head for the lower irish agree with the beaux and belles of london and paris in preferring wigs to their own hair ellinor told me that i might safely let his head be shaved because to her certain knowledge he had scars of so many cuts which he had received at fairs upon his skull that there would appear nothing particular in one more or less as soon as the head was shaved and the wig was worn i took an opportunity one day of stopping at the forge to have one of my horses shoes changed and whilst this was doing i took notice of his new wig and how well it fitted him as i expected he took it off to show it me better and to pay his own compliments to it sure enough you are a very fine wig said he apostrophising it as he held it up on the end of his hammer and god bless him that give it me and it fits me as if it was nailed to my head you seem to have had a good many nails in your head already christy said i if one may judge by all these scars oh yes please your honour my lord said he theres no harm in them neither they are scratches got when i was no wiser than i should be at fairs fighting with the boys of shrawdnascoob whilst he fought his battles oer again i had leisure to study his head and i traced precisely all the boundary lines the situation size and figure of the cicatrice which the surgeon and ellinor had described to me were so visible and exact that no doubt could remain in my mind of christys being the real son of the late lord and lady glenthorn this conviction was still more impressed upon my mind a few days afterwards i recollected having seen a file of family pictures in a lumberroom in the castle and i rummaged them out to see if i could discover amongst them any likeness to christy i found one the picture of my grandfatheri should say of his grandfather to which christy bore a striking resemblance when i saw him with his face washed and in his sunday clothes my mind being now perfectly satisfied of the truth of ellinors story i was next to consider how i ought to act to be or not to be lord glenthorn or in other words to be or not to be a villain was now the question i could not dissemble to my conscience this plain state of the case that i had no right to keep possession of that which i knew to be anothers lawful property yet educated as i had been and accustomed to the long enjoyment of those luxuries which become necessaries to the wealthy habituated to attendance as i had been and even amongst the dissipated and idle notorious for extravagance the most unbounded and indolence the most inveterate how was i at once to change my habits to abdicate my rank and power to encounter the evils of poverty i was not compelled to make such sacrifices for though ellinors transient passion had prompted her to threaten me with a public discovery </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> discovery yet i knew that she would as soon cut off her own right hand as execute her threats her affection for me and her pride in my consequence were so strong that i knew i might securely rely upon her secrecy the horrid idea of being the cause of the death of one of her own children had for a moment sufficient power to balance her love for me yet there was but little probability that any similar trial should occur nor had i reason to apprehend that the reproaches of her conscience should induce her to make a voluntary discovery for all her ideas of virtue depended on the principle of fidelity to the objects of her affection and no scrupulous notions of justice disturbed her understanding or alarmed her selfcomplacency conscious that she would willingly sacrifice all she had in the world for any body she loved and scarcely comprehending that any one could be selfish she in a confused way applied the maxim of do as you would be done by and was as generous of the property of others as of her own at the worst if a lawsuit commenced against me i knew that possession was nine points of the law i also knew that ellinors health was declining and that the secret would die with her unlawful possession of the wealth i enjoyed could not however satisfy my own mind and after a severe conflict between my love of ease and my sense of rightbetween my tastes and my principlesi determined to act honestly and honourably and to relinquish what i could no longer maintain without committing injustice and feeling remorse i was perhaps the more ready to do rightly because i felt that i was not compelled to it the moment when i made this virtuous decision was the happiest i had at that time ever felt my mind seemed suddenly relieved from an oppressive weight my whole frame glowed with new life and the consciousness of courageous integrity elevated me so much in my own opinion that titles and rank and fortune appeared as nothing in my estimation i rang my bell eagerly and ordered that christy odonoghoe should be immediately sent for the servant went instantly but it seemed to me an immoderately long time before christy arrived i walked up and down the room impatiently and at last threw myself at full length upon the sofa the servant returned the smith is below in the hall my lord show him uphe was shown up into the antechamber the smith is at the door my lord show him in cannot you what detains him my brogues my lord id be afraid to come in with em on the carpet saying this christy came in stepping fearfully astonished to find himself in a splendid drawingroom were you never in this room before christy said i never my lord plase your honour barring the day i mended the bolt it is a fine room is not it christy troth it is the finest ever i see sure enough how should you like to have such a room of your own christy is it i plase your honour replied he laughing what should i do with the like how should you feel if you were master of this great castle its a poor figure i should make to be sure said he turning his head over his shoulder towards the door and resting upon the lock id rather be at the forge by a great dale are you sure of that christy should not you like to be able to live without working any more and to have horses and servants of your own what would i do with them plase your honour i that have never been used to them sure theyd all laugh at me and id not be the better o that no more than of having nothing to do i that have been always used to the work what should i do all the day without it but sure my lord continued he changing his voice to a more serious tone the horse that i shod yesterday for your honour did not go lame did he the horse is very well shod i believe i have not ridden him since i know nothing of the matter because i was thinking may be it was that made your honour send for me up in the hurryi was afeard id find your honour mad with me and id be very sorry to disoblige you my lord and im glad to see your honour looking so well after all the trouble youve been put to by them rubbles </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> rubbles the villains to be consarting against you underground but thanks be to god you have em all in gaol now i thought my mother would have died of the fright she took when the report came that ody was one of them i told her there could not be no truth in it at all but she would not mind me it would be a strange unnatural thing indeed of any belonging to her to be plotting against your honour i knew ody could not be in it and be a brother of mine and thats what i kept saying all the time but she never heeded me for your honour knows when the women are frighted and have taken a thing into their heads you cant asy get it out again very true but to return to what i was saying should not you like to change places with me if you could your honour my lord is a very happy jantleman and a very good jantleman theres no doubt and theres few but would be proud to be like you in any thing at all thank you for that compliment but now in plain english as to yourself would you like to be in my placeto change places with me in your honours placei i would not my lord and thats the truth now said he decidedly i would not no offenceyour honour bid me to speak the truth for ive all i want in the world a good mother and a good wife and good childer and a reasonable good little cabin and my little pratees and the grazing of the cow and work enough always and not called on to slave and i get my health thank god for all and what more could i have if i should be made a lord tomorrow sure my good woman would never make a lady and what should i do with her id be grieved to see her the laughingstock of high and low besides being the same myself and my boy after me that would never answer for me so i am not like them that would overturn all to get uppermost i never had any hand art or part in a thing of the kind i always thought and knew i was best as i am not but what if i was to change with any it is with you my lord i would be proud to change because if i was to be a jantleman at all id wish to be of a raal good ould family born you are then what you wish to be said i och said he laughing and scratching his head your honours jesting me about them kings of ireland that they say the odonoghoes was once but thats what i never think on thats all idle talk for the like of me for sure thats a long time ago and what use going back to it one might as well be going back to adam that was the father of all but which makes no differ now but you do not understand me interrupted i i am not going back to the kings of ireland i mean to tell you that you were born a gentlemannay i am perfectly serious listen to me i do plase your honour though it is mocking me i know you are i would be sorry not to take a joke as well as another this is no joke i repeat that i am serious you are not only a gentleman but a nobleman to you this castle and this great estate belongs and to you they shall be surrendered he stood astonished and his eyes opening wide showed a great circle of white in his black face eh cried he drawing that long breath which astonishment had suppressed but how can this be your mother can explain better than i can your mother did i say she is not your mother lady glenthorn was your mother i cant understand it at alli cant understand it at all ill lave it all to your honour said he making a motion with his hands as if to throw from him the trouble of comprehending it did you never hear of such a thing as a childs being changed at nurse i did plase your honour but my mother would never do the like ill answer for her any way and them that said any thing of the kind belied her and dont be believing them my lord but ellinor was the person who told me this secret was she so oh she must have been draaming she was always too </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> too good a mother to me to have sarved me so but added he struggling to clear his intellects you say its not my mother she is but whose mother is she then can it be that she is yours tis not possible to think such a great lord was the son of such as her to look at you both and was you the son of my father johnny odonoghoe how is that again he rubbed his forehead and i could scarcely forbear laughing at his odd perplexity though the subject was of such serious importance when he clearly understood the case and thoroughly believed the truth he did not seem elated by this sudden change of fortune he really thought more of me than of himself well ill tell you what you will do then continued he after a pause of deep reflection say nothing to nobody but just keep asy on even as we are dont let there be any surrendering at all and ill speak to my mother that is ellinor odonoghoe and settle it so and let it be so settled in the name of god and no more about it and none need never be the wiser tis so best for all a good day to your honour and ill go shoe the mare stay said i you may hereafter repent of this sudden determination i insist upon your taking fourandtwenty hoursno that would be too littletake a month to consider of it coolly and then let me know your final determination oh plase your honour i will say the same then as now it would be a poor thing indeed of me after all you done for me and mine to be putting you to more trouble it would be a poor thing of me to forget how you liked to have lost your life all along with me at the time of the ruction no ill not take the fortin from you any how put gratitude to me out of the question said i far be it from me to take advantage of your affectionate temper i do not consider you as under any obligations to me nor will i be paid for doing justice sure enough your honour desarved to be born a gentleman said christy at least i have been bred a gentleman said i let me see you again this day month and not till then you shall notthat is you shall plase your honour but for fear any one would suspect any thing id best go shoe the mare any way </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xviii what riches give us let us then inquire meat fire and clotheswhat moremeat clothes and fire the philosophy we learn from books makes but a faint impression upon the mind in comparison with that which we are taught by our own experience and we sometimes feel surprised to find that what we have been taught as maxims of morality prove true in real life after having had for many years the fullest opportunities of judging of the value of riches when i reflected upon my past life i perceived that their power of conferring happiness is limited nearly as the philosophic poet describes that all the changes and modifications of luxury must in the sum of actual physical enjoyment be reduced to a few elementary pleasures of which the industrious poor can obtain their share a small share perhaps but then it is enjoyed with a zest that makes it equal in value perhaps to the largest portion offered to the sated palate of ennui these truths are as old as the world but they appeared quite new to me when i discovered them by my own experience during the month which i had allowed to my fosterbrother for reflection i had leisure to philosophize and my understanding made a rapid progress i foresaw the probability of christys deciding to become earl of glenthorn notwithstanding that his good sense had so clearly demonstrated to him in theory that with his education and habits he must be happier working in his forge than he could be as lord of glenthorn castle i was not dismayed by the idea of losing my wealth and rank i was pleased with myself for my honest conduct and conscious of a degree of pleasure from my own approbation superior to what my riches had ever procured the day appointed for christys final determination arrived i knew by the first motion of his shoulder as he came into the room what his decision would be well christy said i you will be earl of glenthorn i perceive you are glad now that i did not take you </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> you at your word and that i gave you a months time for consideration your honour was always considerate but if id wish now to be changing my mind said he hesitating and shifting from leg to leg it is not upon my own account any way but upon my son johnnys my good friend said i no apology is necessary i should be very unjust if i were offended by your decision and very mean if after the declarations i have made i could for an instant hesitate to restore to you that property which it is your right and your choice to reclaim christy made a low bow and seemed much at a loss what he was to say next i hope continued i that you will be as happy when you are earl of glenthorn as you have been as christy odonoghoe may be not plase your honour but i trust my childer will be happy after me and its them and my wife im thinking of as in duty bound but it is hard your honour should be astray for want of the fortin youve been bred to and this weighs with me greatly on the other side if your honour could live on here and share with usbut i see your honours displeased at my naming that it was my wife thought o that i knew it could not do but then what i think is that your honour should name what you would be pleased to keep to live upon for to be sure you have a right to live as a gentleman that have always lived as one as every body knows and none better than i would your honour be so kind then as just to put down on a bit of paper what youd wish to keep and that same whatever it is none shall touch but yourself and i would not own a child for mine that would begrudge it you ill step down and wait below while your honour writes what you plase the generosity of this man touched me to the heart i accepted from him three hundred a year and requested that the annuity i allowed to the unfortunate lady glenthorn might be continued that the house which i had built for ellinor and the land belonging to it might be secured to her rentfree for life and that all my debts should be paid i recommended mr mleod in the strongest manner as an agent whose abilities and integrity would be to him an invaluable treasure christy when i gave him the paper on which i had stated these requests took a pen instantly and would have signed his name without reading it but to this i absolutely objected well then said he ill take it home and read it over and take time as you desire to consider theres no danger of my changing my mind about this i hope your honour cant think there is the next day on returning it to me he observed that it was making very little of him to put down only such a trifle and he pressed me to make the hundreds thousandsthis i refused but i hope your honour wont object to what i am going to propose is not there a house in london and is not there another in england in the country and sure i and mine cant live there and here and every where at once if youd just condescend to occupy one of them youd do me a great pleasure and a great sarvice too for every thing would be right instead of going wrong as it might under an agent and me at a distance that does not know well how to manage such great estates i hope youll not refuse me that if its only to show me i dont lose your honours goodwill the offer was made with so much earnestness and even delicacy that i could not abruptly refuse it at the moment though one of these magnificent houses could be of no use tome with an income of 300l per annum as to the annuity continued christy that shall be paid as punctual as the day mr mleod will pay it and he shall have it all settled right and put upon a stamp by the lawyers in case any thing should happen me then as to ellinor sure she is my mother for i never can think of her any other way and except in that single article of changing me at nurse was always the best of mothers to me and even that same trick she played me though very wicked </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> wicked to be sure was very natralay very natralto prefar her own flesh and blood if she could and no one could be more sorry for the wrong she did me than she is now there she is crying at home ready to break her heart but as i tell her theres no use in repenting a thing when once it is done and as i forgive her none can ever bring it up against her and as to the house and farm she shall surely have that and shall never want for any thing so i hope your honours mind will be asy on that matter and whatever else you recollect to wish that shall be done if in my power it is with pleasure that i recollect and record all these instances of goodness of heart in poor christy which notwithstanding the odd mixture of absurdity and sense in his language and ideas will i make no doubt please my readers though they cannot affect them as much as they affected me i now prepared for my departure from glenthorn castle never more to return to spare me from unnecessary mortification christy had the wonderful selfcommand to keep the secret faithfully so that none of the people in the neighbourhood nor even my servants had the slightest idea of the truth having long talked of returning to england the preparations for my journey excited no surprise every thing went on as usual except that christy instead of being at the forge was almost every day at the whiskeyshop i thought it proper to speak openly of my affairs to mr mleod he was the only person who could make out a correct list of my debts besides i wished to recommend him as agent to the future earl to whom an honest and able agent would be peculiarly necessary ignorant as he was both of the world and of business and surrounded as he must probably be on his accession to his estate by a herd of vulgar and designing flatterers albeit not easily moved to surprise mr mleod really did for an instant look astonished when i informed him that christy odonoghoe was earl of glenthorn but i must resolve not to stop to describe the astonishment that each individual showed upon this occasion else i shall never have finished my story it was settled that mr mleod should continue agent and for his credit i must observe that after he was made acquainted with my loss of rank and fortune he treated me with infinitely more respect and regard than he had ever shown me whilst he considered me only as his employer our accounts were soon settled and when this was done and they were all regularly signed mr mleod came up to me and in a low voice of great emotion said i am not a man of professions but when i say i am a mans friend i hope i shall ever be found to be so as far as can be in my power and i cannot but esteem and admire the man who has acted so nobly as you have done mleod wrung my hand as he spoke and the tears stood in his eyes i knew that the feeling must indeed be strong which could extort from him even these few words of praise and this simple profession of regard but i did not know till long afterwards the full warmth of his affections and energy of his friendship the very next day unfortunately for me he was obliged to go to scotland to his mother who was dying and at this time i saw no more of him in due legal form i now made a surrender of all claim upon the hereditary property of the earl of glenthorn and every thing was in readiness for my journey during this time poor ellinor never appeared at the castle i went to see her to comfort her about my going away but she was silent and seemingly sullen and would not be comforted ive enough to grieve me said she i know what will be the end of all i see it as plain as if youd told me theres no hiding nothing from a mother no theres no use in striving to comfort me every method which i tried to console her seemed to grieve her more the day before that which was fixed for my departure i sent to desire to see her this request i had repeatedly made but she had from day to day excused herself saying that she was unwell and that she would be up on the morrow at last </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> last she came and though but a few days had elapsed since i had seen her she was so changed in her appearance that i was shocked the moment i beheld her countenance you dont look well ellinor said i sit down no matter whether i sit or stand said she calmly im not long for this world i wont live long after you are gone thats one comfort her eyes were fixed and tearless and there was a dead unnatural tranquillity in her manner they are making a wonderful great noise nailing up the boxes and i seen them cording the trunks as i came through the hall i asked them could i be of any use but they said i could be of none and thats true for when i put my hand to the cord to pull it i had no more strength than an infant it was sevenandtwenty years last midsummerday since i first had you an infant in my arms i was strong enough then and youwas a sweet babby had i seen that time all that would come to pass this day but thats over now i have done a wicked thing but ill send for father murphy and get absolution before i die she sighed deeply then went on speaking more quickly but i can do nothing until you go what time will you go in the morning dear its better go early is it in the coach youll go i see it in the yard but i thought you must leave the coach with all the rest to the rightful heir but my heads not clear about it all i believeand no matter her ideas rambled from one subject to another in an unconnected manner i endeavoured in vain to recall her understanding by speaking of her own immediate interests of the house that was secured to her for life and of the promise that had been made me that she should never want for any thing and that she should be treated with all possible kindness she seemed to listen to me but showed that she did not comprehend what i said by her answers and at every pause i made she repeated the same question what time will you go in the morning dear at last i touched her feelings and she recovered her intellect when i suddenly asked if she would accompany me to england the next morning ay that i will cried she go with you through the wide world she burst into tears and wept bitterly for some time ah now i feel right again said she this is what i wanted but could not cry this many a daynever since the word came to me that you was going and all was lost i assured her that i now expected to be happier than i had ever been oh cried she and have you never been happy all this time what a folly it was for me then to do so wicked a thing and all my comfort was the thinking you was happy dear and what will become of you now and is it on foot youll go her thoughts rambled again whatever way i go you shall go with me said i you are my mother and now that your son has done what he knows to be honest and just he will prosper in the world and will be truly happy and so may you be happy now that you have nothing more to conceal she shook her head its too late said she quite too late i often told christy i would die before you left this place dear and so i will you will see god bless you god bless you and pray to him to forgive me none that could know what ive gone through would ever do the like no not for their own child was he even such as you and that would be hard to find god bless you dear i shall never see you more the hand of death is upon megod for ever bless you dear she died that night and i lost in her the only human being who had ever shown me warm disinterested affection her death delayed for a few days my departure from glenthorn castle i stayed to see her laid in the grave her funeral was followed by crowds of people by many from the general habit of attending funerals by many who wished to pay their court to me in showing respect to the memory of my nurse when the prayers over the dead were ended and the grave closed just as the crowd were </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> were about to disperse i stood up on a monument belonging to the glenthorn family and the moment it was observed that i wished to address the multitude the moving waves were stilled and there was a dead silence every eye was fixed upon me with eager expectation it was the first time in my life that i had ever spoken before numbers but as i was certain that i had something to say and quite indifferent about the manner words came without difficulty amazement appeared in every face when i declared myself to be the son of the poor woman whom we had just interred and when i pointed to the real earl of glenthorn and when i declared that i relinquished to him his hereditary title and lawful property my auditors looked alternately at me and at my fosterbrother seeming to think it impossible that a man with face and hands so black as christys usually were known to be could become an earl when i concluded my narrative and paused the silence still continued all seemed held in mute astonishment and now my good friends continued i let me bid you farewell probably you will never see or hear of me more but whether he be rich or poor or high or lowborn every honest man must wish to leave behind him a fair character therefore when i am gone and as it were dead to you speak of me not as of an impostor who long assumed a name and enjoyed a fortune that was not his own but remember that i was bred to believe myself heir to a great estate and that after having lived till the age of sevenandtwenty in every kind of luxury i voluntarily gave up the fortune i enjoyed the moment i discovered that it was not justly mine that you did indeed interrupted christy and of that i am ready to bear witness for you in this world and in the next god bless and prosper you wherever you go and sure enough he will for he cannot do other than prosper one that deserves it so well i never should have known a sentence of the secret continued he addressing his neighbours if it had not been for his generosity to tell it me and even had i found it out by any maracle where would have been the gain of that to me for you know he could had he been so inclined have kept me out of all by the laway baffled me on till my heart was sick and till my little substance was wasted and my bones rotten in the ground but gods blessing be upon him hes an honest man and done that which many a lord in his place would not have done but a good conscience is a kingdom in itself and that he cannot but have wherever he goesand all which grieves me is that he is going away from us if hed be prevailed with by me hed stay where he is and wed share and share alike but hes too proud for thatand no wonderhe has a right to be proud for no matter who was his mother hell live and die a gentleman every inch of him any man you see may be made a lord but a gentleman a man must make himself and yourselves can witness has not he reigned over us like a gentleman and a raal gentleman and shown mercy to the poor and done justice to all as well as to me and did not he take me by the hand when i was persecuted and none else in the wide world to befrind me and did not he stand up for me against the tyrants that had the sway then ay and did not he put himself to trouble day and night go riding here and there and spaking and writing for me well as they say he loves his ease and thats the worse can be said of him he took all this pains for a poor man and had like to have lost his life by it and now wherever he is and whatever can i help loving and praying for him or could you and since you will go added he turning to me with tears in his eyes take with you the blessings of the poor which they say carry a man straight to heaven if any thing can the surrounding crowd joined with one voice in applauding this speech it is he that has said what we all think cried they following me with acclamations to the castle when they saw the </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> the chaise at the door which was to carry me away their acclamations suddenly ceasedbut is he goingbut cant he stayand is he going this minute troth its a pity and a great pity again and again these honest people insisted upon taking leave of me and i could not force myself away without difficulty they walked on beside my carriage christy at their head and in this species of triumph melancholy indeed but grateful to my heart i quitted glenthorn castle passed through that park which was no longer mine and at the verge of the county shook hands for the last time with these affectionate and generous people i then bid my postilion drive on fast and i never looked back never once cast a lingering look at all i left behind i felt proud of having executed my purpose and conscious i had not the insignificant inefficient character that had formerly disgraced me as to the future i had not distinctly arranged my plans nor was my mind during the remainder of the day sufficiently tranquil for reflection i felt like one in a dream and could scarcely persuade myself of the reality of the events that had succeeded each other with such astonishing rapidity at night i stopped at an inn where i was not known and having no attendants or equipage to command respect from hostlers waiters and innkeepers i was made immediately sensible of the reality at least of the change in my fortune but i was not mortifiedi felt only as if i were travelling incognito and i contrived to go to bed without a valetdechambre and slept soundly for i had earned a sound sleep by exertion both of body and mind </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xix in the morning i awoke with a confused notion that something extraordinary had happened but it was a good while before i recollected myself sufficiently to be perfectly sensible of the absolute and irrevocable change in my circumstances an inn may not appear the best possible place for meditation especially if the moralizers bedchamber be next the yard where carriages roll and hostlers swear perpetually yet so situated i this morning as i lay awake in my bed thought so abstractedly and attentively that i heard neither wheels nor hostlers i reviewed the whole of my past life i regretted bitterly my extravagance my dissipation my waste of time i considered how small a share of enjoyment my wealth had procured either for myself or others how little advantage i had derived from my education and from all my opportunities of acquiring knowledge it had been in my power to associate with persons of the highest talents and of the best information in the british dominions yet i had devoted my youth to loungers and gamesters and epicures and knew that scarcely a trace of my existence remained in the minds of those selfish beings who once called themselves my friends i wished that i could live my life over again and i felt that were it in my power i should live in a manner very different from that in which i had fooled away existence in the midst of my selfreproaches however i had some consolation in the idea that i had never been guilty of any base or dishonourable action i recollected with satisfaction my behaviour to lady glenthorn when i discovered her misconduct i recollected that i had always shown gratitude to poor ellinor for her kindness i recollected with pleasure that when trusted with power i had not used it tyrannically my exertions in favour of my fosterbrother when he was oppressed i remembered with much satisfaction and the steadiness with which i behaved when a conspiracy was formed against my life gave me confidence in my own courage and after having sacrificed my vast possessions to a sense of justice no mortal could doubt my integrity so that upon the whole notwithstanding my past follies i had a tolerably good opinion of myself or rather good hopes for the future i was certain that there was more in me than the world had seen and i was ambitious of proving that i had some personal merit independently of the adventitious circumstances of rank and fortune but how was i to distinguish myself just as i came to this difficult question the chambermaid interrupted my reverie by warning me in a shrill voice that it was very late and that she had called me above two hours before wheres my man send up my man oh i beg your pardonnothing at all only my good girl i should be obliged to you if you could let me have a </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> a little warm water that i may shave myself it was new and rather strange to me to be without attendants but i found that when i was forced to it i could do things admirably well for myself that i had never suspected i could perform without assistance after i had travelled two days without servants how i had travelled with them was the wonder i once caught myself saying of myself that careless blockhead has forgotten my nightcap for some time i was liable to make odd blunders about my own identity i was apt to mistake between my old and my new habits so that when i spoke in the tone and imperative mood in which lord glenthorn had been accustomed to speak people stared at me as if i were mad and i in my turn was frequently astonished by their astonishment and perplexed by their ease of behaviour in my presence upon my arrival in dublin i went to a small lodging which mr mleod had recommended to me it was such as suited my reduced finances but at first view it was not much to my taste however i ate with a good appetite my very frugal supper upon a little table covered with a little tablecloth on which i could not wipe my mouth without stooping low the mistress of the house a northcountry woman was so condescending as to blow my fire remarking at the same time that coals were a very scarce article she begged to know whether i would choose a fire in my bedroom and what quantity of coals she should lay in she added many questions about boarding and smallbeer and tea and sugar and butter and blankets and sheets and washerwomen which almost overwhelmed my spirits and must i think of all these things for myself said i in a lamentable tone and i suppose with a most deplorable length of face for the woman could not refrain from laughing as she left the room i heard her exclaim lord help him he looks as much astray as if he was just new from the isle of skye the cares of life were coming fast upon me and i was terrified by the idea of a host of petty evils i sat ruminating with my feet upon the bars of the grate till past midnight when my landlady who seemed to think it incumbent upon her to supply me with common sense came to inform me that there was a good fire burning to waste in the bedroom and that i should find myself a great deal better there than sitting over the cinders i suffered myself to be removed to the bedchamber and again established my feet upon the upper bar of the grate lack sir youll burn your boots said my careful landlady who after bidding me good night put her head back into the room to beg i would be sure to rake the fire and throw up the ashes safe before i went to bed left to my own meditations i confess i did feel rather forlorn i reflected upon my helplessness in all the common business of life and the more i considered that i was totally unfit for any employment or profession by which i could either earn money or distinguish myself the deeper became my despondency i passed a sleepless night vainly regretting the time that never could be recalled in the morning my landlady gave me some letters which had been forwarded for me from glenthorn castle the direction to the earl of glenthorn scratched out and in its place inserted my new address c odonoghoe esq no 6 dukestreet dublin i remember i held the letters in my hand contemplating the direction for some minutes and at length reading it aloud repeatedly to my landladys infinite amusementshe knew nothing of my history and seemed in doubt whether to think me extremely silly or mad one of my letters was from lord y an irish nobleman with whom i was not personally acquainted but for whose amiable character and literary reputation i had always even during my days of dissipation peculiar respect he wrote to me to make inquiries respecting the character of a mr lyddell who had just proposed himself as tutor to the son of one of his friends mr lyddell had formerly been my favourite tutor the man who had encouraged me in every species of ignorance and idleness in my present state of mind i was not disposed to speak favourably of this gentleman and i resolved that i would not be instrumental in placing another young nobleman under his guidance </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> guidance i wrote an explicit indignant and i will say eloquent letter upon this occasion but when i came to the signature i felt a repugnance to signing myself c odonoghoe and i recollected that as my history could not yet be public lord y would be puzzled by this strange name and would be unable to comprehend this answer to his letter i therefore determined to wait upon his lordship and to make my explanations in person besides my other reasons for determining on this visit i had a strong desire to become personally acquainted with a nobleman of whom i had heard so much his lordships porter was not quite so insolent as some of his brethren and though i did not come in a showy equipage and though i had no laced footmen to enforce my rights i gained admission i passed through a gallery of fine statues to a magnificent library which i admired till the master of the house appeared and from that moment he commanded or rather captivated my attention lord y was at this time an elderly gentleman in his address there was a becoming mixture of ease and dignity he was not what the french call manir his politeness was not of any particular school but founded on those general principles of good taste good sense and goodnature which must succeed in all times places and seasons his desire to please evidently arose not from vanity but benevolence in his conversation there was neither the pedantry of a recluse nor the coxcombry of a man of the world his knowledge was select his wit without effort the play of a cultivated imagination the happiness of his expressions did not seem the result of care and his allusions were at once so apposite and elegant as to charm both the learned and the unlearned all he said was sufficiently clear and just to strike every person of plain sense and natural feeling while to the man of literature it had often a further power to please by its less obvious meaning lord ys superiority never depressed those with whom he conversed on the contrary they felt themselves raised by the magic of politeness to his level instead of being compelled to pay tribute they seemed invited to share his intellectual dominion and to enjoy with him the delightful preeminence of genius and virtue i shall be forgiven for pausing in my own insignificant story to dwell on the noble character of a departed friend that he permitted me to call him my friend i think the greatest honour of my life but let me if i can go on regularly with my narrative lord y took it for granted during our first halfhours conversation that he was speaking to the earl of glenthorn he thanked me with much warmth for putting him on his guard against the character of mr lyddell and his lordship was also pleased to thank me for making him acquainted as he said with my own character for convincing him how ill it had been appreciated by those who imagined that wealth and title were the only distinctions which the earl of glenthorn might claim this compliment went nearer to my heart than lord y could guess my character said i since your lordship encourages me to speak of myself with freedom my character has i hope been much changed and improved by circumstances and perhaps those which might at present be deemed the most unfortunate may ultimately prove of the greatest advantage by urging me to exertionyour lordship is not aware of what i allude to a late event in my singular history continued i taking up the newspapers which lay on his library tablemy singular history has not yet i fancy got into the public newspapers perhaps you will hear it most favourably from myself lord y was politely benevolently attentive whilst i related to him the sudden and singular change in my fortune when i gave an account of the manner in which i had conducted myself after the discovery of my birth tears of generous feeling filled his eyes he laid his hand upon mine when i paused whatever you have lost said he you have gained a friend do not be surprised continued he by this sudden declaration before i saw you this morning your real character was better known to me than you imagine i learnt it from a particular friend of mine of whose judgment and abilities i have the highest opinion mr cecil devereux i saw him just after his marriage and the very evening before they sailed i remember when lady geraldine and he were talking </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> talking of the regret they felt in leaving ireland among the friends whom they lamented that they should not see again perhaps for years you were mentioned with peculiar esteem and affection they called you their generous benefactor and fully explained to me the claim you had to this titlea title which never can be lost but mr devereux was anxious to convince me that he was not influenced by the partiality of gratitude in his opinion of his benefactors talents he repeated an assertion that was supported with much energy by the charming lady geraldine that lord glenthorn had abilities to be any thing tie pleased and the high terms in which they spoke of his talents and the strong proofs they adduced of the generosity of his character excited in my mind a warm desire to cultivate his acquaintance a desire which has been considerably increased within this last hour may i hope that the irish rapidity with which i have passed from acquaintance to friendship may not shock english habits of reserve and may not induce you to doubt the sincerity of the man who has ventured with so little hesitation or ceremony to declare himself your friend i was so much moved by this unexpected kindness that though i felt how much more was requisite i could answer only with a bow and i was glad to make my retreat as soon as possible the very next day his lordship returned my visit to my landladys irrecoverable astonishment and i had increasing reason to regard him with admiration and affection he convinced me that i had interested him in my concerns and told me i must forgive him if he spoke to me with the freedom of a friend thus i was encouraged to consult him respecting my future plans plans indeed i had none regularly formed but lord y by his judicious suggestions settled and directed my ideas without overpowering me by the formality of advice my ambition was excited to deserve his friendship and to accomplish his predictions the profession of the law was that to which he advised me to turn my thoughts he predicted that if for five years i would persevere in application to the necessary preparatory studies i should afterwards distinguish myself at the bar more than i had ever been distinguished by the title of earl of glenthorn five years of hard labour the idea alarmed but did not utterly appal my imagination and to prevent my dwelling upon it too long at the first lord y suddenly changed the conversation and in a playful tone said before you immerse yourself in your studies i must however claim some of your time you must permit me to carry you home with me today to introduce you to two ladies of my acquaintance the one prudent and oldif a lady can ever be old the other young and beautiful and graceful and witty and wise and reasonable one of these ladies is much prepossessed in your favour the other strongly prejudiced against youfor the best of all possible reasons because she does not know you i accepted lord ys invitation not a little curious to know whether it was the old and prudent or the young beautiful graceful witty wise and reasonable lady who was much prepossessed in my favour notwithstanding my usual indifference to the whole race of very agreeable young ladies i remember trying to form a picture in my imagination of this allaccomplished female </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xx upon my arrival at y house i found two ladies in the drawingroom in earnest conversation with lady y in their external appearance they were nearly what my friend had described except that the beauty of the youngest infinitely surpassed my expectations the elegance of her form and the charming expression of her countenance struck me with a sort of delightful surprise that was quickly succeeded by a most painful sensation lady y give me leave to introduce to you mr odonoghoe shocked by the sound of my own name i was ready to recoil abashed the elderly lady turned her eyes upon me for an instant with that indifference with which we look at an uninteresting stranger the young lady seemed to pity my confusion for though so well and so long used to varieties of the highest company when placed in a situation that was new to me i was unaccountably disconcerted ah thought i how differently should i be received were i still earl of glenthorn i was rather angry with lord y for not introducing me as he had promised to this fair lady and yet the repetition of my name would have </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> have increased my vexation in short i was unjust and felt an impatience and irritability quite unusual to my temper lady yaddressed some conversation to me in an obliging manner and i did my best to support my part till she left me but my attention was soon distracted by a conversation that commenced at another part of the room between her and the elderly lady my dear lady y have you heard the extraordinary news the most incredible thing that ever was heard for my part i cannot believe it yet though we have the intelligence from the best authority lord glenthorn that is to say the person we always called lord glenthorn turns out to be the son of the lord knows whothey dont mention the name at this speech i was ready to sink into the earth lord y took my arm and led me into another room i have some cameos said he which are thought curious would you like to look at them can you conceive it continued the elderly lady whose voice i still heard as the foldingdoors of the room were open changed at nurse one hears of such things in novels but in real life i absolutely cannot believe it yet here in this letter from lady ormsby are all the particulars and a blacksmith is found to be earl of glenthorn and takes possession of glenthorn castle and all the estates and the man is married to some vulgarian of course and he has a son and may have half a hundred you know so there is an end of our hopes and there is an end too of all my fine schemes for cecilia i felt myself change colour again i believe said i to lord y i ought not to hear this if your lordship will give me leave i will shut the door no no said he smiling and stopping me you ought to hear it for it will do you a great deal of good you know i have undertaken to be your guide philosopher and friend so you must let me have my own way and if it should so happen hear yourself abused patientlyis not this a fine bust of socrates some part of the conversation in the next room i missed whilst his lordship spoke the next words i heard were but my dear lady y look at ceciliawould not any other girl be cast down and miserable in cecilias place yet see see how provokingly happy and well she looks yes replied lady y i never saw her appear better but we are not to judge of her by what any other young lady would be in her place for i know of none at all comparable to miss delamere miss delamere said i to lord y is this the miss delamere who is heiress at law to the glenthorn estate yesdo not let the head of socrates fall from your hands said his lordship smiling i again lost something that was said in the next room but i heard the old lady going on with i only say my dear that if the man had been really what he was said to be you could not have done better dearest mother you cannot be serious replied the sweetest voice i ever heard i am sure that you never were in earnest upon this subject you could not wish me to be united to such a man as lord glenthorn was said to be why what was he said to be my deara little dissipated a little extravagant only and if he had a fortune to support it child what matter pursued the mother all young men are extravagant nowadaysyou must take the world as it goes the lady who married lord glenthorn i suppose acted upon that principle and you see what was the consequence oh my dear as to her ladyship it ran in the blood let her have married whom she would she would have done the same and i am told lord glenthorn made an incomparably good husband a cousin of lady glenthorns assured me that she was present one day when her ladyship expressed a wish for a gold chain to wear round her neck or braid her hair i forget for what but that very hour lord glenthorn bespoke for her a hundred yards of gold chain at ten guineas a yard another time she longed for an indian shawl and his lordship presented her next day with three dozen real india shawls theres a husband for you cecilia not for me mamma said cecilia laughing ah you are a strange romantic girl </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> girl and never will be married after all i fear never to a fool i hope said cecilia miss delamere will however allow said lady y that a man may have his follies without being a fool or wholly unworthy of her esteem otherwise what a large portion of mankind she would deprive of hope as to lord glenthorn he was no fool i promise you continued the mother has not he been living prudently enough these three years we have not heard of late of any of his extraordinary landaus but i have been told said cecilia that he is quite uninformed without any taste for literature and absolutely incapable of exertiona victim to ennui how miserable a woman must be with such a husband but said lady y what could be expected from a young nobleman bred up as lord glenthorn was nothing said cecilia and that is the very reason i never wished to see him perhaps miss delameres opinion might be changed if she had known him said lady y ay for he is a very handsome man i have heard said the mother lady jocunda lawler told me so in one of her letters and lady jocunda was very near being married to him herself i can tell you for he admired her prodigiously a certain proof that he never would have admired me said cecilia for two women so opposite in every respect no man could have loved lord bless you child how little you know of the matter after all i dare say if you had been acquainted with him you might have been in love yourself with lord glenthorn possibly said cecilia if i had found him the reverse of what he is reported to be company came in at this instant lord y was called to receive them and i followed glad at this instant that i was not lord glenthorn at dinner the conversation turned upon general subjects and lord y with polite and friendly attention drew me out without seeming to do so in the kindest manner possible i had the pleasure to perceive that cecilia delamere did not find me a fool i never even in the presence of lady geraldine exerted myself so much to avoid this disgrace after all the company except mrs and miss delamere were gone lord y called me aside will you pardon said he the means i have taken to convince you how much superior you are to the opinion that has been commonly formed of lord glenthorn will you forgive me for convincing you that when a man has sufficient strength of mind to rely upon himself and sufficient energy to exert his abilities he becomes independent of common report and vulgar opinion he secures the suffrages of the best judges and they in time lead all the rest of the world will you permit me now to introduce you to your prudent friend and your fair enemy mrs delameremiss delameregive me leave to introduce to you the late earl of glenthorn of the astonishment in the opening eyes of mrs delamere i have some faint recollection i can never forget the crimson blush that instantaneously spread over the celestial countenance of cecilia she was perfectly silent but her mother went on talking with increased rapidity good heavens the late lord glenthorn why i was talkingbut he was not in the room the ladies exchanged looks which seemed to say i hope he did not hear all we said of him my dear lord y why did not you tell us this before suppose we had spoken of his lordship you would have been answerable for all the consequences certainly said lord y but seriously said the old lady have i the pleasure to speak to lord glenthorn or have i not i believe i began unluckily to talk of a strange story i had heard but perhaps all this is a mistake and my country correspondent may have been amusing herself at the expense of my credulity i assure you i was not imposed upon i never believed half the story you may believe the whole of it madam said i the story is perfectly true oh my good sir how sorry i am to hear you say it is all true and the blacksmith is really earl of glenthorn and has taken possession of the castle and is married and has a son lord bless me how unfortunate well i can only say sir i wish with all my heart you were earl of glenthorn still after hearing from lord y the circumstances of what he was pleased to call my generous conduct mrs delamere </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> delamere observed that i had acted very generously to be sure but that few in my place would have thought themselves bound to give up possession of an estate which i had so long been taught to believe was my own to have and to hold she observed always went together in law and she could not help thinking i had done very injudiciously and imprudently not to let the law decide for me i was consoled for mrs delameres reprehensions by her daughters approving countenance after this visit lord y gave me a general invitation to his house where i frequently saw miss delamere and frequently compared her with my recollection of lady geraldine cecilia delamere was not so entertaining but she was more interesting than lady geraldine the flashes of her ladyships wit though always striking were sometimes dangerous cecilias wit though equally brilliant shone with a more pleasing and inoffensive light with as much generosity as lady geraldine could show in great affairs she had more forbearance and delicacy of attention on everyday occasions lady geraldine had much pride and it often gave offence cecilia perhaps had more pride but it never appeared except upon the defensive without having less candour she had less occasion for it than lady geraldine seemed to have and cecilias temper had more softness and equability perhaps cecilia was not so fascinating but she was more attractive one had the envied art of appearing to advantage in publicthe other the more desirable power of being happy in private i admired lady geraldine long before i loved her i loved cecilia long before i admired her whilst i possibly could i called what i felt for miss delamere only esteem but when i found it impossible to conceal from myself that i loved i resolved to avoid this charming woman how happy thought i would the fortune i once possessed now make me but in my present circumstances what have i to hope surely my friend lord y has not shown his usual prudence in exposing me to such a temptation but it is to be supposed he thinks that the impossibility of my obtaining miss delamere will prevent my thinking of her or perhaps he depends on the inertness and apathy of my temper unfortunately for me my sensibility has increased since i have become poor for many years when i was rich and could have married easily i never wished to marry and now that i have not enough to support a wife i immediately fall desperately in love again and again i pondered upon my circumstances three hundred ayear was the amount of all my worldly possessions and miss delamere was not rich and she had been bred expensively for it had never been absent from her mothers mind that cecilia would be heiress to the immense glenthorn estate the present possessor was however an excellent life and he had a son stout and healthy so all these hopes of mrs delameres were at an end and as there was little chance as she said laughing of persuading her daughter to marry johnny the young lord and heir apparent it was now necessary to turn her views elsewhere and to form for cecilia some suitable alliance rank and large fortune were in mrs delameres opinion indispensable to happiness cecilias ideas were far more moderate but though perfectly disinterested and generous she was not so romantic or so silly as to think of marrying any man without the probability of his being able to support her in the society of her equals nor even if i could have thought it possible to prevail upon miss delamere to make an unbecoming and imprudent choice would i have taken advantage of the confidence reposed in me by lord y to destroy the happiness of a young friend for whom he evidently had a great regard i resolved to see her no moreand for some weeks i kept my resolution i refrained from going to y house i deem this the most virtuous action of my life it certainly was the most painful sacrifice i ever made to a sense of duty at last lord y came to me one morning and after reproaching me in a friendly manner for having so long absented myself from his house declared that he would not be satisfied with any of those common excuses which might content a mere acquaintance that his sincere anxiety for my welfare gave him a right to expect from me the frankness of a friend it was a relief to my mind to be encouraged in this manner i confessed with entire openness my real motive lord y </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> y heard me without surprise it is gratifying to me said his lordship to be convinced that i was not mistaken in my judgment either of your taste or your integrity permit me to assure you that i foresaw exactly how you would feel and precisely how you would act there are certain moral omens which old experience never fails to interpret rightly and from which unerring predictions of the future conduct and consequently of the future fate of individuals may be formed i hold that we are the artificers of our own fortune if there be any whom the gods wish to destroy these are first deprived of understanding whom the gods wish to favour they first endow with integrity inspire with understanding and animate with activity have i not seen integrity in you and shall i not see activity yes that supineness of temper or habit with which you reproach yourself has arisen believe me only from want of motive but you have now the most powerful of motives and in proportion to your exertions will be your success in our country you know the highest offices of the state are open to talents and perseverance a man of abilities and application cannot fail to secure independence and obtain distinction time and industry are necessary to prepare you for the profession to which you will hereafter be an honour and you will courageously submit time and industry the mighty two which bring our wishes nearer to our view as to the probability that your present wishes may be crowned with success i can judge only from my general knowledge of the views and disposition of the lady whom you admire i know that her views with respect to fortune are moderate and that her disposition and excellent understanding will in the choice of a husband direct her preference to the essential good qualities and not to the accidental advantages of the candidates for her favour as to the mothers influence that will necessarily yield to the daughters superior judgment cecilia possesses over her mother that witchcraft of gentle manners which in the female sex is always irresistible even over violent tempers prudential considerations have a just though not exclusive claim to miss delameres attention but her relations i fancy could find means of providing against any pecuniary embarrassments if she should think proper to unite herself to a man who can be content as she would be with a competence and who should have proved himself able by his own exertions to maintain his wife in independence on this last condition i must dwell with emphasis because it is indispensable and i am convinced that without it miss delameres consent even after she is of age and at liberty to judge for herself could never be obtained you perceive then how much depends upon your own exertions and this is the best hope and the best motive that i can give to a strong and generous mind farewellpersevere and prosper such was the general purport of what lord y said to me indeed i believe that i have repeated his very words for they made a great and ineffaceable impression upon my mind from this day i date the commencement of a new existence fired with ambitioni hope generous ambitionto distinguish myself among men and to win the favour of the most amiable and the most lovely of women all the faculties of my soul were awakened i became active permanently active the enchantment of indolence was dissolved and the demon of ennui was cast out for ever </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxi if among those who maybe tempted to peruse my history there should be any mere novel readers let me advise them to throw the book aside at the commencement of this chapter for i have no more wonderful incidents to relate no more changes at nurse no more sudden turns of fortune i am now become a plodding man of business poring over lawbooks from morning till night and leading a most monotonous life yet occupation and hope and the constant sense of approaching nearer to my object rendered this mode of existence dull as it may seem infinitely more agreeable than many of my apparently prosperous days when i had more money and more time than i knew how to enjoy i resolutely persevered in my studies about a month after i came to town the doors of my lodging were blockaded by half a dozen cars loaded with huge packingcases on which i saw in the handwriting which i remembered often to have seen in my blacksmiths bills a direction to christopher odonoghoe esquirethis side upwards to be kept dry one of </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> of the carmen fumbled in what he called his pocket and at last produced a very dirty note my dear and honourable fosterbrother larning from mr mleod that you are thinking of studdeing i send you inclosed by the bearer who is to get nothing for the carrige all the bookes from the big bookeroom at the castle which i hope being of not as much use as i could wish to me your honour will not scorn to accept with the true veneration of your everloving fosterbrother and grateful humble servant to command ps no name needful for you will not be astray about the hand this goodnatured fellows present was highly valuable and useful to me among my pleasures at this studious period of my life when i had few events to break the uniform tenor of my days i must mention letters which i frequently received from mr devereux and lady geraldine who still continued in india mr devereux was acquainted with almost all the men of eminence at the irish bar men who are not mere lawyers but persons of literature of agreeable manners and gentlemanlike habits mr desvereux wrote to his friends so warmly in my favour that instead of finding myself a stranger in dublin my only difficulty was how to avoid the numerous invitations which tempted me from my studies those gentlemen of the bar who were intimate with mr devereux honoured me with particular attention and their society was peculiarly useful as well as agreeable to me they directed my industry to the best and shortest means of preparing myself for their profession they put into my hands the best books told me all that experience had taught them of the art of distinguishing in the mass of lawprecedents the useful from the useless instructed me in the methods of indexing and commonplacing and gave me all those advantages which solitary students so often want and the want of which so often makes the study of the law appear an endless maze without a plan when i found myself surrounded with books and reading assiduously day and night i could scarcely believe in my own identity i could scarcely imagine that i was the same person who but a few months before this time lolled upon a sofa half the day and found it an intolerable labour to read or think for half an hour together such is the power of motive during the whole time i pursued my studies and kept my terms in ireland the only relaxation i allowed myself was in the society at lord ys house in dublin and during my vacations in excursions which i made with his lordship to different parts of the country lord y had two countryseats in the most beautiful parts of ireland how differently the face of nature appeared to me now with what different sensations i beheld the same objects no brighter colours paint th enamelld fields no sweeter fragrance now the garden yields whence then this strange increase of joy is it to love these new delights i owe it was not to love that i owed these new delights for cecilia was not there but my powers of observation were awakened and the confinement and labour to which i had lately submitted gave value to the pleasures of rest and liberty and to the freshness of country air and the beautiful scenes of nature so true it is that all our pleasures must be earned before they can be enjoyed when i saw on lord ys estates and on those of several other gentlemen which he occasionally took me to visit the neat cottages the wellcultivated farms the air of comfort industry and prosperity diffused through the lower classes of the people i was convinced that much may be done by the judicious care and assistance of landlords for their tenantry i saw this with mixed sensations of pleasure and of painof pain for i reflected how little i had accomplished and how ill i had done even that little whilst the means of doing good to numbers had been in my power for the very trifling services i did to some of my poor tenants i am sure i had abundant gratitude and i was astonished and touched by instances of this shown to me after i had lost my fortune and when i scarcely had myself any remembrance of the people who came to thank me trivial as it is i cannot forbear to record one of the many instances of gratitude i met with from a poor irishman whilst i was in dublin as i was paying a morning visit to lord </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> lord y sitting with him in his library we heard some disturbance in the inner court and looking out of the window we saw a countryman with a basket on his arm struggling with the porter and two footmen he is here i know to a certainty he is here and i shall see him say what you plase now i tell you my lord is not at home said the porter whats the matter said lord y opening the window see theres my lord himself at the window are not you ashamed of yourself now said the footman and why would i be ashamed that am telling no lies and hindering no one said the countryman looking up to us with so sudden a motion that his hat fell of i knew his face but could not recollect his name oh there he is his own honour ive found him and axe pardon for my boldness but its because ive been all day yesterday and this day running through dublin after yees and when certified by the lady of the lodgings you was in it here i could not lave town without my errand which is no more than a cheese from my wife of her own making to be given to your honours own hands and she would not see me if i did not do it let him come up said lord y this continued his lordship turning to me reminds me of henry the fourth and the gascon peasant with his fromages de boeuf but our countryman brings his offering to an abdicated monarch said i the poor fellow presented his wifes cheese to me with as good a grace as any courtier could have made his offering unembarrassed his manners and his words gave the natural and easy expression of a grateful heart he assured me that he and his wife were the happiest couple in all ireland and he hoped i would one day be as happy myself in a wife as i desarved who had made others so and there were many on the estate remembered as well as he did the good i did to the poor during my reign then stepping up closer to me he said in a lower voice im jimmy riley that married ould noonans daughter and now that it is all over i may tell you a bit of a secret which made me so eager to get to the speech of your honour that i might tell it to your own ear aloneno offence to this gentleman before whom id as soon say it as yourself becaase i see he is all as one as another yourself then the thing isdoes your honour remember the boy with the cord round his body looking for the birds eggs in the rock and the nonymous bit of a letter that you got twas i wrote it and the gossoon that threw it to your honour was a cousin of my own that i sent that nobody nor yourself even might not know him and the way i got the information i never can tell till i die and then only to the priest becaase i swore i would not never but dont go for to think it was by being a rubble any way no man can i thank my god charge me with indifferency so rejoiced to see you the same i wish you a good morrow and long life and a happy deathwhen it comes about this time i frequently used to receive presents to a considerable amount and of things which were most useful to me but always without any indication by which i could discover to whom i was indebted for them at last by means of my scotch landlady i traced them to mr mleod his kindness was so earnest and peremptory that it would admit neither thanks nor refusals and i submitted to be obliged to a man for whom i felt such high esteem i looked upon it as not the least of his proofs of regard that he gave me what i knew he valued more than any thing elsehis time whenever he came to dublin though he was always hurried by business so that he had scarcely leisure to eat or sleep he used constantly to come to see me in my obscure lodgings and when in the country though he hated all letterwriting except letters of business yet he regularly informed me of every thing that could be interesting to me glenthorn castle he described as a scene of riotous living and of the most wasteful vulgar extravagance my poor fosterbrother the bestnatured and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> and most generous fellow in the world had not sufficient prudence or strength of mind to conduct his own family his wife filled the castle with tribes of her vagabond relations she chose to be descended from one of the kings of ireland and whoever would acknowledge her high descent and whoever would claim relationship with her were sure to have their claims allowed and were welcome to live in all the barbaric magnificence of glenthorn castle every instance that she could hear of the former lady glenthorns extravagance or of mineand alas there were many upon record she determined to exceed her diamonds and her pearls and her finery surpassed every thing but the extravagance of some of the russian favourites of fortune decked out in the most absurd manner this descendant of kings as mr mleod assured me often indulged in the pleasures of the banquet till no longer able to support the regal diadem she was carried by some of the meanest of her subjects to her bed the thefts committed during these interregnums were amazing in their amount and the jewels of the crown were to be replaced as fast as they were stolen poor christy all this time was considered as a meanspirited cratur who had no notion of living like a prince and whilst his wife and her relations were revelling in this unheardof manner he was scarcely considered as the master of the house he lived by the fireside disregarded in winter and in summer he spent his time chiefly in walking up and down his garden and picking fruit he once made an attempt to amuse himself by mending the lock of his own room door but he was detected in the fact and exposed to such loud ridicule by his ladys favourites that he desisted and sighing said to mr mleodand isnt it now a great hardship upon a man like me to have nothing to do or not to be let do any thing if it had not been for my son johnnys sake i never would have quit the forge and now all will be spent in coshering and johnny at the last will never be a penny the better but the worse for my consinting to be lorded and what grieves me more than all the rest she is such a negre85 that i havent a guinea i can call my own to send as id always laid out to do at odd times such little tokens of my love and duty as would be becoming to my dear fosterbrother there in dublin and now you tell me he is going away too beyond sea to england to finish making a lawyer of himself in london and what friends will he find there without money in his pocket and i had been thinking this while past ever since you gave me notice of his being to quit ireland that i would go up to dublin myself to see him and wish him a good journey kindly before he would go and i had a little compliment here in a private drawer that i had collected unknownst to my wife but here last night she lit upon it and now that her hand has closed upon it not a guinea of it shall i ever see more nor a farthing the better of it will my dear fosterbrother ever be for it or for me and this is what grieves me more than all and goes to the quick of my heart when mr mleod repeated to me these lamentations of poor christy i immediately wrote to set his heart at ease as much as i could by the assurance that i was in no distress for money and that my three hundred a year would support me in perfect comfort and independence while i was making a lawyer of myself in london i farther assured my good fosterbrother that i was so well convinced of his affectionate and generous disposition towards me that it would be quite unnecessary ever to send me tokens of his regard i added a few words of advice about his wife and his affairs which like most words of advice were as i afterwards found absolutely thrown away though i had taken care to live with so much economy that i was not in any danger of being in pecuniary embarrassments yet i felt much distress of another kind in leaving ireland i left miss delamere surrounded with admirers her mother using her utmost art and parental influence to induce cecilia to decide in favour of one of these gentlemen who was a person of rank and of considerable </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> considerable fortune i had seen all this going on and was bound in honour the whole time to remain passive not to express my own ardent feelings not to make the slightest attempt to win the affections of the woman who was the object of all my labours of all my exertions the last evening that i saw her at lord ys just before i sailed for england i suffered more than i thought it was in my nature to feel especially at the moment when i went up to make my bow and take leave of her with all the cold ceremony of a common acquaintance at parting however in the presence of her mother and of lord y cecilia with her sweet smile and i think with a slight blush said a few words upon which i lived for months afterwards i sincerely wish you sir the success your perseverance so well deserves the recollection of these words was often my solace in my lonely chambers in the temple and often after a days hard study the repeating them to myself operated as a charm that dissipated all fatigue and revived at once my exhausted spirits to be sure there were moments when my fire was out and my candle sinking in the socket and my mind overwearied saw things in the most gloomy point of view and at these times i used to give an unfavourable interpretation to cecilias words and i fancied that they were designed to prevent my entertaining fallacious hopes and to warn me that she must yield to her mothers authority or perhaps to her own inclinations in favour of some of her richer lovers this idea would have sunk me into utter despondency and i should have lost with my motive all power of exertion had not i opposed to this apprehension the remembrance of lord ys countenance at the moment cecilia was speaking to me i then felt assured that his lordship at least understood the words in a favourable sense else he would have suffered for me and would not certainly have allowed me to go away with false hopes reanimated by this consideration i perseveredfor it was by perseverance alone that i could have any chance of success it was fortunate for me that stimulated by a great motive i thus devoted my whole time and thoughts to my studies otherwise i must on returning to london have felt the total neglect and desertion of all my former associates in the fashionable world of all the vast number of acquaintance who used to lounge away their hours in my company and partake of the luxuries of my table and the festivities of my house some whom i accidentally met in the street just at my reappearance in town thought proper indeed to know me again at first that they might gratify their curiosity about the paragraphs which they had seen in the papers and the reports which they had heard of my extraordinary change of fortune but no sooner had they satisfied themselves that all they had heard was true than their interest concerning me ceased when they found that instead of being earl of glenthorn and the possessor of a large estate i was now reduced to three hundred a year lodging in small chambers in the temple and studying the law they never more thought me worthy of their notice they affected according to their different humours either to pity me for my misfortunes or to blame me for my folly in giving up my estate but they unanimously expressed astonishment at the idea of my becoming a member of any active profession they declared that it was impossible that i could ever endure the labour of the law or succeed in such an arduous career their prophecies intimidated me not i was conscious that these people did not in the least know me and i hoped and believed that i had powers and a character which they were incapable of estimating their contempt rather excited than depressed my mind and their pity i returned with more sincerity than it was given i had lived their life knew thoroughly what were its pleasures and its pains i could compare the ennui i felt when i was a bondstreet lounger with the selfcomplacency i enjoyed now that i was occupied in a laborious but interesting and honourable pursuit i confess i had sometimes however the weakness to think the worse of human nature for what i called the desertion and ingratitude of these my former companions and flatterers and i could not avoid comparing the neglect and solitude in which i lived in london </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> london where i had lavished my fortune with the kindness and hospitalities i had received in dublin where i lived only when i had no fortune to spend after a little time however i became more reasonable and just for i considered that it was my former dissipated mode of life and imprudent choice of associates which i should blame for the mortifications i now suffered from the desertion of companions who were in fact incapable of being friends in london i had lived with the most worthless in dublin with the best company and in each place i had been treated as in fact i deserved but leaving the history of my feelings i must proceed with my narrative one night after i had dined with an irish gentleman a friend of lord ys at the west end of the town as i was returning late to my lodgings i was stopped for some time by a crowd of carriages in one of the fashionable streets i found that there was a masquerade at the house of a lady with whom i had been intimately acquainted the clamours of the mob eager to see the dresses of those who were alighting from their carriages the gaudy and fantastic figures which i beheld by the light of the flambeaux the noise and the bustle put me in mind of various similar nights of my past life and it seemed to me like a dream or reminiscence of some former state of existence i passed on as soon as the crowd would permit and took my way down a narrow street by which i hoped to get by a shorter way than usual to my quiet lodgings the rattling of the carriages the oaths of the footmen and the shouts of the mob still sounded in my ears and the masquerade figures had scarcely faded from my sight when i saw coming slowly out of a miserable entry by the light of a few wretched candles and lanterns a funeral the contrast struck me i stood still to make way for the coffin and i heard one say to another what matter how shes buried i tell you be at as little expense as possible for hell never pay a farthing i had a confused recollection of having heard the voice before as one of the bearers lifted his lantern i saw the face of the woman who spoke and had a notion of having seen her before i asked whose funeral it was and i was answered it is one mrs crawleyslady glenthorn that was added the woman i heard no more i was so much shocked that i believe i should have fallen in the street if i had not been immediately supported by somebody near me when i recovered my recollection i saw the funeral had moved on some paces and the person who supported me i now found was a clergyman in a mild voice he told me that his duty called him away from me at present but he added that if i would tell him where i could be found he would see me in the morning and give me any information in his power as he supposed that i was interested for this unfortunate woman i put a card with my address into his hands thanked him and got home as well as i could in the morning the clergyman called upon mea most benevolent man unknown to fame but known to all the wretched within the reach of his consolatory religion he gave me a melancholy account of the last days of the unhappy woman whose funeral i had just seen i told him who i was and what she had been to me she had almost in her last moments as he assured me expressed her sense of what she called my generosity to her and had shown deep contrition for her infidelity she died in extreme poverty and wretchedness with no human being who was or even seemed interested for her but a maidservant the woman whose voice i recollected whose services were purchased to the last by presents of whatever clothes or trinkets were left from the wreck of her mistresss fortune crawley it seems had behaved brutally to his victim after having long delayed to perform his promise of marrying her he declared that he could never think of a woman who had been divorced in any other way than a mistress she poor weak creature consented to live with him on any terms but as his passions and his interest soon turned to new objects he cast her off without scruple refusing to pay </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> pay any of the tradesmen who had supplied her while she bore his name he refused to pay the expenses even of her funeral though she had shared with him her annuity and every thing she possessed i paid the funeral expenses and some arrears of the maids wages together with such debts for necessaries as i had reason to believe were justly due the strict economy with which i had lived for three years and the parting with a watch and some other trinkets too fine for my circumstances enabled me to pay this money without material inconvenience and it was a satisfaction to my mind the good clergyman who managed these little matters became interested for me and our acquaintance with each other grew every day more intimate and agreeable when he found that i was studying the law he begged to introduce me to a brother of his who had been one of the most eminent special pleaders in london and who now on a high salary undertook to prepare students for the bar i was rather unwilling to accept of this introduction because i was not rich enough to become a pupil of this gentlemans but my clergyman guessed the cause of my reluctance and told me that his brother had charged him to overrule all such objections my brother and i continued he though of different professions have in reality but one mind between us he has heard from me all the circumstances i know of you and they have interested him so much that he desires in plain english to be of any service he can to you this offer was made in earnest and if i had given him the largest salary that could have been offered by the most opulent of his pupils i could not have met with more attention or have been instructed with more zeal than i was by my new friend the special pleader he was also so kind as to put me at ease by the assurance that whenever i should begin to make money by my profession he would accept of remuneration he jestingly said that he would make the same bargain with me that was made by the famous sophist protagoras of old with his pupil that he should have the profits of the first cause i should wincertain that i would not like his treacherous pupil evathlus employ the rhetoricians arms against himself to cheat him out of his promised reward my special pleader was not a mere man of forms and law rigmaroles he knew the reason for the forms he used he had not only a technical but a rational knowledge of his business and what is still more uncommon he knew how to teach what he had learnt he did not merely set me down at a desk and leave me skins after skins of parchment to pore over in bewildered and hopeless stupidity he did not use me like a mere copying machine to copy sheet after sheet for him every morning from nine till four and again every evening from five till ten mine was a law tutor of a superior sort wherever he could he gave me a clue to guide me through the labyrinth and when no reason could be devised for what the law directs he never puzzled me by attempting to explain what could not be explained he did not insist upon the total surrender of my rational faculties but with wonderful liberality would allow me to call nonsense nonsense and would after two or three hours hard scrivening as the case might requirefor this i thank him more than all the restpermit me to yawn and stretch and pity myself and curse the useless repetitions of lawyers sinking under the weight of declarations and replications and double pleas and dilatory pleas of horse pleas traverses demurrers jeofails imparlances and errors averments bars and profestandoes o cecilia what pains did i endure to win your applause yet that i may state the whole truth let me acknowledge that even these my dullest hardest tasks were light compared with the burden i formerly bore of ennui at length my period of probation in my pleaders office was over i escaped from the dusky desk and the smell of musty parchments and the close smoky room i finished eating my terms at the temple and returned even as the captain of the packet swore in the face and teeth of the wind to dublin but in my haste to return i must not omit to notice for the sake of poetical equity that just when i was leaving england i heard that slow </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> slow but surepaced justice at last overtook that wretch crawley he was detected and convicted of embezzling considerable sums the property of a gentleman in cheshire who had employed him as his agent i saw him as i passed through chester going to prison amidst the execrations of the populace </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxii as i was not as formerly asleep in my carriage on deck when we came within sight of the irish shore i saw and hailed with delight the beautiful bay of dublin the moment we landed instead of putting myself out of humour as before with every thing at the marine hotel i went directly to my friend lord ys i made my sortie from the hotel with so much extraordinary promptitude that a slipshod waiter was forced to pursue me running or shuffling after me the whole length of the street before he could overtake me with a letter which had been waiting for my honour at the hotel since yesterdays holyhead packet this was a mistake as the letter had never come or gone by any holyhead packet it was only a letter from mr mleod to welcome me to ireland again and to tell me that he had taken care to secure good wellaired lodgings for me he added an account of what was going on at glenthorn castle the extravagance of my lady had by this time reduced the family to great difficulties for ready money as they could neither sell nor mortgage any part of the glenthorn estate which was settled on the son my poor fosterbrother had it seems in vain attempted to restrain the wasteful folly of his wife and to persuade johnny the young heirapparent to larn to be a jantleman in vain christy tried to prevail on his lordship to refrain drinking whisky preferably to claret the youth pleaded both his fathers and mothers examples and said that as he was an only son and his father had but a lifeinterest in the estate he expected to be indulged he repeated continually a short life and a merry one for me mr mleod concluded this letter by observing that far from its being a merry life he never saw any thing more sad than the life this foolish boy led and that glenthorn castle was so melancholy and disgusting a scene of waste riot and intemperance that he could not bear to go there i was grieved by this account for the sake of my poor fosterbrother but it would have made a deeper impression upon me at any other time i must own that i forgot the letter and all that it contained as i knocked at lord ys door lord y received me with open arms and with all the kindness of friendship anticipated the questions i longed yet feared to ask cecilia delamere is still unmarriedlet these words be enough to content you for the present all the rest is i hope in your own power in my powerdelightful thought yet how distant that hope for i was now after all my labours but just called to the bar not yet likely for years to make a guinea much less a fortune by my profession many of the greatest of our lawyers have gone circuit for ten or twelve years before they made a fashionable life hundred a year and i was at this time fourandthirty i confessed to my lord y that these reflections alarmed and depressed me exceedingly but he encouraged me by this answerperseveredeserve success and trust the rest not to fortune but to your friends it is not required of you to make ten thousand or one thousand a year at the bar in any given time but it is expected from you to give proofs that you are capable of conquering the indolence of your disposition or of your former habits it is required from you to give proofs of intellectual energy and ability when you have convinced me that you have the knowledge and assiduity that ought to succeed at the bar i shall be certain that only time is wanting to your actual acquisition of a fortune equal to what i ought to require for my fair friend and relation when it comes to that point it will my dear sir be time enough for me to say more till it comes to that point i have promised mrs delamere that you will not even attempt to see her daughter she blames me for having permitted cecilia and you to see so much of each other as you did in this house when you were last in ireland perhaps i was imprudent but your conduct </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> conduct has saved me from my own reproaches and i fear no other i end where i began with persevereand may the success your perseverance deserves be your reward if i recollect right these were nearly miss delameres own words at parting with you in truth i had not forgotten them and i was so much excited by their repetition at this moment and by my excellent friends encouraging voice that all difficulties all dread of future labours or evils vanished from my view i went my first circuit and made two guineas and was content for lord y was not disappointed he told me it would it must be so but though i made no money i obtained gradually amongst my associates at the bar the reputation for judgment and knowledge of this they could judge by my conversation and by the remarks on the trials brought on before us the elder counsel had been prepared in my favour first by mr devereux and afterwards by my diligence in following their advice during my studies in dublin they perceived that i had not lost my time in london and that my mind was in my possession they prophesied that from the moment i began to be employed i should rise rapidly opportunity they told me was now all that i wanted and for that i must wait with patience i waited with as much patience as i could i had many friends some among the judges some among a more powerful class of men the attorneys some of these friends made for me by mr devereux and lady geraldine some by lord y some may i say it by myself yet the utmost that even the highest patronage from the bench can do for a young barrister is to give him an opportunity of distinguishing himself in preference to other competitors this was all i hoped and i was not deceived in this hope it happened that a cause of considerable moment which had come on in our circuit and to the whole course of which i had attended with great care was removed by an appeal to dublin i fortunately i should say prudently was in the habit of constant attendance at the courts the counsel who was engaged to manage this cause was suddenly taken ill and was disabled from proceeding the judge called upon me the attorneys and the other counsel were all agreed in wishing me to take up the business for they knew i was prepared and competent to the question the next day the cause which was then to be finally decided came on i sat up all night to look over my documents and to make myself sure of my points ten years before this if any one had prophesied this of me how little could i have believed them the trial came oni rose to speak how fortunate it was for me that i did not know my lord y was in the court i am persuaded that i could not have uttered three sentences if he had caught my eye in the exordium of this my first harangue every man of sensibilityand no man without it can be an oratorevery man of sensibility knows that it is more difficult to speak in the presence of one anxious friend of whose judgment we have a high opinion than before a thousand auditors who are indifferent and are strangers to us not conscious who was listening to me whose eyes were upon me whose heart was beating for me i spoke with confidence and fluency for i spoke on a subject of which i had previously made myself completely master and i was so full of the matter that i thought not of the words perhaps this and my having the right side of the question were the causes of my success i heard a buzz of thanks and applause round me the decree was given in our favour at this moment i recollected my bargain and my debt to my good master the special pleader but all bargains all debts all special pleaders vanished the next instant from my mind for the crowd opened lord y appeared before me seized my hand congratulated me actually with tears of joy carried me away to his carriage ordered the coachman to drive homefast fast and now said he to me i am satisfied your trial is oversuccessfully overyou have convinced me of your powers and your perseverance all the hopes of friendship are fulfilled may all the hopes of love be accomplished you have now my free and full approbation to address my ward and relation cecilia delamere you </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> you will have difficulties with her mother perhaps but none beyond what we good and great lawyers shall i trust be able to overrule mrs delamere knows that as i have an unsettled estate and but one son i have it in my power to provide for her daughter as if she were my own it has always been my intention to do so but if you marry miss delamere you will still find it necessary to pursue your profession diligently to maintain her in her own rank and style of life and now that you have felt the pleasures of successful exertion you will consider this necessity as an additional blessing from what i have heard this day there can be no doubt that by pursuing your profession you can secure in a few years not only ease and competence but affluence and honourshonours of your own earning how far superior to any hereditary title the carriage stopped at lord ys door my friend presented me to cecilia whom i saw this day for the first time since my return to ireland from this hour i date the commencement of my life of real happiness how unlike that life of pleasure to which so many give erroneously the name of happiness lord y with his powerful influence supported my cause with mrs delamere who was induced though with an ill grace to give up her opposition cecilia she said was now threeandtwenty an age to judge for herself and lord ys judgment was a great point in favour of mr odonoghoe to be sure and no doubt mr odonoghoe might make a fortune since he had made a figure already at the bar in short she could not oppose the wishes of lord y and the affections of her daughter since they were so fixed but after all said mrs delamere what a horrid thing it will be to hear my girl called mrs odonoghoe only conceive the sound ofmrs odonoghoes carriage theremrs odonoghoes carriage stops the way your objection my dear madam replied lord y is fully as well founded as that of a young lady of my acquaintance who could not prevail on her delicacy to become the wife of a merchant of the name of sheepshanks he very wisely or very gallantly paid five hundred pounds to change his name i make no doubt that your future soninlaw will have no objection to take and bear the name and arms of delamere and i think i can answer for it that a kings letter may be obtained empowering him to do so with this part of the business allow me to charge myself i spare the reader the protracted journal of a lovers hopes and fears cecilia convinced by the exertions in which i had so long persevered that my affection for her was not only sincere and ardent but likely to be permanent did not torture me by the vain delays of female coquetry she believed she said that a man capable of conquering habitual indolence could not be of a feeble character and she therefore consented without hesitation to entrust her happiness to my care i hope my readers have by this time too favourable an opinion of me to suspect that in my joy i forgot him who had been my steady friend in adversity i wrote to mleod as soon as i knew my own happiness and assured him that it would be incomplete without his sympathy i do not think there was at our wedding a face of more sincere though sober joy than mleods cecilia and i have been now married above a twelvemonth and she permits me to say that she has never for a moment repented her choice that i have not relapsed into my former habits the judicious and benevolent reader will hence infer and yet i have been in a situation to be spoiled for i scarcely know a wish of my heart that remains ungratified except the wish that my friend mr devereux and lady geraldine should return from india to see and partake of that happiness of which they first prepared the foundation they first awakened my dormant intellects made me know that i had a heart and that i was capable of forming a character for myself the loss of my estate continued the course of my education forced me to exert my own powers and to rely upon myself my passion for the amiable and charming cecilia was afterwards motive sufficient to urge me to persevering intellectual labour fortunately my marriage has obliged me to continue my exertions and the labours of my profession have made the pleasures </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> pleasures of domestic life most delightful the rich says a philosophic moralist are obliged to labour if they would be healthy or happy and they call this labour exercise whether if i were again a rich man i should have sufficient voluntary exertion to take a due portion of mental and bodily exercise i dare not pretend to determine nor do i wish to be put to the trial desiring nothing in life but the continuance of the blessings i possess i may here conclude my memoirs by assuring my readers that after a full experience of most of what are called the pleasures of life i would not accept of all the glenthorn and sherwood estates to pass another year of such misery as i endured whilst i was stretched on the rack of a too easy chair the preceding memoirs were just ready for publication when i received the following letter honoured fosterbrother since the day i parted yees nothing in life but misfortins has happened me owing to my being overruled by my wife who would be a lady all i could say again it but thats over and theres no help for all and all that ever she can say will do no good the castles burnt down all to the ground and my johnnys dead and i wish i was dead in his place the occasion of his death was owing to drink which he fell into from getting too much money and nothing to doand a snuff of a candle when going to bed last night a little in liquor what does he do but takes the candle and sticks it up against the head of his bed as he used oftentimes to do without detriment in the cabin where he was reared against the mudwall but this was close to an ould window curtain and a deal of ould wood in the bed which was all in a smother and he lying asleep after drinking when he was ever hard to wake and before he waked at all it appears the unfortunit cratur was smothered and none heard a sentence of it till the ceiling of my room the blue bedchamber with a piece of the big wood cornice fell and wakened me with terrible uproar and all above and about me was flame and smoke and i just took my wife on my back and down the stairs with her which did not give in till five minutes after and she screeching and all them relations she had screeching and running every one for themselves and no thought in any to save any thing at all but just what they could for themselves and not a sarvant that was in his right rason i got the ladder with a deal of difficulty and up to johnnys room and there was a sight for mehe a corpse and how even to get the corpse out of that myself could not tell for i was bewildered and how they took me down i dont well know when i came to my sinses i was lying on the ground in the court and all confusion and screaming still and the flames raging worse than ever theres no use in describing allthe short of it is theres nothing remaining of the castle but the stones and its little id think o that if i could have johnny backsuch as he used to be in my good days since hes gone i am no good i write this to beg you being married of which i give you joy to miss delamere that is the hare at law will take possession of all immediately for i am as good as dead and will give no hindrance i will go back to my forge and by the help of god forget at my work what has passed and as to my wife she may go to her own kith and kin if she will not abide by me i shall not trouble her long mr mleod is a good man and will follow any directions you send and may the blessing of god attind and come to reign over us again when you will find me as heretofore your loyal fosterbrother christy donoghoe glenthorn castle is now rebuilding and when it is finished and when i return thither i will if it should be desired by the public give a faithful account of my feelings i flatter myself that i shall not relapse into indolence my understanding has been cultivatedi have acquired a taste for literature and the example of lord y convinces me that a man may at once be rich and noble </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> noble and active and happy footnotes 73 clodius albinus 74 i was not the nobleman who laid a wager that he could ride a fine horse to death in fifteen minutes indeed i must do myself the justice to say that i rejoiced at this mans losing his bet he blew the horse in four minutes and killed it but it did not die within the time prescribed by the bet 75 if any one should think it impossible that a man of lord glenthorns consequence should at the supposed moment of his death thus be neglected let them recollect the scenes that followed the death of tiberiusof henry the fourth of franceof william rufus and of george the second 76 for fostering i did never hear or read that it was in use or reputation in any country barbarous or civil as it hath been and yet is in ireland in the opinion of this people fostering hath always been a stronger alliance than blood and the fosterchildren do love and are beloved of their fosterfathers and their sept or clan more than of their natural parents and kindred and do participate of their means more frankly and do adhere unto them in all fortunes with more affection and constancy such a general custom in a kingdom in giving and taking children to foster making such a firm alliance as it doth in ireland was never seen or heard of in any other country of the world besidedavies see in lodges peerage of ireland an account of an irish nurse who went from kerry to france and from france to milan to see her fosterson the lord thomas fitzmaurice and to warn him that his estate was in danger from an heiratlaw who had taken possession of it in his absence the nurse being very old died on her return home 77 verbatim 78 since lord glenthorns memoirs were published the editor has received letters and information from the east west north and south of ireland on the present state of posting in that country the following is one of the many which is vouched by indisputable authority as a true and recent anecdote given in the very words in which it was related to the editor mr travelling in ireland having got into a hackney chaise was surprised to hear the driver knocking at each side of the carriage what are you doingant i nailing your honour
