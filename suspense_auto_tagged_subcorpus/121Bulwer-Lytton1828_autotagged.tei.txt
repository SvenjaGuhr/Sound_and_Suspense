<chapter>chapter i ou peuton etre mieux quau sein de sa famillefrench song where can on be better than in the bosom of ones family i am an only child my father was the younger son of one of our oldest earls my mother the dowerless daughter of a scotch peer mr pelham was a moderate whig and gave sumptuous dinners lady frances was a woman of taste and particularly fond of diamonds and old china vulgar people know nothing of the necessaries required in good society and the credit they give is as short as their pedigree six years after my birth there was an execution in our house my mother was just setting off on a visit to the duchess of d she declared it was impossible to go without her diamonds the chief of the bailiffs declared it was impossible to trust them out of his sight the matter was compromisedthe bailiff went with my mother to c and was introduced as my tutor a man of singular merit whispered my mother but so shy fortunately the bailiff was abashed and by losing his impudence he kept the secret at the end of the week the diamonds went to the jewellers and lady frances wore paste i think it was about a month afterwards that a sixteenth cousin left my mother twenty thousand pounds it will just pay off our most importunate creditors and equip me for melton said mr pelham it will just redeem my diamonds and refurnish the house said lady frances the latter alternative was chosen my father went down to run his last horse at newmarket and my mother received nine hundred people in a turkish tent both were equally fortunate the greek and the turk my fathers horse lost in consequence of which he pocketed five thousand pounds and my mother looked so charming as a sultana that seymour conway fell desperately in love with her mr conway had just caused two divorces and of course all the women in london were dying for himjudge then of the pride which lady frances felt at his addresses the end of the season was unusually dull and my mother after having looked over her list of engagements and ascertained that she had none remaining worth staying for agreed to elope with her new lover the carriage was at the end of the square my mother for the first time in her life got up at six oclock her foot was on the step and her hand next to mr conways heart when she remembered that her favourite china monster and her french dog were left behind she insisted on returningreentered the house and was coming down stairs with one under each arm when she was met by my father and two servants my fathers valet had discovered the flight i forget how and awakened his master when my father was convinced of his loss he called for his dressinggownsearched the garret and the kitchenlooked in the maids drawers and the cellaretand finally declared he was distracted i have heard that the servants were quite melted by his grief and i do not doubt it in the least for he was always celebrated for his skill in private theatricals he was just retiring to vent his grief in his dressingroom when he met my mother it must altogether have been an awkward rencontre and indeed for my father a remarkably unfortunate occurrence for seymour conway was immensely rich and the damages would no doubt have been proportionably high had they met each other alone the affair might easily have been settled and lady frances gone off in tranquillitythose dd servants are always in the way i have however often thought that it was better for me that the affair ended thusas i know from many instances that it is frequently exceedingly inconvenient to have ones mother divorced i have observed that the distinguishing trait of people accustomed to good society is a calm imperturbable quiet which pervades all their actions and habits from the greatest to the least they eat in quiet move in quiet live in quiet and lose their wife or even their money in quiet while low persons cannot take up either a spoon or an affront without making such an amazing noise about it to render this observation good and to return to the intended elopement nothing farther was said upon that event my father introduced conway to brookess and invited him to dinner twice a week for a whole twelvemonth not long after this occurrence by the death of my grandfather my uncle succeeded to the title and estates of the family he was as people justly observed rather an odd man built schools for peasants forgave poachers and diminished his farmers rents indeed on account of these and similar eccentricities he was thought a fool by some and a madman by others however he was not quite destitute of natural feeling for he paid my fathers debts and established us in the secure enjoyment of our former splendour but this piece of </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> of generosity or justice was done in the most unhandsome manner he obtained a promise from my father to retire from brookess and relinquish the turf and he prevailed upon my mother to take an aversion to diamonds and an indifference to china monsters </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ii tell arts they have no soundness but vary by esteeming tell schools they want profoundness and stand too much on seeming if arts and schools reply give arts and schools the liethe souls errand at ten years old i went to eton i had been educated till that period by my mother who being distantly related to lord who had published hints upon the culinary art imagined she possessed an hereditary claim to literary distinction history was her great forte for she had read all the historical romances of the day and history accordingly i had been carefully taught i think at this moment i see my mother before me reclining on her sofa and repeating to me some story about queen elizabeth and lord essex then telling me in a languid voice as she sank back with the exertion of the blessings of a literary taste and admonishing me never to read above half an hour at a time for fear of losing my health well to eton i went and the second day i had been there i was half killed for refusing with all the pride of a pelham to wash teacups i was rescued from the clutches of my tyrant by a boy not much bigger than myself but reckoned the best fighter for his size in the whole school his name was reginald glanville from that period we became inseparable and our friendship lasted all the time he stayed at eton which was within a year of my own departure for cambridge his father was a baronet of a very ancient and wealthy family and his mother was a woman of some talent and more ambition she made her house one of the most recherchee in london seldom seen at large assemblies she was eagerly sought after in the well winnowed soirees of the elect her wealth great as it was seemed the least prominent ingredient of her establishment there was in it no uncalled for ostentationno purseproud vulgarityno cringing to great and no patronizing condescension to little people even the sunday newspapers could not find fault with her and the querulous wives of younger brothers could only sneer and be silent it is an excellent connexion said my mother when i told her of my friendship with reginald glanville and will be of more use to you than many of greater apparent consequence remember my dear that in all the friends you make at present you look to the advantage you can derive from them hereafter that is what we call knowledge of the world and it is to get the knowledge of the world that you are sent to a public school i think however to my shame that notwithstanding my mothers instructions very few prudential considerations were mingled with my friendship for reginald glanville i loved him with a warmth of attachment which has since surprised even myself he was of a very singular character he used to wander by the river in the bright days of summer when all else were at play without any companion but his own thoughts and these were tinged even at that early age with a deep and impassioned melancholy he was so reserved in his manner that it was looked upon as coldness or pride and was repaid as such by a pretty general dislike yet to those he loved no one could be more open and warm more watchful to gratify others more indifferent to gratification for himself an utter absence of all selfishness and an eager and active benevolence were indeed the distinguishing traits of his character i have seen him endure with a careless goodnature the most provoking affronts from boys much less than himself but directly i or any other of his immediate friends was injured or aggrieved his anger was almost implacable although he was of a slight frame yet early exercise had brought strength to his muscles and activity to his limbs and his skill in all athletic exercises whenever which was but rarely he deigned to share them gave alike confidence and success to whatever enterprise his lionlike courage tempted him to dare such briefly and imperfectly sketched was the character of reginald glanvillethe one who of all my early companions differed the most from myself yet the one whom i loved the most and the one whose future destiny was the most intertwined with my own i was in the head class when i left eton as i was reckoned an uncommonly welleducated boy it may not be ungratifying to the admirers of the present system of education to pause here for a moment and recal what i then knew i could make twenty latin verses in half an hour i could construe without an english translation all the easy latin authors and many of the difficult ones with it i could read greek fluently and even translate it though the medium of a latin version at the bottom of the page i was thought exceedingly clever for i had only been eight years acquiring all this fund of information which as one can never recal it in the world you have every right to suppose that i had entirely forgotten before i was five and twenty as i was never taught a syllable of english during this period as when i once attempted to read popes poems out of school hours i was laughed at and called a sap as my mother when i went to school renounced her own instructions and as whatever schoolmasters may think to the contrary one learns nothing nowadays by inspiration so of everything which relates to english literature english laws and english history with the exception of the said story of queen elizabeth and lord essex you have the same right to suppose that i was at the age of eighteen when i left eton in the profoundest ignorance at this age i was transplanted to cambridge where i bloomed for two years in the blue and silver of a fellow commoner of trinity at the end of that time being of royal descent i became entitled to an honorary degree i suppose the term is in contradistinction to an honourable degree which is obtained by pale men in spectacles and cotton stockings after thirtysix months of intense application i do not exactly remember how i spent my time at cambridge i had a pianoforte in my room and a private billiardroom at a village two miles off and between these resources i managed to improve my mind more than could reasonably have been expected to say truth the whole place reeked with vulgarity the men drank beer by the gallon and eat cheese by the hundred weightwore jockeycut coats and talked slangrode for wagers and swore when they lostsmoked in your face and expectorated on the floor their proudest glory was to drive the mailtheir mightiest exploit to box with the coachmantheir most delicate amour to leer at the barmaid it will be believed that i felt little regret in quitting companions of this description i went to take leave of our college tutor mr pelham said he affectionately squeezing me by the hand your conduct has been most exemplary you have not walked wantonly over the college grassplats nor set your dog at the proctornor driven tandems by day nor broken lamps by nightnor entered the chapel in order to display your intoxicationnor the lectureroom in order to caricature the professors this is the general behaviour of young men of family and fortune but it has not been yours sir you have been an honour to your college thus closed my academical career he who does not allow that it passed creditably to my teachers profitably to myself and beneficially to the world is a narrowminded and illiterate man who knows nothing of the advantages of modern education </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iii thus does a false ambition rule us thus pomp delude and folly fool us shenstone an open house haunted with great resortbishop halls satires i left cambridge in a very weak state of health and as nobody had yet come to london i accepted the invitation of sir lionel garrett to pay him a visit at his country seat accordingly one raw winters day full of the hopes of the reviving influence of air and exercise i found myself carefully packed up in three great coats and on the high road to garrett park sir lionel garrett was a character very common in england and in describing him i describe the whole species he was of an ancient family and his ancestors had for centuries resided on their estates in norfolk sir lionel who came to his majority and his fortune at the same time went up to london at the age of twentyone a raw uncouth sort of young man in a green coat and lank hair his friends in town were of that set whose members are above ton whenever they do not grasp at its possession but who whenever they do lose at once their aim and their equilibrium and fall immeasurably below it i mean that set which i call the respectable consisting of old peers of an old school country gentlemen who still disdain not to love their wine and to hate the french generals who have served in the army elder brothers who succeed to something besides a mortgage and younger brothers who do not mistake their capital for their income to this set you may add the whole of the baronetagefor i have remarked that baronets hang together like bees or scotchmen and if i go to a baronets house and speak to some one whom i have not the happiness to know i always say sir john it was no wonder then that to this set belonged sir lionel garrettno more the youth in a green coat and lank hair but pinched in and curled outabounding in horses and whiskersdancing all nightlounging all daythe favourite of the old ladies </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> ladies the philander of the young one unfortunate evening sir lionel garrett was introduced to the celebrated duchess of d from that moment his head was turned before then he had always imagined that he was somebodythat he was sir lionel garrett with a goodlooking person and eight thousand ayear he now knew that he was nobody unless he went to lady gs and unless he bowed to lady s disdaining all importance derived from himself it became absolutely necessary to his happiness that all his importance should be derived solely from his acquaintance with others he cared not a straw that he was a man of fortune of family of consequence he must be a man of ton or he was an atom a nonentity a very worm and no man no lawyer at grays inn no galley slave at the oar ever worked so hard at his task as sir lionel garrett at his ton to a single man is a thing attainable enough sir lionel was just gaining the envied distinction when he saw courted and married lady harriett woodstock his new wife was of a modern and not very rich family and striving like sir lionel for the notoriety of fashion but of this struggle he was ignorant he saw her admitted into good societyhe imagined she commanded it she was a hanger onhe believed she was a leader lady harriett was crafty and twentyfourhad no objection to be married nor to change the name of woodstock for garrett she kept up the baronets mistake till it was too late to repair it marriage did not bring sir lionel wisdom his wife was of the same turn of mind as himself they might have been great people in the countrythey preferred being little people in town they might have chosen friends among persons of respectability and rankthey preferred being chosen as acquaintance by persons of ton society was their beings end and aim and the only thing which brought them pleasure was the pain of attaining it did i not say truly that i would describe individuals of a common species is there one who reads this who does not recognize that overflowing class of the english population whose members would conceive it an insult to be thought of sufficient rank to be respectable for what they arewho take it as an honour that they are made by their acquaintancewho renounce the ease of living for themselves for the trouble of living for persons who care not a pin for their existencewho are wretched if they are not dictated to by othersand who toil groan travail through the whole course of life in order to forfeit their independence i arrived at garrett park just time enough to dress for dinner as i was descending the stairs after having performed that ceremony i heard my own name pronounced by a very soft lisping voice henry pelham dear what a pretty name is he handsome rather distingue than handsome was the unsatisfactory reply couched in a slow pompous accent which i immediately recognized to belong to lady harriett garrett can we make something of him resumed the first voice something said lady harriett indignantly he will be lord glenmorris and he is son to lady frances pelham ah said the lisper carelessly but can he write poetry and play proverbes no lady harriett said i advancing but permit me through you to assure lady nelthorpe that he can admire those who do so you know me then said the lisper i see we shall be excellent friends and disengaging herself from lady harriett she took my arm and began discussing persons and things poetry and china french plays and music till i found myself beside her at dinner and most assiduously endeavouring to silence her by the superior engrossments of a bechamelle de poisson i took the opportunity of the pause to survey the little circle of which lady harriett was the centre in the first place there was mr davison a great political economist a short dark corpulent gentleman with a quiet serene sleepy countenance which put me exceedingly in mind of my grandmothers armchair beside him was a quick sharp little woman all sparkle and bustle glancing a small grey prying eye round the table with a most restless activity this as lady nelthorpe afterwards informed me was a miss trafford an excellent person for a christmas in the country whom every body was dying to have she was an admirable mimic an admirable actress and an admirable reciter made poetry and shoes and told fortunes by the cards which came actually true there was also mr wormwood the nolimetangere of literary lionsan author who sowed his conversation not with flowers but thorns nobody could accuse him of the flattery generally imputed to his species through the course of a long and varied life he had never once been known to say a civil thing he was too much disliked not to be recherche whatever is once notorious even for being disagreeable is sure to be courted in england opposite to him sat the really clever and affectedly pedantic lord vincent one of those persons who have been promising young men all their lives who are found till four oclock in the afternoon in a dressinggown with a quarto before them who go down into the country for six weeks every session to cram an impromptu reply and who always have a work in the press which is never to be published lady nelthorpe herself i had frequently seen she had some reputation for talent was exceedingly affected wrote poetry in albums ridiculed her husband who was a fox hunter and had a great penchant pour les beaux arts et les beaux hommes there were four or five others of the unknown vulgar younger brothers who were good shots and bad matches elderly ladies who lived in bakerstreet and liked long whist and young ones who never took wine and said sir i must however among this number except the beautiful lady roseville the most fascinating woman perhaps of the day she was evidently the great person there and indeed among all people who paid due deference to ton was always sure to be so every where i have never seen but one person more beautiful her eyes were of the deepest blue her complexion of the most delicate carnation her hair of the richest auburn nor could even mr wormwood detect the smallest fault in the rounded yet slender symmetry of her figure although not above twentyfive she was in that state in which alone a woman ceases to be a dependantwidowhood lord roseville who had been dead about two years had not survived their marriage many months that period was however sufficiently long to allow him to appreciate her excellence and to testify his sense of it the whole of his unentailed property which was very large he bequeathed to her she was very fond of the society of literati though without the pretence of belonging to their order but her manners constituted her chief attraction while they were utterly different from those of every one else you could not in the least minutiae discover in what the difference consisted this is in my opinion the real test of perfect breeding while you are enchanted with the effect it should possess so little prominency and peculiarity that you should never be able to guess the cause pray said lord vincent to mr wormwood have you been to pthis year no was the answer i have my lord said miss trafford who never lost an opportunity of slipping in a word well and did they make you sleep as usual at the crown with the same eternal excuse after having brought you fifty miles from town of small houseno bedsall engagedinn close by ah never shall i forget that inn with its royal name and its hard beds uneasy sleeps a head beneath the crown ha ha excellent cried miss trafford who was always the first in at the death of a pun yes indeed they did poor old lord belton with his rheumatism and that immense general grant with his asthma together with three single men and myself were safely conveyed to that asylum for the destitute ah grant grant said lord vincent eagerly who saw another opportunity of whipping in a pun he slept there also the same night i did and when i saw his unwieldy person waddling out of the door the next morning i said to temple well thats the largest grant i ever saw from the crown note it was from mr j smith that lord vincent purloined this pun very good said wormwood gravely i declare vincent you are growing quite witty do you remember jekyl poor fellow what a really good punster he wasnot agreeable thoughparticularly at dinnerno punsters are mr davison what is that dish next to you mr davison was a great gourmand salmi de perdreaux aux truffes replied the political economist truffles said wormwood have you been eating any yes said davison with unusual energy and they are the best i have tasted for a long time very likely said wormwood with a dejected air i am particularly fond of them but i dare not touch onetruffles are so very apoplecticyou i make no doubt may eat them in safety wormwood was a tall meagre man with a neck a yard long davison was as i have said short and fat and made without any apparent neck at allonly head and shoulders like a codfish poor mr davison turned perfectly white he fidgeted about in his chair cast a look of the most deadly fear and aversion at the fatal dish he had been so attentive to before and muttering apoplectic closed his lips and did not open them again all dinnertime mr wormwoods object was effected two people were silenced and uncomfortable and a sort of mist hung over the spirits of the whole party the dinner went on and off like all other dinners the ladies retired and the men drank and talked indecorums mr davison left the room first in order to look out the word truffle in the encyclopaedia and lord vincent and i went </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> went next lest as my companion characteristically observed that dd wormwood should if we stayed a moment longer send us weeping to our beds </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iv oh la belle chose que la postelettres de sevigne aybut who is itas you like it i had mentioned to my mother my intended visit to garrett park and the second day after my arrival there came the following letter my dear henry i was very glad to hear you were rather better than you had been i trust you will take great care of yourself i think flannel waistcoats might be advisable and bytheby they are very good for the complexion apropos of the complexion i did not like that green coat you wore when i last saw youyou look best in blackwhich is a great compliment for people must be very distingue in appearance in order to do so you know my dear that those garretts are in themselves any thing but unexceptionable you will therefore take care not to be too intimate it is however a very good house all you meet there are worth knowing for one thing or the other remember henry that the acquaintance not the friends of second or thirdrate people are always sure to be good they are not independent enough to receive whom they liketheir whole rank is in their guests you may be also sure that the menage will in outward appearance at least be quite comme il faut and for the same reason gain as much knowledge de lart culinaire as you can it is an accomplishment absolutely necessary you may also pick up a little acquaintance with metaphysics if you have any opportunity that sort of thing is a good deal talked about just at present i hear lady roseville is at garrett park you must be particularly attentive to her you will probably now have an opportunity de faire votre cour that may never again happen in london she is so much surrounded by all that she is quite inaccessible to one besides there you will have so many rivals without flattery to you i take it for granted that you are the best looking and most agreeable person at garrett park and it will therefore be a most unpardonable fault if you do not make lady roseville of the same opinion nothing my dear son is like a liaison quite innocent of course with a woman of celebrity in the world in marriage a man lowers a woman to his own rank in an affaire du coeur he raises himself to hers i need not i am sure after what i have said press this point any further write to me and inform me of all your proceedings if you mention the people who are at garrett park i can tell you the proper line of conduct to pursue with each i am sure that i need not add that i have nothing but your real good at heart and that i am your very affectionate mother frances pelham ps never talk much to young menremember that it is the women who make a reputation in society well said i when i had read this letter and adjusted my best curl my mother is very right and so now for lady roseville i went down stairs to breakfast miss trafford and lady nelthorpe were in the room talking with great interest and on miss traffords part with still greater vehemence so handsome said lady nelthorpe as i approached are you talking of me said i oh you vanity of vanities was the answer no we were speaking of a very romantic adventure which has happened to miss trafford and myself and disputing about the hero of it miss trafford declares he is frightful i say that he is beautiful now you know mr pelham as to you there can interrupted i be but one opinionbut the adventure is this cried miss trafford in a great fright lest lady nelthorpe should by speaking first have the pleasure of the narrationwe were walking two or three days ago by the seaside picking up shells and talking about the corsair when a large fierce man interrupted i no dog renewed miss trafford flew suddenly out of a cave under a rock and began growling at dear lady nelthorpe and me in the most savage manner imaginable he would certainly have torn us to pieces if a very tall not so very tall either said lady nelthorpe dear how you interrupt one said miss trafford pettishly well a very short man then wrapped up in a cloak in a great coat drawled lady nelthorpe miss trafford went on without noticing the emendationhad not with incredible rapidity sprung down the rock and called him off said lady nelthorpe yes called him off pursued miss trafford looking round for the necessary symptoms of our wonder at this very extraordinary incident what is the most remarkable said lady nelthorpe is that though he seemed from his dress and appearance to be really a gentleman he never stayed to ask if we were alarmed or hurtscarcely even looked at us i dont wonder at that said mr wormwood who with lord vincent had just entered the roomand vanished among the rocks as suddenly as he had appeared oh youve seen that fellow have you said lord vincent so have i and a devilish queer looking person he is the balls of his broad eyes rolld in his head and glard betwixt a yellow and a red he looked a lion with a gloomy stare and oer his eyebrows hung his matted hair well remembered and better appliedeh mr pelham really said i i am not able to judge of the application since i have not seen the hero oh its admirable said miss trafford just the description i should have given of him in prose but pray where when and how did you see him your question is religiously mysterious tria juncta in uno replied vincent but i will answer it with the simplicity of a quaker the other evening i was coming home from one of sir lionels preserves and had sent the keeper on before in order more undisturbedly to con witticisms for dinner said wormwood to make out the meaning of mr wormwoods last work continued lord vincent my shortest way lay through that churchyard about a mile hence which is such a lion in this ugly part of the country because it has three thistles and a tree just as i got there i saw a man suddenly rise from the earth where he appeared to have been lying he stood still for a moment and then evidently not perceiving me raised his clasped hands to heaven and muttered some words i was not able distinctly to hear as i approached nearer to him which i did with no very pleasant sensations a large black dog which till then had remained couchant sprung towards me with a loud growl sonat hic de nare canina litera as persius has it i was too terrified to move obstupuisteteruntque comae and i should most infallibly have been converted into dogs meat if our mutual acquaintance had not started from his reverie called his dog by the very appropriate name of terror and then slouching his hat over his face passed rapidly by me dog and all i did not recover the fright for an hour and a quarter i walkedye gods how i did walkno wonder by the by that i mended my pace for as pliny says truly timor est emendator asperrimus mr wormwood had been very impatient during this recital preparing an attack upon lord vincent when mr davison entering suddenly diverted the assault good god said wormwood dropping his roll how very ill you look today mr davison face flushedveins swelledoh those horrid truffles miss trafford ill trouble you for the salt </chapter>

<chapter>chapter v be she fairer than the day or the flowery meads in may if she be not so to me what care i how fair she begeorge withers it was a great pity so it was that villainous saltpetre should be digged out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyedfirst part of king henry iv several days passed i had taken particular pains to ingratiate myself with lady roseville and so far as common acquaintance went i had no reason to be dissatisfied with my success any thing else i soon discovered notwithstanding my vanity which made no inconsiderable part in the composition of henry pelham was quite out of the question her mind was wholly of a different mould from my own she was like a being not perhaps of a better but of another world than myself we had not one thought or opinion in common we looked upon things with a totally different vision i was soon convinced that she was of a nature exactly contrary to what was generally believedshe was any thing but the mere mechanical woman of the world she possessed great sensibility and even romance of temper strong passions and still stronger imagination but over all these deeper recesses of her character the extreme softness and languor of her manners threw a veil which no superficial observer could penetrate there were times when i could believe that she was inwardly restless and unhappy but she was too well versed in the arts of concealment to suffer such an appearance to be more than momentary i must own that i consoled myself very easily for my want in this particular instance of that usual good fortune which attends me aupres des dames the fact was that i had another object in pursuit all the men at sir lionel garretts were keen sportsmen now shooting is an amusement i was never particularly partial to i was first disgusted with that species of rational recreation at a battue where instead of bagging anything i was nearly bagged having been inserted like wine in an ice pail in a wet ditch for three hours during which time my hat had been twice shot at for a pheasant and my leather gaiters once for a hare and to crown all when these several mistakes were discovered </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> discovered my intended exterminators instead of apologizing for having shot at me were quite disappointed at having missed seriously that same shooting is a most barbarous amusement only fit for majors in the army and royal dukes and that sort of people the mere walking is bad enough but embarrassing ones arms moreover with a gun and ones legs with turnip tops exposing oneself to the mercy of bad shots and the atrocity of good seems to me only a state of painful fatigue enlivened by the probability of being killed this digression is meant to signify that i never joined the single men and double mantons that went in and off among sir lionel garretts preserves i used instead to take long walks by myself and found like virtue my own reward in the additional health and strength these diurnal exertions produced me one morning chance threw into my way une bonne fortune which i took care to improve from that time the family of a farmer sinclair one of sir lionels tenants was alarmed by strange and supernatural noises one apartment in especial occupied by a female member of the household was allowed even by the clerk of the parish a very bold man and a bit of a sceptic to be haunted the windows of that chamber were wont to open and shut thin airy voices confabulate therein and dark shapes hover thereout long after the fair occupant had with the rest of the family retired to repose but the most unaccountable thing was the fatality which attended me and seemed to mark me out nolens volens for an untimely death i who had so carefully kept out of the way of gunpowder as a sportsman very narrowly escaped being twice shot as a ghost this was but a poor reward for a walk more than a mile long in nights by no means of cloudless climes and starry skies accordingly i resolved to give up the ghost in earnest rather than in metaphor and to pay my last visit and adieus to the mansion of farmer sinclair the night on which i executed this resolve was rather memorable in my future history the rain had fallen so heavily during the day as to render the road to the house almost impassable and when it was time to leave i inquired with very considerable emotion whether there was not an easier way to return the answer was satisfactory and my last nocturnal visit at farmer sinclairs concluded </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vi why sleeps he not when others are at restbyron according to the explanation i had received the road i was now to pursue was somewhat longer but much better than that which i generally took it was to lead me home through the churchyard of the same by the by which lord vincent had particularized in his anecdote of the mysterious stranger the night was clear but windy there were a few light clouds passing rapidly over the moon which was at her full and shone through the frosty air with all that cold and transparent brightness so peculiar to our northern winters i walked briskly on till i came to the churchyard i could not then help pausing notwithstanding my total deficiency in all romance to look for a few moments at the exceeding beauty of the scene around me the church itself was extremely old and stood alone and grey in the rude simplicity of the earliest form of gothic architecture two large dark yewtrees drooped on each side over tombs which from their size and decorations appeared to be the last possession of some quondam lords of the soil to the left the ground was skirted by a thick and luxuriant copse of evergreens in the front of which stood one tall naked oak stern and leafless a very token of desolation and decay there were but few grave stones scattered about and these were for the most part hidden by the long wild grass which wreathed and climbed round them over all the blue skies and still moon shed that solemn light the effect of which either on the scene or the feelings it is so impossible to describe i was just about to renew my walk when a tall dark figure wrapped up like myself in a large french cloak passed slowly along from the other side of the church and paused by the copse i have before mentioned i was shrouded at that moment from his sight by one of the yew trees he stood still only for a few moments he then flung himself upon the earth and sobbed audibly even at the spot where i was standing i was in doubt whether to wait longer or to proceed my way lay just by him and it might be dangerous to interrupt so substantial an apparition however my curiosity was excited and my feet were half frozen two cogent reasons for proceeding and to say truth i was never very much frightened by any thing dead or alive accordingly i left my obscurity and walked slowly onwards i had not got above three paces before the figure rose and stood erect and motionless before me his hat had fallen off and the moon shone full upon his countenance it was not the wild expression of intense anguish which dwelt on those hueless and sunken features nor their quick change to ferocity and defiance as his eyes fell upon me which made me start back and feel my heart stand still notwithstanding the fearful ravages graven in that countenance then so brilliant with the graces of boyhood i recognized at one glance those still noble and chiselled features it was reginald glanville who stood before me i recovered myself instantly i threw myself towards him and called him by his name he turned hastily but i would not suffer him to escape i put my hand upon his arm and drew him towards me glanville i exclaimed it is i it is your oldold friend henry pelham good god have i met you at last and in such a scene glanville shook me from him in an instant covered his face with his hands and sunk down with one wild cry which went fearfully through that still place upon the spot from which he had but just risen i knelt beside him i took his hand i spoke to him in every endearing term that i could think of and roused and excited as my feelings were by so strange and sudden a meeting i felt my tears involuntarily falling over the hand which i held in my own glanville turned he looked at me for one moment as if fully to recognize me and then throwing himself in my arms wept like a child it was but for a few minutes that this weakness lasted he rose suddenlythe whole expression of his countenance was changedthe tears still rolled in large drops down his cheeks but the proud stern character which the features had assumed seemed to deny the feelings which that feminine weakness had betrayed pelham he said you have seen me thus i had hoped that no living eye wouldthis is the last time in which i shall indulge this folly god bless youwe shall meet againand this night shall then seem to you like a dream i would have answered but he turned swiftly passed in one moment through the copse and in the next had utterly disappeared </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vii you reach a chilling chamber where you dread dampscrabbes borough i could not sleep the whole of that night and the next morning i set off early with the resolution of discovering where glanville had taken up his abode it was evident from his having been so frequently seen that it must be in the immediate neighbourhood i went first to farmer sinclairs they had often remarked him but could give me no other information i then proceeded towards the coast there was a small public house belonging to sir lionel close by the sea shore never had i seen a more bleak and dreary prospect than that which stretched for miles around this miserable cabaret how an innkeeper could live there is a mystery to me at this dayi should have imagined it a spot upon which anything but a seagull or a scotchman would have starved just the sort of place however thought i to hear something of glanville i went into the house i inquired and heard that a strange gentleman had been lodging for the last two or three weeks at a cottage about a mile further up the coast thither i bent my steps and after having met two crows and one officer on the preventive service i arrived safely at my new destination it was a house very little better in outward appearance than the wretched but i had just left for i observe in all situations and in all houses that the public is not too well served the situation was equally lonely and desolate the house which belonged to an individual half fisherman and half smuggler stood in a sort of bay between two tall rugged black cliffs before the door hung various nets to dry beneath the genial warmth of a winters sun and a broken boat with its keel uppermost furnished an admirable habitation for a hen and her family who appeared to receive en pension an old clericobachelorlooking raven i cast a suspicious glance at the lastmentioned personage which hopped towards me with a very hostile appearance and entered the threshold with a more rapid step in consequence of sundry apprehensions of a premeditated assault i understand said i to an old dried brown female who looked like a resuscitated redherring that a gentleman is lodging here no sir was the answer he left us this morning the reply came upon me like a shower bath i was both chilled and stunned by so unexpected a shock the old woman on my renewing my inquiries took me up stairs to a small wretched room to which the damps literally clung in one corner was a flockbed still unmade and opposite to it a threelegged stool a chair and an antique carved oak table </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> table a donation perhaps from some squire in the neighbourhood on this last were scattered fragments of writing paper a cracked cup half full of ink a pen and a broken ramrod as i mechanically took up the latter the woman said in a charming patois which i shall translate since i cannot do justice to the original the gentleman sir said he came here for a few weeks to shoot he brought a gun a large dog and a small portmanteau he used to spend all the mornings in the fens though he must have been but a poor shot for he seldom brought home anything and we fear sir that he was rather out of his mind for he used to go out alone at night and stay sometimes till morning however he was quite quiet and behaved to us like a gentleman so it was no business of ours only my husband does think pray interrupted i why did he leave you so suddenly lord sir i dont know but he told us for several days past that he should not stay over the week and so we were not surprised when he left us this morning at seven oclock poor gentleman my heart bled for him when i saw him look so pale and ill and here i did see the good womans eyes fill with tears but she wiped them away and took advantage of the additional persuasion they gave to her natural whine to say if sir you know of any young gentleman who likes fenshooting and wants a nice pretty quiet apartment i will certainly recommend this said i you see it at present rejoined the landlady quite in a litter like but it is really a sweet place in summer charming said i with a cold shiver hurrying down the stairs with a pain in my ear and the rheumatism in my shoulder and this thought i was glanvilles residence for nearly a month i wonder he did not exhale into a vapour or moisten into a green damp i went home by the churchyard i paused on the spot where i had last seen him a small gravestone rose over the mound of earth on which he had thrown himself it was perfectly simple the date of the year and month which showed that many weeks had not elapsed since the death of the deceased and the initials g d were all that was engraved upon the stone beside this tomb was one of a more pompous description to the memory of a mrs douglas which had with the simple tumulus nothing in common unless the initial letter of the surname corresponding with the latter initial on the neighbouring gravestone might authorize any connection between them not supported by that similitude of style usually found in the cenotaphs of the same family the one indeed might have covered the grave of a humble villagerthe other the restingplace of the lady of the manor i found therefore no clue for the labyrinth of surmise and i went home more vexed and disappointed with my days expedition than i liked to acknowledge to myself lord vincent met me in the hall delighted to see you said he i have just been to the nearest town in order to discover what sort of savages abide there great preparations for a ballall the tallow candles in the town are bespokenand i heard a most uncivilized fiddle twang short and sharp like the shrill swallows cry the one milliners shop was full of fat squiresses buying muslin ammunition to make the ball go off and the attics even at four oclock were thronged with rubicund damsels who were already as shakspeare says of waves in a storm curling their monstrous heads </chapter>

<chapter>chapter viii jusquau revoir le ciel vous tienne tous en joiemoliere i was now pretty well tried of garrett park lady roseville was going to htd where i also had an invitation lord vincent meditated an excursion to paris mr davison had already departed miss trafford had been gone god knows how long and i was not at all disposed to be left like the last rose of summer in single blessedness at garrett park vincent wormwood and myself all agreed to leave on the same day the morning of our departure arrived we sat down to breakfast as usual lord vincents carriage was at the door his groom was walking about his favourite saddle horse a beautiful mare that is of yours said i carelessly looking at it and reaching across the table to help myself to the pate de foie gras mare exclaimed the incorrigible punster delighted with my mistake i thought that you would have been better acquainted with your propria quoe maribus humph said wormwood when i look at you i am always at least reminded of the as in praoesenti lord vincent drew up and looked unutterable anger wormwood went on with his dry toast and lady roseville who that morning had for a wonder come down to breakfast good naturedly took off the bear whether or not his ascetic nature was somewhat mollified by the soft smiles and softer voice of the beautiful countess i cannot pretend to say but he certainly entered into a conversation with her not much rougher than that of a less gifted individual might have been they talked of literature lord byron converzaziones and lydia white note written before the death of that lady miss white said lady roseville has not only the best command of language herself but she gives language to other people dinner parties usually so stupid are at her house quite delightful i have actually seen english people look happy and one or two even almost natural ah said wormwood that is indeed rare with us every thing is assumption we are still exactly like the english suitor to portia in the merchant of venice we take our doublet from one country our hose from another and our behaviour every where fashion with us is like the man in one of le sages novels who was constantly changing his servants and yet had but one suit of livery which every new comer whether he was tall or short fat or thin was obliged to wear we adopt manners however incongruous and ill suited to our nature and thus we always seem awkward and constrained but lydia whites soirees are indeed agreeable i remember the last time i dined there we were six in number and though we were not blessed with the company of lord vincent the conversation was without let or flaw every one even s said good things indeed cried lord vincent and pray mr wormwood what did you say why answered the poet glancing with a significant sneer over vincents somewhat inelegant person i thought of your lordships figure and saidgrace hemhemgratia malorum tam infida est quam ipsi as pliny says muttered lord vincent getting up hastily and buttoning his coat i took the opportunity of the ensuing pause to approach lady roseville and whisper my adieus she was kind and even warm to me in returning them and pressed me with something marvellously like sincerity to be sure to come and see her directly she returned to london i soon discharged the duties of my remaining farewells and in less than half an hour was more than a mile distant from garrett park and its inhabitants i cant say that for one who like me is fond of being made a great deal of that there is any thing very delightful in those visits into the country it may be all well enough for married people who from the mere fact of being married are always entitled to certain consideration putpar exempleinto a bedroom a little larger than a dog kennel and accommodated with a lookingglass that does not distort ones features like a paralytic stroke but we single men suffer a plurality of evils and hardships in entrusting ourselves to the casualties of rural hospitality we are thrust up into any attic repositoryexposed to the mercy of rats and the incursions of swallows our lavations are performed in a cracked basin and we are so far removed from human assistance that our very bells sink into silence before they reach half way down the stairs but two days before i left garrett park i myself saw an enormous mouse run away with my almond paste without any possible means of resisting the aggression oh the hardships of a single man are beyond conception and what is worse the very misfortune of being single deprives one of all sympathy a single man can do this and a single man ought to do that and a single man may be put here and a single man may be sent there are maxims that i have been in the habit of hearing constantly inculcated and never disputed during my whole life and so from our fare and treatment being coarse in all matters they have at last grown to be all matters in course </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ix therefore to francehenry iv i was rejoiced to find myself again in london i went to my fathers house in grosvenorsquare all the family viz he and my mother were down at htd and malgre my aversion to the country i thought i might venture as far as lady ss for a couple of days accordingly to htd i went that is really a noble housesuch a hallsuch a gallery i found my mother in the drawingroom admiring the picture of his late majesty she was leaning on the arm of a tall fair young man henry said she introducing me to him do you remember your old schoolfellow lord george clinton perfectly said i though i remembered nothing about him and we shook hands in the most cordial manner imaginable by the way there is no greater bore than being called upon to recollect men with whom one had been at school some ten years back in the first place if they were not in ones own set one most likely scarcely knew them to speak to and in the second place if they were in ones own set they are sure to be entirely opposite </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> opposite to the nature we have since acquired for i scarcely ever knew an instance of the companions of ones boyhood being agreeable to the tastes of ones manhood a strong proof of the folly of common people who send their sons to eton and harrow to form connections clinton was on the eve of setting out upon his travels his intention was to stay a year at paris and he was full of the blissful expectations the idea of that city had conjured up we remained together all the evening and took a prodigious fancy to one another long before i went to bed he had perfectly inoculated me with his own ardour for continental adventures and indeed i had half promised to accompany him my mother when i first told her of my travelling intentions was in despair but by degrees she grew reconciled to the idea your health will improve by a purer air said she and your pronunciation of french is at present any thing but correct take care of yourself therefore my dear son and pray lose no time in engaging coulon as your maitre de danse my father gave me his blessing and a check on his banker within three days i had arranged every thing with clinton and on the fourth i returned with him to london from thence we set off to doverembarkeddined for the first time in our lives on french groundwere astonished to find so little difference between the two countries and still more so at hearing even the little children talk french so well note see addisons travels for this ideaproceeded to abbevillethere poor clinton fell ill for several days we were delayed in that abominable town and then clinton by the advice of the doctors returned to england i went back with him as far as dover and then impatient at my loss of time took no rest night or day till i found myself at paris young wellborn tolerably goodlooking and never utterly destitute of money nor grudging whatever enjoyment it could produce i entered paris with the ability and the resolution to make the best of those beaux jours which so rapidly glide from our possession </chapter>

<chapter>chapter x seest thou how gayly my young maister goesbishop halls satires qui vit sans folie nest pas si sage quil croitla rochefoucault i lost no time in presenting my letters of introduction and they were as quickly acknowledged by invitations to balls and dinners paris was full to excess and of a better description of english than those who usually overflow that reservoir of the world my first engagement was to dine with lord and lady bennington who were among the very few english intimate in the best french houses on entering paris i had resolved to set up a character for i was always of an ambitious nature and desirous of being distinguished from the ordinary herd after various cogitations as to the particular one i should assume i thought nothing appeared more likely to be remarkable among men and therefore pleasing to women than an egregious coxcomb accordingly i arranged my hair into ringlets dressed myself with singular plainness and simplicity a low person by the by would have done just the contrary and putting on an air of exceeding languor made my maiden appearance at lord benningtons the party was small and equally divided between french and english the former had been all emigrants and the conversation was chiefly in our own tongue i was placed at dinner next to miss paulding an elderly young lady of some notoriety at paris very clever very talkative and very conceited a young pale illnatured looking man sat on her left hand this was mr aberton one of the attaches dear me said miss paulding what a pretty chain that is of yours mr aberton yes said the attache i know it must be pretty for i got it at brequets with the watch how common people always buy their opinions with their goods and regulate the height of the former by the mere price or fashion of the latter pray mr pelham said miss paulding turning to me have you got one of brequets watches yet watch said i do you think i could ever wear a watch i know nothing so plebeian what can any one but a man of business who has nine hours for his countinghouse and one for his dinner ever possibly want to know the time for an assignation you will say true but here i played with my best ringlet if a man is worth having he is surely worth waiting for miss paulding opened her eyes and mr aberton his mouth a pretty lively french woman opposite madame danville laughed and immediately joined in our conversation which on my part was during the whole dinner kept up exactly in the same strain what do you think of our streets said the old yet still animated madame de gs you will not find them i fear so agreeable for walking as the trottoirs in london really i answered i have only been once out in your streets at least a pied since my arrival and then i was nearly perishing for want of help what do you mean said madame danville why i fell into that intersecting stream which you call a kennel and i a river pray mr aberton what do you think i did in that dangerous dilemma why got out again as fast as you could said the literal attache no such thing i was too frightened i stood still and screamed for assistance madame danville was delighted and miss paulding astonished mr aberton muttered to a fat foolish lord luscombe what a damnation puppyand every one even to the old madame de gs looked at me six times as attentively as they had done before as for me i was perfectly satisfied with the effect i had produced and i went away the first in order to give the men an opportunity of abusing me for whenever the men abuse the women to support alike their coquetry and the conversation think themselves called upon to defend the next day i rode into the champs elysees i always valued myself particularly upon my riding and my horse was both the most fiery and the most beautiful in paris the first person i saw was madame danville at that moment i was reining in my horse and conscious as the wind waved my long curls that i was looking to the very best advantage i made my horse bound towards her carriage which she immediately stopped and speaking in my natural tone of voice and without the smallest affectation i made at once my salutations and my court i am going said she to the duchesse dgs this eveningit is her nightdo come i dont know her said i tell me your hotel and ill send you an invitation before dinner rejoined madame danville i lodge said i at the hotel de rue de rivoli au second at present next year i suppose according to the usual gradations in the life of a garcon i shall be au troisieme for here the purse and the person seem to be playing at seesawthe latter rises as the former descends we went on conversing for about a quarter of an hour in which i endeavoured to make the pretty frenchwoman believe that all the good opinion i possessed of myself the day before i had that morning entirely transferred to her account as i rode home i met mr aberton with three or four other men with that glaring goodbreeding so peculiar to the english he instantly directed their eyes towards me in one mingled and concentrated stare nimporte thought i they must be devilish clever fellows if they can find a single fault either in my horse or myself

<chapter>chapter xii pia mater plus quam se sapere et virtutibus esse priorem vult et ait prope verahorace vere mihi festus atras eximet curashorace the next morning i received a letter from my mother my dear henry began my affectionate and incomparable parent my dear henry you have now fairly entered the world and though at your age my advice may be but little followed my experience cannot altogether be useless i shall therefore make no apology for a few precepts which i hope may tend to make you a wiser and better man i hope in the first place that you have left your letter at the ambassadors and that you will not fail to go there as often as possible pay your court in particular to ladyshe is a charming person universally popular and one of the very few english people to whom one may safely be civil apropos of english civility you have i hope by this time discovered that you have to assume a very different manner with french people than with our own countrymen with us the least appearance of feeling or enthusiasm is certain to be ridiculed every where but in france you may venture to seem not quite devoid of all natural sentiments indeed if you affect enthusiasm they will give you credit for genius and they will place all the qualities of the heart to the account of the head you know that in england if you seem desirous of a persons acquaintance you are sure to lose it they imagine you have some design upon their wives or their dinners but in france you can never lose by politeness nobody will call your civility forwardness and pushing if the princess de t and the duchesse de d ask you to their houses which indeed they will directly you have left your letters go there two or three times a week if only for a few minutes in the evening it is very hard to be acquainted with great french people but when you are it is your own fault if you are not intimate with them most english people have a kind of diffidence and scruple at calling in the eveningthis is perfectly misplaced the french are never ashamed of themselves like us whose persons families and houses are never fit to be seen unless they are dressed out for a party dont imagine that the ease of french manners is at all like what we call ease you must not lounge on your chairnor put your feet upon a stoolnor forget yourself for one single moment when you are talking with women you have heard a great deal about the gallantries of the french ladies but remember that they demand infinitely greater attention than english women do and that after a months incessant devotion you may lose every thing by a moments impolitesse you will not my dear son misinterpret these hints i suppose of course that all your liaisons are platonic your father is laid up with the gout and dreadfully illtempered and peevish however i keep out of the way as much as possible i dined yesterday at lady rosevilles she praised you very much said your manners were particularly good and that you had already quite the usage du monde lord vincent is i understand at paris though very tiresome with his learning and latin he is exceedingly clever and repandu be sure to cultivate his acquaintance if you are ever at a loss as to the individual character of a person you wish to gain the general knowledge of human nature will teach you one infallible specificflattery the quantity and quality may vary according to the exact niceties of art but in any quantity and in any quality it is more or less acceptable and therefore certain to please only never or at least very rarely flatter when other people besides the one to be flattered are by in that case you offend the rest and you make even your intended dupe ashamed to be pleased in general weak minds think only of others and yet seem only occupied with themselves you on the contrary must appear wholly engrossed with those about you and yet never have a single idea which does not terminate in yourself a fool my dear henry flatters himselfa wise man flatters the fool god bless you my dear child take care of your healthdont forget coulon and believe me your most affectionate mother f p by the time i had read this letter and dressed myself for the evening vincents carriage was at the porte cocher i hate the affection of keeping people waiting and went down so quickly that i met his facetious lordship upon the stairs devilish windy said i as we were getting into the carriage yes said vincent but the moral horace reminds us of our remedies as well as our misfortune jam galeam pallas et aegida currusque parat that is providence that prepares the gale gives us also a great coat and a carriage we were not long driving to the palais royal verys was crowded to excessa very low set said lord vincent who being half a liberal is of course a thorough aristocrat looking round at the various english who occupied the apartment there was indeed a motley congregation country esquires extracts from the universities halfpay officers city clerks in frogged coats and mustachios two or three of a better looking description but in reality half swindlers half gentlemen all in short fit specimens of that wandering tribe which spread over the continent the renown and the ridicule of good old england i know not why it is that we should look and act so very disgracefully abroad but i never meet in any spot out of this happy island a single englishman without instinctively blushing for my native country garcon garcon cried a stout gentleman who made one of three at the table next to us donneznous une sole frite pour un et des pommes de terre pour trois humph said lord vincent fine ideas of english taste these garcons must entertain men who prefer fried soles and potatoes to the various delicacies they can command here might by the same perversion of taste prefer bloomfields poems to byrons delicate taste depends solely upon the physical construction and a man who has it not in cookery must want it in literature fried sole and potatoes if i had written a volume whose merit was in elegance i would not show it to such a manbut he might be an admirable critic upon cobbetts register or every man his own brewer excessively true said i what shall we order dabord des huitres dostende said vincent as to the rest taking hold of the carte deliberare utilia mora utilissima est we were soon engaged in all the pleasures and pains of a dinner petimus said lord vincent helping himself to some poulet a lausterlitz petimus bene viverequod petis hic est we were not however assured of that fact at the termination of dinner if half the dishes were well conceived and better executed the other half were proportionably bad very is indeed no longer the prince of restaurateurs the low english who have flocked there have entirely ruined the place what waiterwhat cook can possibly respect men who take no soup and begin with a roti who know neither what is good nor what is bad who eat rognons at dinner instead of at breakfast and fall into raptures over sauce robert and pieds de cochon who cannot tell at the first taste whether the beaune is premiere qualite or the fricassee made of yesterdays chicken who suffer in the stomach after champignon and die with indigestion of a truffle o english people english people why can you not stay and perish of apoplexy and yorkshire pudding at home by the time we had drank our coffee it was considerably past nine oclock and vincent had business at the ambassadors before ten we therefore parted for the night what do you think of verys said i as we were at the door why replied vincent when i recal the astonishing heat of the place which has almost sent me to sleep the exceeding number of times in which that becasse had been reroasted and the extortionate length of our bills i say of verys what hamlet said of the world weary stale and unprofitable </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiii i would fight with broad swords and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> and sink point on the first blood drawn like a gentlemansthe chronicles of the canongate i strolled idly along

being somewhat curious to enter some of the smaller cafes i went into one of the meanest of them took up a journal des spectacles and called for some lemonade at the next table to me sat two or three frenchmen evidently of inferior rank and talking very loudly over langleterre et les anglois their attention was soon fixed upon me have you ever observed that if people are disposed to think ill of you nothing so soon determines them to do so as any act of yours which however innocent and inoffensive differs from their ordinary habits and customs no sooner had my lemonade made its appearance than i perceived an increased sensation among my neighbours of the next table in the first place lemonade is not much drank as you may suppose among the french in winter and in the second my beverage had an appearance of ostentation from being one of the dearest articles i could have called for unhappily i dropped my newspaperit fell under the frenchmens table instead of calling the garcon i was foolish enough to stoop for it myself it was exactly under the feet of one of the frenchmen i asked him with the greatest civility to move he made no reply i could not for the life of me refrain from giving him a slight very slight push the next moment he moved in good earnest the whole party sprung up as he set the example the offended leg gave three terrific stamps upon the ground and i was immediately assailed by a whole volley of unintelligible abuse at that time i was very little accustomed to french vehemence and perfectly unable to reply to the vituperations i received instead of answering them i therefore deliberated what was best to be done if thought i i walk away they will think me a coward and insult me in the streets if i challenge them i shall have to fight with men probably no better than shopkeepers if i strike this most noisy amongst them he may be silenced or he may demand satisfaction if the former well and good if the latter why i shall have a better excuse for fighting him than i should have now my resolution was therefore taken i was never more free from passion in my life and it was therefore with the utmost calmness and composure that in the midst of my antagonists harangue i raised my hand andquietly knocked him down he rose in a moment sortons said he in a low tone a frenchman never forgives a blow at that moment an englishman who had been sitting unnoticed in an obscure corner of the cafe came up and took me aside sir said he dont think of fighting the man he is a tradesman in the rue st honore i myself have seen him behind the counter remember that a ram may kill a butcher sir i replied i thank you a thousand times for your information fight however i must and ill give you like the irishman my reasons afterwards perhaps you will be my second with pleasure said the englishman a frenchman would have said with pain we left the cafe together my countryman asked them if he should go the gunsmiths for the pistols pistols said the frenchmans second we will only fight with swords no no said my new friend on ne prend le lievre au tabourin we are the challenged and therefore have the choice of weapons luckily i overheard this dispute and called to my secondswords or pistols said i it is quite the same to me i am not bad at either only do make haste swords then were chosen and soon procured frenchmen never grow cool upon their quarrels and as it was a fine clear starlight night we went forthwith to the bois de boulogne we fixed our ground on a spot tolerably retired and i should think pretty often frequented for the same purpose i was exceedingly confident for i knew myself to have few equals in the art of fencing and i had all the advantage of coolness which my hero was a great deal too much in earnest to possess we joined swords and in a very few moments i discovered that my opponents life was at my disposal cest bien thought i for once ill behave handsomely the frenchman made a desperate lunge i struck his sword from his hand caught it instantly and presenting it to him again said i think myself peculiarly fortunate that i may now apologize for the affront i have put upon you will you permit my sincerest apologies to suffice a man who can so well resent an injury can forgive one was there ever a frenchman not taken by a fine phrase my hero received the sword with a low bowthe tears came into his eyes sir said he you have twice conquered we left the spot with the greatest amity and affection and reentered with a profusion of bows our several fiacres let me i said when i found myself alone with my second let me thank you most cordially for your assistance and allow me to cultivate an acquaintance so singularly begun i lodge at the hotel de rue de rivoli my name is pelham yours is thornton replied my countryman i will lose no time in profiting by an offer of acquaintance which does me so much honour with these and various other fine speeches we employed the time till i was set down at my hotel and my companion drawing his cloak round him departed on foot to fulfil he said with a mysterious air a certain assignation in the faubourg st germain i said to mr thornton that i would give him many reasons for fighting after i had fought as i do not remember that i ever did and as i am very unwilling that they should be lost i am now going to bestow them on the reader it is true that i fought a tradesman his rank in life made such an action perfectly gratuitous on my part and to many people perhaps perfectly unpardonable the following was however my view of the question in striking him i had placed myself on his level if i did so in order to insult him i had a right also to do it in order to give him the only atonement in my power had the insult come solely from him i might then with some justice have intrenched myself in my superiority of rankcontempt would have been as optional as revenge but i had left myself no alternative in being the aggressor for if my birth was to preserve me from redressing an injury it was also to preserve me from committing one i confess that the thing would have been wholly different had it been an english instead of a french man and this because of the different view of the nature and importance of the affront which the englishman would take no english tradesman has an idea of les lois darmesa blow can be returned or it can be paid for but in france neither a setto nor an action for assault would repay the generality of any class removed from the poverty of the bas peuple for so great and inexcusable an affront in all countries it is the feelings of the generality of people that courtesy which is the essence of honour obliges one to consult as in england i should therefore have paid so in france i fought if it be said that a french gentleman would not have been equally condescending to a french tradesman i answer that the former would never have perpetrated the only insult for which the latter might think there could be only one atonement besides even if this objection held good there is a difference between the duties of a native and a stranger in receiving the advantages of a foreign country one ought to be doubly careful not to give offence and it is therefore doubly incumbent upon us to redress it when given to the feelings of the person i had offended there was but one redress who can blame me if i granted it </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiv erat homo ingeniosus acutus acer et qui plurimum et salis haberet et fellis nec candoris minuspliny i do not know a more difficult character to describe than lord vincents did i imitate certain writers who think that the whole art of pourtraying individual character is to seize hold of some prominent peculiarity and to introduce this distinguishing trait in all times and in all scenes the difficulty would be removed i should only have to present to the reader a man whose conversation was nothing but alternate jest and quotationa due union of yorick and partridge this would however be rendering great injustice to the character i wish to delineate there were times when vincent was earnestly engrossed in discussion in which a jest rarely escaped him and quotation was introduced only as a serious illustration not as a humorous peculiarity he possessed great miscellaneous erudition and a memory perfectly surprising for its fidelity and extent he was a severe critic and had a peculiar art of quoting from each author he reviewed some part that particularly told against him like most men in the theory of philosophy he was tolerably rigid in its practice more than tolerably loose by his tenets you would have considered him a very cato for stubbornness and sternness yet was he a very child in his concession to the whim of the moment fond of meditation and research he was still fonder of mirth and amusement and while he was among the most instructive he was also the boonest of companions when alone with me or with men whom he imagined like me his pedantry for more or less he always </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> always was pedantic took only a jocular tone with the savan or the bel esprit it became grave searching and sarcastic he was rather a contradicter than a favourer of ordinary opinions and this perhaps led him not unoften into paradox yet was there much soundness even in his most vehement notions and the strength of mind which made him think only for himself was visible in all the productions it created i have hitherto only given his conversation in one of its moods henceforth i shall be just enough occasionally to be dull and to present it sometimes to the reader in a graver tone buried deep beneath the surface of his character was a hidden yet a restless ambition but this was perhaps at present a secret even to himself we know not our own characters till time teaches us selfknowledge if we are wise we may thank ourselves if we are great we must thank fortune it was this insight into vincents nature which drew us closer together i recognized in the man who as yet was only playing a part a resemblance to myself while he perhaps saw at times that i was somewhat better than the voluptuary and somewhat wiser than the coxcomb which were all that at present it suited me to appear in person vincent was short and though not illyet ungracefully madebut his countenance was singularly fine his eyes were dark bright and penetrating and his forehead high and thoughtful corrected the playful smile of his mouth which might otherwise have given to his features too great an expression of levity he was not positively ill dressed yet he paid no attention to any external art except cleanliness his usual garb was a brown coat much too large for him a coloured neckcloth a spotted waistcoat grey trowsers and short gaiters add to these gloves of most unsullied doeskin and a curiously thick cane and the portrait is complete in manners he was civil or rude familiar or distant just as the whim seized him never was there any address less common and less artificial what a rare gift by the by is that of manners how difficult to definehow much more difficult to impart better for a man to possess them than wealth beauty or talent they will more than supply all no attention is too minute no labour too exaggerated which tends to perfect them he who enjoys their advantages in the highest degree viz he who can please penetrate persuade as the object may require possesses the subtlest secret of the diplomatist and the statesman and wants nothing but opportunity to become great </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xv le plaisir de la societe entre les amis se cultive par une ressemblance de gout sur ce qui regarde les moeurs et par quelque difference dopinions sur les sciences par la ou lon saffermit dans ses sentiments ou lon sexerce et lon sinstruit par la disputela bruyere there was a party at monsieur de ves to which vincent and myself were the only englishmen invited accordingly as the hotel de v was in the same street as my hotel we dined together at my rooms and walked from thence to the ministers house the party was as stiff and formal as such assemblies invariably are and we were both delighted when we espied monsieur da a man of much conversational talent and some celebrity as an ultra writer forming a little group in one corner of the room we took advantage of our acquaintance with the urbane frenchman to join his party the conversation turned almost entirely on literary subjects allusion being made to schlegels history of literature and the severity with which he speaks of helvetius and the philosophers of his school we began to discuss what harm the freethinkers in philosophy had effected for my part said vincent i am not able to divine why we are supposed in works where there is much truth and little falsehood much good and a little evil to see only the evil and the falsehood to the utter exclusion of the truth and the good all men whose minds are sufficiently laborious or acute to love the reading of metaphysical inquiries will by the same labour and acuteness separate the chaff from the cornthe false from the true it is the young the light the superficial who are easily misled by error and incapable of discerning its fallacy but tell me if it is the light the young the superficial who are in the habit of reading the abstruse and subtle speculations of the philosopher no no believe me that it is the very studies monsieur schlegel recommends which do harm to morality and virtue it is the study of literature itself the play the poem the novel which all minds however frivolous can enjoy and understand that constitute the real foes to religion and moral improvement ma foi cried monsieur de g who was a little writer and a great reader of romances why you would not deprive us of the politer literature you would not bid us shut up our novels and burn our theatres certainly not replied vincent and it is in this particular that i differ from certain modern philosophers of our own country for whom for the most part i entertain the highest veneration i would not deprive life of a single grace or a single enjoyment but i would counteract whatever is pernicious in whatever is elegant if among my flowers there is a snake i would not root up my flowers i would kill the snake thus who are they that derive from fiction and literature a prejudicial effect we have seen alreadythe light and superficialbut who are they that derive profit from themthey who enjoy well regulated and discerning minds who pleasureall mankind would it not therefore be better instead of depriving some of profit and all of pleasure by banishing poetry and fiction from our utopia to correct the minds which find evil where if they were properly instructed they would find good whether we agree with helvetius that all men are born with an equal capacity of improvement or merely go the length with all other metaphysicians that education can improve the human mind to an extent yet incalculable it must be quite clear that we can give sound views instead of fallacies and make common truths as easy to discern and adopt as common errors but if we effect this which we all allow is so easy with our children if we strengthen their minds instead of weakening them and clear their vision rather than confuse it from that moment we remove the prejudicial effects of fiction and just as we have taught them to use a knife without cutting their fingers we teach them to make use of fiction without perverting it to their prejudice what philosopher was ever hurt by reading the novels of crebillon or seeing the comedies of moliere you understand me then monsieur de g i do it is true think that polite literature as it is termed is prejudicial to the superficial but for that reason i would not do away with the literature i would do away with the superficial i deny said m da that this is so easy a taskyou cannot make all men wise no replied vincent but you can all children at least to a certain extent since you cannot deny the prodigious effects of education you must allow that they will at least give common sense for it they cannot do this they can do nothing now common sense is all that is necessary to distinguish what is good and evil whether it be in life or in books but then your education must not be that of public teaching and private fooling you must not counteract the effects of common sense by instilling prejudice or encouraging weakness your education may not be carried to the utmost goal but as far as it does go you must see that the road is clear now for instance with regard to fiction you must not first as is done in all modern education admit the disease and then dose with warm water to expel it you must not put fiction into your childs hands and not give him a single principle to guide his judgment respecting it till his mind has got wedded to the poison and too weak by its long use to digest the antidote no first fortify his intellect by reason and you may then please his fancy by fiction do not excite his imagination with love and glory till you can instruct his judgment as to what love and glory are teach him in short to reflect before you permit him full indulgence to imagine here there was a pause monsieur dalooked very illpleased and poor monsieur de gthought that somehow or other his romance writing was called into question in order to soothe them i introduced some subject which permitted a little national flattery the conversation then turned insensibly on the character of the french people never said vincent has there been a character more often describednever one less understood you have been termed superficial i think of all people that you least deserve the accusation with regard to the few your philosophers your mathematicians your men of science are consulted by those of other nations as some of their profoundest authorities with regard to the many the charge is still more unfounded compare your mob whether of gentlemen or plebeians to those of germany italyeven englandand i own in spite of my national prepossessions that the comparison is infinitely in your favour the country gentlemen the lawyer the petit maitre of england are proverbially inane and illinformed with you the classes of society that answer to those respective grades have much information in literature and often not a little in science in like manner your tradesmen your mechanics your servants are beyond all measure of larger better cultivated and less prejudiced minds than those ranks in england the fact is that all with you pretend to be savans and this is the chief reason why you have been censured as shallow we see your fine gentleman or your petit bourgeois give himself the </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> the airs of a critic or a philosopher and because he is neither a scaliger nor a newton we forget that he is only the bourgeois or the pelit maitre and set down all your philosophers and critics with the censure of superficiality which this shallow individual of a shallow order may justly have deserved we the english it is true do not expose ourselves thus our dandies our tradesmen do not vent second rate philosophy on the human mind nor on les beaux arts but why is this not because they are better informed than their correspondent ciphers in france but because they are much worse not because they can say a great deal more on the subject but because they can say nothing at all you do us more than justice said monsieur da in this instance are you disposed to do us justice also in another it is a favourite propensity of your countrymen to accuse us of heartlessness and want of feeling think you that this accusation is deserved by no means replied vincent the same cause that brought on the erroneous censure we have before mentioned appears to me also to have created this viz a sort of palais royal vanity common to all your nation which induces you to make as much display at the shop window as possible you show great cordiality and even enthusiasm to strangers you turn your back on themyou forget them how heartless cry we not at all the english show no cordiality no enthusiasm to strangers it is true but they equally turn their backs on them and equally forget them the only respect therefore in which they differ from you is the previous kindness now if we are to receive strangers i can really see no reason why we are not to be as civil to them as possible and so far from imputing the desire to please them to a bad heart i think it a thousand times more amiable and benevolent than telling them a langlaise by your morosity and reserve that you do not care a pin what becomes of them if i am only to walk a mile with a man why should i not make that mile as pleasant to him as i can or why above all if i choose to be sulky and tell him to go and be dd am i to swell out my chest colour with conscious virtue and cry see what a good heart i have ah monsieur da since benevolence is inseparable from all morality it must be clear that there is a benevolence in little things as well as in great and that he who strives to make his fellow creatures happy though only for an instant is a much better man than he who is indifferent to or what is worse despises it nor do i to say truth see that kindness to an acquaintance is at all destructive to sincerity to a friend on the contrary i have yet to learn that you are according to the customs of your country worse friends worse husbands or worse fathers than we are what cried i you forget yourself vincent how can the private virtues be cultivated without a coal fire is not domestic affection a synonymous term with domestic hearth and where do you find either except in honest old england true replied vincent and it is certainly impossible for a father and his family to be as fond of each other on a bright day in the tuilleries or at versailles with music and dancing and fresh air as they would be in a back parlour by a smoky hearth occupied entirely by le bon pere et la bonne mere while the poor little children sit at the other end of the table whispering and shivering debarred the vent of all natural spirits for fear of making a noise and strangely uniting the idea of the domestic hearth with that of a hobgoblin and the association of dear papa with that of a birch rod we all laughed at this reply and monsieur da rising to depart said well well milord your countrymen are great generalizers in philosophy they reduce human actions to two grand touchstones all hilarity they consider the sign of a shallow mind and all kindness the token of a false heart </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvi quis sapiens bono confidat fragiliseneca grammatici certant et adhuc sub judice lis esthorace when i first went to paris i took a french master to perfect me in the parisian pronunciation this haberdasher of pronouns was a person of the name of margot he was a tall solemn man with a face of the most imperturbable gravity he would have been inestimable as an undertaker his hair was of a pale yellow you would have thought it had caught a bilious complaint from his complexion the latter was indeed of so sombre a saffron that it looked as if ten livers had been forced into a jaundice in order to supply its colour his forehead was high bald and very narrow his cheekbones were extremely prominent and his cheeks so thin that they seemed happier than pyramus and thisbe and kissed each other inside without any separation or division his face was as sharp and almost as long as an inverted pyramid and was garnished on either side by a miserable half starved whisker which seemed scarcely able to maintain itself amid the general symptoms of atrophy and decay this charming countenance was supported by a figure so long so straight so shadowy that you might have taken it for the monument in a consumption but the chief characteristic of the man was the utter and wonderful gravity i have before spoken of you could no more have coaxed a smile out of his countenance than you could out of the poker and yet monsieur margot was by no means a melancholy man he loved his joke and his wine and his dinner just as much as if he had been of a fatter frame and it was a fine specimen of the practical antithesis to hear a good story or a jovial expression leap friskily out of that long curved mouth it was at once a paradox and a bathosit was the mouse coming out of its hole in ely cathedral i said that this gravity was m margots most especial characteristic i forgothe had two others equally remarkable the one was an ardent admiration for the chivalrous the other an ardent admiration for himself both of these are traits common enough in a frenchman but in mons margot their excesses rendered them uncommon he was a most ultra specimen of le chevalier amoureuxa mixture of don quixote and the duc de lauzun whenever he spoke of the present tense even en professeur he always gave a sigh to the preterite and an anecdote of bayard whenever he conjugated a verb he paused to tell me that the favourite one of his female pupils was je taime in short he had tales of his own good fortune and of other peoples brave exploits which without much exaggeration were almost as long and had perhaps as little substance as himself but the former was his favourite topic to hear him one would have imagined that his face in borrowing the sharpness of the needle had borrowed also its attractionand then the prettiness of mons margots modesty it is very extraordinary said he very extraordinary for i have no time to give myself up to those affairs it is not monsieur as if i had your leisure to employ all the little preliminary arts of creating la belle passion non monsieur i go to church to the play to the tuilleries for a brief relaxationand me voila partout accable with my good fortune i am not handsome monsieur at least not very it is true that i have expression a certain air noble my first cousin monsieur is the chevalier de margot and above all de la me in my physiognomy the women love soul monsieursomething intellectual and spiritual always attracts them yet my success certainly is singular bah monsieur replied i with dignity expression and soul how could the heart of any french woman resist you no you do yourself injustice it was said of caesar that he was great without an effort much more then may monsieur margot be happy without an exertion ah monsieur rejoined the frenchman still looking as weak as earnest and as gravely out as sober lanesbro dancing with the gout ah monsieur there is a depth and truth in your remarks worthy of montaigne as it is impossible to account for the caprices of women so it is impossible for ourselves to analyze the merit they discover in us but monsieur hear meat the house where i lodge there is an english lady en pension eh bien monsieur you guess the rest she has taken a caprice for me and this very night she will admit me to her apartment she is very handsomeah quelle est belle une jolie petite bouche une denture eblouissante un nez tout afait grec in fine quite a bouton de rose i expressed my envy at monsieur margots good fortune and when he had sufficiently dilated upon it he withdrew shortly afterwards vincent enteredi have a dinner invitation for both of us today said he you will come most certainly replied i but who is the person we are to honour a madame laurent replied vincent one of those ladies only found at paris who live upon anything rather than their income she keeps a tolerable table haunted with poles russians austrians and idle frenchmen peregrinae gentis amaenum hospitium as yet she has not the happiness to be acquainted with any englishmen though she boards one of our countrywomen and as she is desirous of making her fortune as soon as possible she is very anxious of having that honour she has heard vast reports of our wealth and wisdom and flatters herself that we are so many ambulatory indies in good truth a frenchwoman thinks she is never in want of a fortune as long as there is a rich fool in the world stultitiam patiuntur opes is </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> is her hope and ut tu fortunam sic nos te celse feremus is her motto madame laurent repeated i why surely that is the name of mons margots landlady i hope not cried vincent for the sake of our dinner he reflects no credit on her good cheer who eats fat dinners should himself be fat at all events said i we can try the good lady for once i am very anxious to see a countrywoman of ours probably the very one you speak of whom mons margot eulogizes in glowing colours and who has moreover taken a violent fancy for my solemn preceptor what think you of that vincent nothing extraordinary replied vincent the lady only exclaims with the moralist love virtue valour yea all human charms are shrunk and centred in that heap of bones oh there are wondrous beauties in the grave i made some punning rejoinder and we sallied out to earn an appetite in the tuilleries for madame laurents dinner at the hour of halfpast five we repaired to our engagement madame laurent received us with the most evident satisfaction and introduced us forthwith to our countrywoman she was a pretty fair shrewd looking person with an eye and lip which unless it greatly belied her showed her much more inclined as an amante to be merry and wise than honest and true presently monsieur margot made his appearance though very much surprised at seeing me he did not appear the least jealous of my attentions to his inamorata indeed the good gentleman was far too much pleased with himself to be susceptible of the suspicions common to less fortunate lovers at dinner i sat next to the pretty englishwoman whose name was green monsieur margot said i has often spoken to me of you before i had the happiness of being personally convinced how true and unexaggerated were his sentiments oh cried mrs green with an arch laugh you are acquainted with monsieur margot then i have that honour said i i receive from him every morning lessons both in love and languages he is perfect master of both mrs green burst out into one of those peals so peculiarly british ah le pauvre professeur cried she he is too absurd he tells me said i gravely that he is quite accable with his bonnes fortunespossibly he flatters himself that even you are not perfectly inaccessible to his addresses tell me mr pelham said the fair mrs green can you pass by this street about half past twelve tonight i will make a point of doing so replied i not a little surprised by the remark do said she and now let us talk of old england when we went away i told vincent of my appointment what said he eclipse monsieur margot impossible you are right replied i nor is it my hope there is some trick afloat of which we may as well be spectators de tout mon coeur answered vincent let us go till then to the duchesse de g i assented and we drove to the rue de the duchesse de gwas a fine relict of the ancien regimetall and stately with her own grey hair crepe and surmounted by a high cap of the most dazzling blonde she had been one of the earliest emigrants and had stayed for many months with my mother whom she professed to rank amongst her dearest friends the duchesse possessed to perfection that singular melange of ostentation and ignorance which was so peculiar to the anterevolutionists she would talk of the last tragedy with the emphatic tone of a connoisseur in the same breath that she would ask with marie antoinette why the poor people were so clamorous for bread when they might buy such nice cakes for twopence apiece to give you an idea of the irish said she one day to an inquisitive marquess know that they prefer potatoes to mutton her soirees were among the most agreeable at parisshe united all the rank and talent to be found in the ultra party for she professed to be quite a female maecenas and whether it was a mathematician or a romancewriter a naturalist or a poet she held open house for all and conversed with each with equal fluency and selfsatisfaction a new play had just been acted and the conversation after a few preliminary hoverings settled upon it you see said the duchesse that we have actors you authors of what avail is it that you boast of a shakspeare since your liseton great as he is cannot be compared with our talma and yet said i preserving my gravity with a pertinacity which nearly made vincent and the rest of our compatriots assembled lose theirs madame must allow that there is a striking resemblance in their persons and the sublimity of their acting pour ca jen conviens replied this critique de lecole des femmes mais cependant liseton na pas la nature lame la grandeur de talma and will you then allow us no actors of merit asked vincent mais ouidans le genre comique par exemple votre buffo kean met dix fois plus desprit et de drollerie dans ses roles que la porte the impartial and profound judgment of madame admits of no further discussion on this point said i what does she think of the present state of our dramatic literature why replied madame you have many great poets but when they write for the stage they lose themselves entirely your valter scotes play of robe roi is very inferior to his novel of the same name it is a great pity said i that byron did not turn his childe harold into a tragedyit has so much energyactionvariety very true said madame with a sigh but the tragedy is after all only suited to our nationwe alone carry it to perfection yet said i goldoni wrote a few fine tragedies eh bien said madame one rose does not constitute a garden and satisfied with this remark la femme savante turned to a celebrated traveller to discuss with him the chance of discovering the north pole there were one or two clever englishmen present vincent and i joined them have you met the persian prince yet said sir george lynton to me he is a man of much talent and great desire of knowledge he intends to publish his observations on paris and i suppose we shall have an admirable supplement to montesquieus lettres persannes i wish we had said vincent there are few better satires on a civilized country than the observations of visitors less polished while on the contrary the civilized traveller in describing the manners of the american barbarian instead of conveying ridicule upon the visited points the sarcasm on the visitor and tacitus could not have thought of a finer or nobler satire on the roman luxuries than that insinuated by his treatise on the german simplicity what said monsieur dean intelligent cidevant emigre what political writer is generally esteemed as your best it is difficult to say replied vincent since with so many parties we have many idols but i think i might venture to name bolingbroke as among the most popular perhaps indeed it would be difficult to select a name more frequently quoted and discussed than his and yet his political works are the least valuable part of his remains and though they contain many lofty sentiments and many beautiful yet scattered truths they were written when legislation most debated was least understood and ought to be admired rather as excellent for the day than estimable in themselves the life of bolingbroke would convey a juster moral than all his writings and the author who gives us a full and impartial memoir of that extraordinary man will have afforded both to the philosophical and political literature of england one of its greatest desideratums it seems to me said monsieur de that your national literature is peculiarly deficient in biographyam i right in my opinion indubitably said vincent we have not a single work that can be considered a model in biography excepting perhaps middletons life of cicero this brings on a remark i have often made in distinguishing your philosophy from ours it seems to me that you who excel so admirably in biography memoirs comedy satirical observation on peculiar classes and pointed aphorisms are fonder of considering man in his relation to society and the active commerce of the world than in the more abstracted and metaphysical operations of the mind our writers on the contrary love to indulge rather in abstruse speculations on their speciesto regard man in an abstract and isolated point of view and to see him think alone in his chamber while you prefer beholding him act with the multitude in the world it must be allowed said monsieur det that if this be true our philosophy is the most useful though yours may be the most profound vincent did not reply yet said sir george lynton there will be a disadvantage attending your writings of this description which by diminishing their general applicability diminish their general utility works which treat upon man in his relation to society can only be strictly applicable so long as that relation to society treated upon continues for instance the play which satirizes a particular class however deep its reflections and accurate its knowledge upon the subject satirized must necessarily be obsolete when the class itself has become so the political pamphlet admirable for one state may be absurd in another the novel which exactly delineates the present age may seem strange and unfamiliar to the next and thus works which treat of men relatively and not man in se must often confine their popularity to the age and even the country in which they were written while on the other hand the work which treats of man himself which seizes discovers analyzes the human mind as it is whether in the ancient or the modern the savage or the european must evidently be applicable and consequently useful to all times and all nations he who discovers the circulation of the blood or the origin of ideas must be a philosopher to every people who have veins or ideas but he who even most successfully </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> successfully delineates the manners of one country or the actions of one individual is only the philosopher of a single country or a single age if monsieur det you will condescend to consider this you will see perhaps that the philosophy which treats of man in his relations is not so useful because neither so permanent nor so invariable as that which treats of man in himself note yet hume holds the contrary opinion to this and considers a good comedy more durable than a system of philosophy hume is right if by a system of philosophy is understooda pile of guesses false but plausible set up by one age to be destroyed by the next ingenuity cannot rescue error from oblivion but the moment wisdom has discovered truth she has obtained immortality i was now somewhat weary of this conversation and though it was not yet twelve i seized upon my appointment as an excuse to departaccordingly i rose for that purpose i suppose said i to vincent that you will not leave your discussion pardon me said he amusement is quite as profitable to a man of sense as metaphysics allons </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvii i was in this terrible situation when the basket stoptoriental taleshistory of the basket we took our way to the street in which madame laurent resided meanwhile suffer me to get rid of myself and to introduce you dear reader to my friend monsieur margot the whole of whose adventures were subsequently detailed to me by the garrulous mrs green at the hour appointed he knocked at the door of my fair countrywoman and was carefully admitted he was attired in a dressinggown of seagreen silk in which his long lean hungry body looked more like a river pike than any thing human madame said he with a solemn air i return you my best thanks for the honour you have done mebehold me at your feet and so saying the lean lover gravely knelt down on one knee rise sir said mrs green i confess that you have won my heart but that is not allyou have yet to show that you are worthy of the opinion i have formed of you it is not monsieur margot your person that has won meno it is your chivalrous and noble sentimentsprove that these are genuine and you may command all from my admiration in what manner shall i prove it madame said monsieur margot rising and gracefully drawing his seagreen gown more closely round him by your courage your devotion and your gallantry i ask but one proofyou can give it me on the spot you remember monsieur that in the days of romance a lady threw her glove upon the stage on which a lion was exhibited and told her lover to pick it up monsieur margot the trial to which i shall put you is less severe look and mrs green threw open the windowlook i throw my glove out into the streetdescend for it your commands are my law said the romantic margot i will go forthwith and so saying he went to the door hold sir said the lady it is not by that simple manner that you are to descendyou must go the same way as my glove out of the window out of the window madame said monsieur margot with astonished solemnity that is impossible because this apartment is three stories high and consequently i shall be dashed to pieces by no means answered the dame in that corner of the room there is a basket to which already foreseeing your determination i have affixed a rope by that basket you shall descend see monsieur what expedients a provident love can suggest hem said very slowly monsieur margot by no means liking the airy voyage imposed upon him but the rope may break or your hand may suffer it to slip feel the rope cried the lady to satisfy you as to your first doubt and as to the second can youcan you imagine that my affections would not make me twice as careful of your person as of my own fie ungrateful monsieur margot fie the melancholy chevalier cast a rueful look at the basket madame said he i own that i am very averse to the plan you propose suffer me to go down stairs in the ordinary way your glove can be as easily picked up whether your adorer goes out of the door or the window it is only madame when ordinary means fail that we should have recourse to the extraordinary begone sir exclaimed mrs green begone i now perceive that your chivalry was only a pretence fool that i was to love you as i have donefool that i was to imagine a hero where i now find a pause madame i will obey youmy heart is firmsee that the rope is gallant monsieur margot cried the lady and going to her dressingroom she called her woman to her assistance the rope was of the most unquestionable thickness the basket of the most capacious dimensions the former was fastened to a strong hookand the latter lowered i go madame said monsieur margot feeling the rope but it really is a most dangerous exploit go monsieur and the god of st louis befriend you stop said monsieur margot let me fetch my coat the night is cold and my dressinggown thin nay nay my chevalier returned the dame i love you in that gown it gives you an air of grace and dignity quite enchanting it will give me my death of cold madame said monsieur margot earnestly bah said the englishwoman what knight ever feared cold besides you mistake the night is warm and you look so handsome in your gown do i said the vain monsieur margot with an iron expression of satisfaction if that is the case i will mind it less but may i return by the door yes replied the lady you see that i do not require too much from your devotionenter behold me said the french master inserting his body into the basket which immediately began to descend the hour and the police of course made the street empty the ladys handkerchief waved in token of encouragement and triumph when the basket was within five yards of the ground mrs green cried to her lover who had hitherto been elevating his serious countenance towards her in sober yet gallant sadnesslook look monsieurstraight before you the lover turned round as rapidly as his habits would allow him and at that instant the window was shut the light extinguished and the basket arrested there stood monsieur margot upright in the basket and there stopped the basket motionless in the air what were the exact reflections of monsieur margot in that position i cannot pretend to determine because he never favoured me with them but about an hour afterwards vincent and i who had been delayed on the road strolling up the street according to our appointment perceived by the dim lamps some opaque body leaning against the wall of madame laurents house at about the distance of fifteen feet from the ground we hastened our steps towards it a measured and serious voice which i well knew accosted usfor gods sake gentlemen procure me assistance i am the victim of a perfidious woman and expect every moment to be precipitated to the earth good heavens said i surely it is monsieur margot whom i hear what are you doing there shivering with cold answered monsieur margot in a tone tremulously slow but what are you in for i can see nothing but a dark substance i am in a basket replied monsieur margot and i should be very much obliged to you to let me out of it wellindeed said vincent for i was too much engaged in laughing to give a ready reply your chateaumargot has but a cool cellar but there are some things in the world easier said than done how are we to remove you to a more desirable place ah returned monsieur margot how indeed there is to be sure a ladder in the porters lodge long enough to deliver me but then think of the gibes and jeers of the porterit will get windi shall be ridiculed gentlemeni shall be ridiculedand what is worse i shall lose my pupils my good friend said i you had better lose your pupils than your life and the daylight will soon come and then instead of being ridiculed by the porter you will be ridiculed by the whole street monsieur margot groaned go then my friend said he procure the ladder oh those she devilswhat could make me such a fool whilst monsieur margot was venting his spleen in a scarcely articulate mutter we repaired to the lodge knocked up the porter communicated the accident and procured the ladder however an observant eye had been kept upon our proceedings and the window above was reopened though so silently that i only perceived the action the porter a jolly bluff heartylooking fellow stood grinning below with a lantern while we set the ladder which only just reached the basket against the wall the chevalier looked wistfully forth and then by the light of the lantern we had a fair view of his ridiculous figurehis teeth chattered woefully and the united cold without and anxiety within threw a double sadness and solemnity upon his withered countenance the night was very windy and every instant a rapid current seized the unhappy seagreen vesture whirled it in the air and threw it as if in scorn over the very face of the miserable professor the constant recurrence of this sportive irreverence of the galesthe high sides of the basket and the trembling agitation of the inmate never too agile rendered it a work of some time for monsieur margot to transfer himself from the basket to the ladder at length he had fairly got out one thin shivering leg thank god said the pious professorwhen at that instant the thanksgiving was checked and to monsieur margots inexpressible astonishment and dismay the basket rose five feet from the ladder leaving its tenant with one leg dangling out like a flag from a balloon the ascent was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was too rapid to allow monsieur margot even time for an exclamation and it was not till he had had sufficient leisure in his present elevation to perceive all its consequences that he found words to say with the most earnest tone of thoughtful lamentation one could not have foreseen thisit is really extremely distressingwould to god that i could get my leg in or my body out while we were yet too convulsed with laughter to make any comment upon the unlookedfor ascent of the luminous monsieur margot the basket descended with such force as to dash the lantern out of the hand of the porter and to bring the professor so precipitously to the ground that all the bones in his skin rattled audibly my god said he i am done forbe witness how inhumanly i have been murdered we pulled him out of the basket and carried him between us into the porters lodge but the woes of monsieur margot were not yet at their termination the room was crowded there was madame laurentthere was the german count whom the professor was teaching frenchthere was the french viscount whom he was teaching germanthere were all his fellowlodgersthe ladies whom he had boasted ofthe men he had boasted todon juan in the infernal regions could not have met with a more unwelcome set of old acquaintance than monsieur margot had the happiness of opening his bewildered eyes upon in the porters lodge what cried they all monsieur margot is that you who have been frightening us so we thought the house was attacked the russian general is at this very moment loading his pistols lucky for you that you did not choose to stay longer in that situation pray monsieur what could induce you to exhibit yourself so in your dressinggown too and the night so cold arnt you ashamed of yourself all this and infinitely more was levelled against the miserable professor who stood shivering with cold and fright and turning his eyes first upon one and then on another as the exclamations circulated round the room i do assure you at length he began no no cried one it is of no use explaining now mais messieurs querulously recommenced the unhappy margot hold your tongue exclaimed madame laurent you have been disgracing my house mais madame ecoutezmoi no no cried the german we saw youwe saw you mais monsieur le comte fie fie cried the frenchman mais monsisur le vicomte at this every mouth was opened and the patience of monsieur margot being by this time exhausted he flew into a violent rage his tormentors pretended an equal indignation and at length he fought his way out of the room as fast as his shattered bones would allow him followed by the whole body screaming and shouting and scolding and laughing after him the next morning passed without my usual lesson from monsieur margot that was natural enough but when the next day and the next rolled on and brought neither monsieur margot nor his excuse i began to be uneasy for the poor man accordingly i sent to madame laurents to inquire after him judge of my surprise at hearing that he had early the day after his adventure left his lodgings with his small possession of books and clothes leaving only a note to madame laurent enclosing the amount of his debt to her and that none had since seen or heard of him from that day to this i have never once beheld him the poor professor lost even the little money due to him for his lessonsso true is it that in a man of monsieur margots temper even interest is a subordinate passion to vanity </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xviii it is good to be merry and wise its good to be honest and true it is good to be off with the old love before you be on with the newsong one morning when i was riding to the bois de boulogne the celebrated place of assignation in order to meet madame danville i saw a lady on horseback in the most imminent danger of being thrown her horse had taken fright at an english tandem or its driver and was plunging violently the lady was evidently much frightened and lost her presence of mind more and more every moment a man who was with her and who could scarcely manage his own horse appeared to be exceedingly desirous but perfectly unable to assist her and a great number of people were looking on doing nothing and saying good god how dangerous i have always had a great horror of being a hero in scenes and a still greater antipathy to females in distress however so great is the effect of sympathy upon the most hardened of us that i stopped for a few moments first to look on and secondly to assist just when a moments delay might have been dangerous i threw myself off my horse seized hers with one hand by the rein which she no longer had the strength to hold and assisted her with the other to dismount when all the peril was over monsieur her companion managed also to find his legs and i did not i confess wonder at his previous delay when i discovered that the lady in danger had been his wife he gave me a profusion of thanks and she made them more than complimentary by the glance which accompanied them their carriage was in attendance at a short distance behind the husband went for iti remained with the lady mr pelham she said i have heard much of you from my friend madame danville and have long been anxious for your acquaintance i did not think i should commence it with so great an obligation flattered by being already known by name and a subject of previous interest you may be sure that i tried every method to improve the opportunity i had gained and when i handed my new acquaintance into her carriage my pressure of her hand was somewhat more than slightly returned shall you be at the english ambassadors tonight said the lady as they were about to shut the door of the carriage certainly if you are to be there was my answer we shall meet then said madame and her look said more i rode into the bois and giving my horse to my servant as i came near passy where i was to meet madame danville i proceeded thither on foot i was just in sight of the spot and indeed of my inamorata when two men passed talking very earnestly they did not remark me but what individual could ever escape my notice the one was thornton the otherwho could he be where had i seen that pale but more than beautiful countenance before i looked again i was satisfied that i was mistaken in my first thought the hair was of a completely different colour no no said i it is not he yet how like i was distrait and absent during the whole time i was with madame danville the face of thorntons companion haunted me like a dream and to say the truth there were also moments when the recollection of my new engagement for the evening made me tired with that which i was enjoying the troublesome honour of keeping madame danville was not slow in perceiving the coldness of my behaviour though a frenchwoman she was rather grieved than resentful you are growing tired of me my friend she said and when i consider your youth and temptations i cannot be surprised at ityet i own that this thought gives me much greater pain than i could have supposed bah ma belle amie cried i you deceive yourselfi adore youi shall always adore you but its getting very late madame danville sighed and we parted she is not half so pretty or agreeable as she was thought i as i mounted my horse and remembered my appointment at the ambassadors i took unusual pains with my appearance that evening and drove to the ambassadors hotel in the rue faubourg st honore full half an hour earlier than i had ever done before i had been some time in the rooms without discovering my heroine of the morning the duchess of hn passed by what a wonderfully beautiful woman said mr howard de howard the spectral secretary of the embassy to mr aberton ay answered aberton but to my taste the duchesse de perpignan is quite equal to herdo you know her noyes said mr howard de howard that is not exactlynot well an englishman never owns that he does not know a duchess hem said mr aberton thrusting his large hand through his lank light hair hemcould one do anything do you think in that quarter i should think one might with a tolerable person answered the spectral secretary looking down at a pair of most shadowy supporters pray said aberton what do you think of miss they say she is an heiress think of her said the secretary who was as poor as he was thin why i have thought of her they say that fool pelham makes up to her little did mr aberton imagine when he made this remark that i was close behind him i should not imagine that was true said the secretary he is so occupied with madame danville pooh said aberton dictatorially she never had any thing to say to him why are you so sure said mr howard de howard why because he never showed any notes from her or ever even said he had a liaison with her himself ah that is quite enough said the secretary but is not that the duchesse de perpignan mr aberton turned and so did iour eyes methis fellwell they might after his courteous epithet to my name however i had far too good an opinion of myself to care one straw about his besides at that moment i was wholly lost in my surprise and pleasure in finding that this duchesse de perpignan was no other than my acquaintance of the morning she caught my gaze and smiled as she bowed now thought i as i approached her let </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> let us see if we cannot eclipse mr aberton all lovemaking is just the same and therefore i shall spare the reader my conversation that evening when he recollects that it was henry pelham who was the gallant i am persuaded that he will be pretty certain as to the success </chapter> </volume>

<chapter>chapter xix alea sequa vorax species certissima furti non contenta bonis animum quoque perfida mergitfurca furaxinfamis iners furiosa ruina petrarch dial i dined the next day at the freres provencaux an excellent restaurateurs bytheby where one gets irreproachable gibier and meets no english after dinner i strolled into the various gambling houses with which the palais royal abounds in one of these the crowd and heat were so great that i should immediately have retired if i had not been struck with the extreme and intense expression of interest in the countenance of one of the spectators at the rouge et noir table he was a man about forty years of age his complexion was dark and sallow the features prominent and what are generally called handsome but there was a certain sinister expression in his eyes and mouth which rendered the effect of his physiognomy rather disagreeable than prepossessing at a small distance from him and playing with an air which in its carelessness and nonchalance formed a remarkable contrast to the painful anxiety of the man i have just described sate mr thornton at first sight these two appeared to be the only englishmen present besides myself i was more struck by seeing the former in that scene than i was at meeting thornton there for there was something distingue in the mien of the stranger which suited far worse with the appearance of the place than the bourgeois air and dress of my cidevant second what another englishman thought i as i turned round and perceived a thick rough great coat which could possibly belong to no continental shoulders the wearer was standing directly opposite the seat of the swarthy stranger his hat was slouched over his face i moved in order to get a clearer view of his countenance it was the same person i had seen with thornton that morning never to this moment have i forgotten the stern and ferocious expression with which he was gazing upon the keen and agitated features of the gambler opposite in the eye and lip there was neither pleasure hatred nor scorn in their simple and unalloyed elements but each seemed blent and mingled into one deadly concentration of evil passions this man neither played nor spoke nor moved he appeared utterly insensible of every feeling in common with those around there he stood wrapt in his own dark and inscrutable thoughts never for one instant taking his looks from the varying countenance which did not observe their gaze nor altering the withering character of their almost demoniacal expression i could not tear myself from the spot i felt chained by some mysterious and undefinable interest my attention was first diverted into a new channel by a loud exclamation from the dark visaged gambler at the table it was the first he had uttered notwithstanding his anxiety and from the deep thrilling tone in which it was expressed it conveyed a keen sympathy with the overcharged feelings which it burst from with a trembling hand he took from an old purse the few napoleons that were still left there he set them all at one hazard on the rouge he hung over the table with a dropping lip his hands were tightly clasped in each other his nerves seemed strained into the last agony of excitation i ventured to raise my eyes upon the gaze which i felt must still be upon the gamblerthere it was fixed and stern as before but it now conveyed a deeper expression of joy than of the other passions which were there met yet a joy so malignant and fiendish that no look of mere anger or hatred could have so chilled my heart i dropped my eyes i redoubled my attention to the cardsthe last two were to be turned up a moment morethe fortune was to the noir the stranger had lost he did not utter a single word he looked with a vacant eye on the long mace with which the marker had swept away his last hopes with his last coin and then rising left the room and disappeared the other englishman was not long in following him he uttered a short low laugh unobserved perhaps by any one but myself and pushing through the atmosphere of sacres and mille tonnerres which filled that pandaemonium strode quickly to the door i felt as if a load had been taken from my bosom when he was gone </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xx reddere person ae scit convenientia cuiquehorace ars poetica i was loitering over my breakfast the next morning and thinking of the last nights scene when lord vincent was announced how fares the gallant pelham said he as he entered the room why to say the truth i replied i am rather under the influence of blue devils this morning and your visit is like a sunbeam in november a bright thought said vincent and i shall make you a very pretty little poet soon publish you in a neat octavo and dedicate you to lady de pray by the by have you ever read her plays you know they were only privately printed no said i for in good truth had his lordship interrogated me touching any other literary production i should have esteemed it a part of my present character to return the same answer no repeated vincent permit me to tell you that you must never seem ignorant of any work not published to be recherche one must always know what other people dontand then one has full liberty to sneer at the value of what other people do know renounce the threshold of knowledge there every new proselyte can meet you boast of your acquaintance with the sanctum and not one in ten thousand can dispute it with you have you read monsieur de cs pamphlet really said i i have been so busy ah mon ami cried vincent the greatest sign of an idle man is to complain of being busy but you have had a loss the pamphlet is good c by the way has an extraordinary though not an expanded mind it is like a citizens garden near london a pretty parterre here and a chinese pagoda there an oak tree in one corner and a mushroom bed in the other you may traverse the whole in a stride it is the four quarters of the globe in a molehill yet every thing is good in its kind and is neither without elegance nor design in its arrangement what do you think said i of the baron de the minister of of him replied vincent his soul still sits at squat and peeps not from its hole it is dark and bewilderedfull of dim visions of the ancient regimeit is a bat hovering about the chambers of an old ruin poor antique little soul but i will say nothing more about it for who would be satirical upon a thing so very small as the soul of the baron de finding lord vincent so disposed to the biting mood i immediately directed his rabies towards mr aberton for whom i had a most inexpressible contempt aberton said vincent in answer to my question if he knew that aimable attacheyes a sort of man who speaking of the english embassy says wewho sticks his best cards on his chimneypiece and writes himself billetsdoux from duchesses a duodecimo of precious conceits bound in calfskini know the man well does he not dress decently pelham his clothes are well made said i but no man can dress well with those hands and feet ah said vincent i should think he went to the best tailor and said give me a collar like lord so and sos one who would not dare to have a new waistcoat till it had been authoritatively patronized and who took his fashions like his follies from the best proficients such fellows are always too ashamed of themselves not to be proud of their clotheslike the chinese mariners they burn incense before the needle and mr howard de howard said i laughing what do you think of him what the thin secretary cried vincent he is the mathematical definition of a straight linelength without breadth his inseparable friend mr aberton was running up the rue st honore yesterday in order to catch him running cried i just like common peoplewhen were you or i ever seen running true continued vincent but when i saw him chasing that meagre apparition i said to bennington i have found out the real peter schlemil whoasked his grave lordship with serious naivete mr abertonsaid i dont you see him running after his shadow but the pride of the lean thing is so amusing he is fifteenth cousin to the duke and so his favourite exordium is whenever i succeed to the titles of my ancestorsit was but the other day that he heard two or three silly young men discussing church and state and they began by talking irreligionmr howard de howard is too unsubstantial not to be spiritually inclinedhowever he only fidgeted in his chair they then proceeded to be exceedingly disloyal mr howard de howard fidgeted againthey then passed to vituperations on the aristocracythis the attenuated pomposity magni nominis umbra could brook no longer he rose up cast a severe look on the abashed youths and thus addressed themgentlemen i have sate by in silence and heard my king derided and my god blasphemed but now in attacking the aristocracy i can no longer refrain from noticing so obviously intentional an insult you have become personal but did you know pelham that he is going to be married no said i i cant say that i thought such an event likely who is the intended a miss a girl with some fortune i can bring her none said he to the father but i can make her mrs howard de howard alas poor girl said i i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> i fear that her happiness will hang upon a slender thread but suppose we change the conversation first because the subject is so meagre that we might easily wear it out and secondly because such jests may come home i am not very corpulent myself bah said vincent but at least you have bones and muscles if you were to pound the poor secretary in a mortar you might take him all up in a pinch of snuff pray vincent said i after a short pause did you ever meet with a mr thornton at paris thornton thornton said vincent musingly what tom thornton i should think very likely i replied just the sort of man who would be tom thorntonhas a broad face with a colour and wears a spotted neckcloth tomwhat could his name be but tom is he about fiveandthirty asked vincent rather short and with reddish coloured hair and whiskers precisely said i are not all toms alike ah said vincent i know him well he is a clever shrewd fellow but a most unmitigated rascal he is the son of a steward in lancashire and received an attorneys education but being a humorous noisy fellow he became a great favourite with his fathers employer who was a sort of mecaenas to cudgel players boxers and horse jockies at his house thornton met many persons of rank but of a taste similar to their hosts and they mistaking his vulgar coarseness for honesty and his quaint proverbs for wit admitted him into their society it was with one of them that i have seen him i believe of late that his character has been of a very indifferent odour and whatever has brought him among the english at paristhose whitewashed abominationsthose innocent blacknesses as charles lamb calls chimney sweepers it does not argue well for his professional occupations i should think however that he manages to live here for wherever there are english fools there are fine pickings for an english rogue ay said i but are there enough fools here to feed the rogues yes because rogues are like spiders and eat each other when there is nothing else to catch and tom thornton is safe as long as the ordinary law of nature lasts that the greater knave preys on the lesser for there cannot possibly be a greater knave than he is if you have made his acquaintance my dear pelham i advise you most soberly to look to yourself for if he doth not steal beg or borrow of you mr howard de howard will grow fat and even mr aberton cease to be a fool and now most noble pelham farewell il est plus aise detre sage pour les autres que de letre pour soimeme </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxi this is a notable coupleand have met but for some secret knavery the tanner of tyburn i had now been several weeks in paris and i was not altogether dissatisfied with the manner in which they had been spent i had enjoyed myself to the utmost while i had as much as possible combined profit with pleasure viz if i went to the opera in the evening i learned to dance in the morning if i drove to a soiree at the duchesse de perpignans it was not till i had fenced an hour at the salon des assauts darmes and if i made love to the duchess herself it was sure to be in a position i had been a whole week in acquiring from my master of the graces in short i took the greatest pains to complete my education i wish all young men who frequented the continent for that purpose could say the same one day about a week after the conversation with vincent recorded in my last chapter i was walking slowly along one of the paths in the jardin des plantes meditating upon the various excellencies of the rocher de cancale and the duchesse de perpignan when i perceived a tall man with a thick rough coat of a dark colour which i recognized long before i did the face of the wearer emerging from an intersecting path he stopped for a few moments and looked round as if expecting some one presently a woman apparently about thirty and meanly dressed appeared in an opposite direction she approached him they exchanged a few words and then the woman taking his arm they struck into another path and were soon out of sight i suppose that the reader has already discovered that this man was thorntons companion in the bois de boulogne and the hero of the salon de jeu in the palais royal i could not have supposed that so noble a countenance even in its frowns could ever have wasted its smiles upon a mistress of that low station to which the woman who had met him evidently belonged however we all have our little foibles as the frenchman said when he boiled his grandmothers head in a pipkin i myself was at that time the sort of person that is always taken by a pretty face however coarse may be the garments which set it off and although i cannot say that i ever stooped so far as to become amorous of a chambermaid yet i could be tolerably lenient to any man under thirty who did as a proof of this gentleness of disposition ten minutes after i had witnessed so unsuitable a rencontre i found myself following a pretty little bourgeoise into a small sort of cabaret which was at the time i speak of and most probably still is in the midst of the gardens i sat down and called for my favourite drink of lemonade the little grisette who was with an old woman possibly her mother and un beau gros garcon probably her lover sat opposite and began with all the ineffable coquetries of her country to divide her attention between the said garcon and myself poor fellow he seemed to be very little pleased by the significant glances exchanged over his right shoulder and at last under pretence of screening her from the draught of the open window placed himself exactly between us this however ingenious did not at all answer his expectations for he had not sufficiently taken into consideration that i also was endowed with the power of locomotion accordingly i shifted my chair about three feet and entirely defeated the countermarch of the enemy but this flirtation did not last long the youth and the old woman appeared very much of the same opinion as to its impropriety and accordingly like experienced generals resolved to conquer by a retreat they drank up their orgeatpaid for itplaced the wavering regiment in the middle and left me master of the field i was not however of a disposition to break my heart at such an occurrence and i remained by the window drinking my lemonade and muttering to myself after all women are a great bore on the outside of the cabaret and just under my window was a bench which for a certain number of sous one might appropriate to the entire and unparticipated use of ones self and party an old woman so at least i suppose by her voice for i did not give myself the trouble of looking though indeed as to that matter it might have been the shrill treble of mr howard de howard had been hitherto engrossing this settlement with some gallant or other in paris no women are too old to get an amant either by love or money in a moment of tenderness this couple paired off and were immediately succeeded by another the first tones of the mans voice low as they were made me start from my seat i cast one quick glance before i resumed it the new pair were the englishman i had before noted in the garden and the female companion who had joined him two hundred pounds you say muttered the man we must have it all but said the woman in the same whispered voice he says that he will never touch another card the man laughed fool said he the passions are not so easily quelledhow many days is it since he had this remittance from england about three replied the woman and it is absolutely the very last remnant of his property the last i am then to understand that when this is spent there is nothing between him and beggary nothing said the woman with a half sigh the man laughed again and then rejoined in an altered tone then then will this parching thirst be quenched at last i tell you woman that it is many months since i have known a daynighthour in which my life has been as the life of other men my whole soul has been melted down into one burning burning thought feel this handay you may well startbut what is the fever of the frame to that within here the voice sunk so low as to be inaudible the woman seemed as if endeavouring to sooth him at length she saidbut poor tyrrellyou will not surely suffer him to die of actual starvation the man paused for a few moments and then repliednight and day i pray to god upon my bended knees only one unvarying unceasing prayer and that iswhen the last agonies shall be upon that manwhen sick with weariness pain disease hunger he lies down to diewhen the deathgurgle is in the throat and the eye swims beneath the last dull filmwhen remembrance peoples the chamber with hell and his cowardice would falter forth its dastard recantation to heaventhenmay i be there there was a long pause only broken by the womans sobs which she appeared endeavouring to stifle at last the man rose and in a tone so soft that it seemed literally like music addressed her in the most endearing terms she soon yielded to their persuasion and replied to them with interest spite of the stings of my remorse she said as long as i lose not you i will lose life honour hope even soul itself they both quitted the spot as she said this o that womans love how strong </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> strong is it in its weakness how beautiful in its guilt </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxii at length the treacherous snare was laid poor pug was caughtto town conveyd there sold how envied was his doom made captive in a ladys roomgays fables i was sitting alone a morning or two after this adventure when bedos entering announced une dame this dame was a fine tall thing dressed out like a print in the magasin des modes she sate herself down threw up her veil and after a momentary pause asked me if i liked my apartment very much said i somewhat surprised at the nature of the interrogatory perhaps you would wish it altered in some way rejoined the lady nonmille remercimens said iyou are very good to be so interested in my accommodation those curtains might be better arrangedthat sofa replaced with a more elegant one continued my new superintendant really said i i am too too much flattered perhaps you would like to have my rooms altogether if so make at least no scruple of saying it oh no replied the lady i have no objection to your staying here you are too kind said i with a low bow there was a pause of some momentsi took advantage of it i think madame i have the honour of speaking tototo the mistress of the hotel said the lady quietly i merely called to ask you how you did and hope you were well accommodated rather late considering i have been six weeks in the house thought i revolving in my mind various reports i had heard of my present visitors disposition to gallantry however seeing it was all over with me i resigned myself with the patience of a martyr to the fate that i foresaw i rose approached her chair took her hand very hard and thin it was too and thanked her with a most affectionate squeeze i have seen much english said the lady for the first time speaking in our language ah said i giving another squeeze you are handsome garcon renewed the lady i am so i replied at that moment bedos entered and whispered that madame danville was in the antiroom good heavens said i knowing her jealousy of disposition what is to be done oblige me madame seizing the unfortunate mistress of the hotel and opening the door to the back entrancethere said i you can easily escape bon jour hardly had i closed the door and put the key in my pocket before madame danville entered do you generally order your servants to keep me waiting in your antiroom said she haughtily not generally i replied endeavouring to make my peace but all my complaisance was in vainshe was jealous of my intimacy with the duchesse de perpignan and glad of any excuse to vent her pique i am just the sort of man to bear but never to forgive a womans ill temper vizit makes no impression on me at the time but leaves a sore recollection of something disagreeable which i internally resolve never again to experience madame danville was going to the luxembourg and my only chance of soothing her anger was to accompany her down stairs therefore we went and drove to the luxembourg i gave bedos before my departure various little commissions and told him he need not be at home till the evening long before the expiration of an hour madame danvilles ill humour had given me an excuse for affecting it myself tired to death of her and panting for release i took a high tonecomplained of her ill temper and her want of lovespoke rapidlywaited for no reply and leaving her at the luxembourg proceeded forthwith to galignanis like a man just delivered from a strait waistcoat leave me now for a few minutes in the readingroom at galignanis and return to the mistress of the hotel whom i had so unceremoniously thrust out of my salon the passage into which she had been put communicated by one door with my rooms and by another with the staircase now it had so happened that bedos was in the habit of locking the latter door and keeping the key the other egress it will be remembered i myself had secured so that the unfortunate mistress of the hotel was no sooner turned into this passage than she found herself in a sort of dungeon ten feet by five and surrounded like eve in paradise by a whole creationnot of birds beasts and fishes but of brooms brushes unclean linen and a woodbasket what she was to do in this dilemma was utterly inconceivable scream indeed she might but then the shame and ridicule of being discovered in so equivocal a situation were somewhat more than our discreet landlady could endure besides such an expose might be attended with a loss the good woman valued more than reputation viz lodgers for the possessors of the two best floors were both englishwomen of a certain rank and my landlady had heard such accounts of our national virtue that she feared an instantaneous emigration of such inveterate prudes if her screams and situation reached their ears quietly then and soberly did the good lady sit eyeing the brooms and brushes as they grew darker and darker with the approach of the evening and consoling herself with the certainty that her release must eventually take place meanwhile to return to myselffrom which dear little person i very seldom even in imagination digressi found lord vincent at galignanis carefully looking over choice extracts from the best english authors ah my good fellow said he i am delighted to see you i made such a capital quotation just now the young benningtons were drowning a poor devil of a puppy the youngest to whom the mother belonged looked on with a grave earnest face till the last kick was over and then burst into tears why do you cry so said i because it was so cruel in us to drown the poor puppy replied the juvenile philocunos pooh said i quid juvat errores mersa jam puppe fateri was it not goodyou remember it in claudian eh pelham think of its being thrown away on those latinless young lubbers have you seen any thing of mr thornton lately no said i ive not but i am determined to have that pleasure soon you will do as you please said vincent but you will be like the child playing with edged tools i am not a child said i so the simile is not good he must be the devil himself or a scotchman at least to take me in vincent shook his head come and dine with me at the rocher said he we are a party of sixchoice spirits all volontiers but we can stroll in the tuileries first if you have no other engagement none said vincent putting his arm in mine as we passed up the rue de la paix we met sir henry millington mounted on a bay horse as stiff as himself and cantering down the street as if he and his steed had been cut out of pasteboard together i wish said vincent to borrow luttrels quotation that that master of arts would cleanse his bosom of that perilous stuff i should like to know in what recess of that immense mass now cantering round the corner is the real body of sir henry millington i could fancy the poor snug little thing shrinking within like a guilty conscience ah well says juvenal mors sola fatetur quantula sint hominum corpuscula he has a superb head though i replied i like to allow that other people are handsome now and thenit looks generous yes said vincent for a barbers block but here comes mrs cme and her beautiful daughterthose are people you ought to know if you wish to see human nature a little relieved from the frivolities which make it in society so like a man milliner mrs chas considerable genius combined with great common sense a rare union said i by no means replied vincent it is a cant antithesis in opinion to oppose them to one another but so far as mere theoretical common sense is concerned i would much sooner apply to a great poet or a great orator for advice on matter of business than any dull plodder who has passed his whole life in a countinghouse common sense is only a modification of talentgenius is an exaltation of it the difference is therefore in the degree not nature but to return to mrs c she writes beautiful poetryalmost impromptu draws excellent caricatures possesses a laugh for whatever is ridiculous but never loses a smile for whatever is good placed in very peculiar situations she has passed through each with a grace and credit which make her best eulogium if she possesses one quality higher than intellect it is her kindness of heart no wonder indeed that she is so really cleverthose trees which are the soundest at the core produce the finest fruits and the most beautiful blossoms lord vincent grows poetical thought ihow very different he really is to that which he affects to be in the world but so it is with every onewe are all like the ancient actors let our faces be ever so beautiful we must still wear a mask after an hours walk vincent suddenly recollected that he had a commission of a very important nature in the rue j j rousseau this wasto buy a monkey it is for wormwood said he who has written me a long letter describing its qualities and qualifications i suppose he wants it for some practical jokesome embodied bitternessgod forbid i should thwart him in so charitable a design amen said i and we proceeded together to the monkeyfancier after much deliberation we at last decided upon the most hideous animal i ever beheldit was of ano i will not attempt to describe itit would be quite impossible vincent was so delighted with our choice that he insisted upon carrying it away immediately is it quite quiet i asked comme un oiseau said the man we called a fiacrepaid for monsieur jocko and drove to vincents apartments there we found however </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> however that his valet had gone out and taken the key hang it said vincent it does not signify well carry le petit monsieur with us to the rocher accordingly we all three once more entered the fiacre and drove to the celebrated restaurateurs of the rue mont orgueil o blissful recollections of that dinner how at this moment you crowd upon my delighted remembrance lonely and sorrowful as i now sit digesting with many a throe the iron thews of a british beefsteakmore anglicoimmeasurably toughi see the grateful apparitions of escallopes de saumon and laitances de carps rise in a gentle vapour before my eyes breathing a sweet and pleasant odour and contrasting the dreamlike delicacies of their hue and aspect with the dire and dure realities which now weigh so heavily on the region below my heart and thou most beautiful of allthou evening star of entremetsthou that delightest in truffles and gloriest in a dark cloud of saucesexquisite foiegrashave i forgotten thee do i not on the contrary see theesmell theetaste theeand almost die with rapture of thy possession what though the goose of which thou art a part has indeed been roasted alive by a slow fire in order to increase thy divine proportionsyet has not our almanachthe almanach des gourmandstruly declared that the goose rejoiced amid all her torturesbecause of the glory that awaited her did she not in prophetic vision behold her enlarged and ennobled foie dilate into pates and steam into sauteesthe companion of trufflesthe glory of dishesthe delightthe treasurethe transport of gourmands o exalted among birdsapotheosised goose did not thy heart exult even when thy liver parched and swelled within thee from that most agonizing death and didst thou not like the indian at the stake triumph in the very torments which alone could render thee illustrious after dinner we grew exceedingly merry vincent punned and quoted we laughed and applauded and our burgundy went round with an alacrity to which every new joke gave an additional impetus monsieur jocko was by no means the dullest in the party he cracked his nuts with as much grace as we did our jests and grinned and chatted as facetiously as the best of us after coffee we were all so pleased with one another that we resolved not to separate and accordingly we adjourned to my rooms jocko and all to find new revelries and grow brilliant over curacoa punch we entered my salon with a roar and set bedos to work at the punch forthwith bedos that ganymede of a valet had himself but just arrived and was unlocking the door as we entered we soon blew up a glorious fire and our spirits brightened in proportion monsieur jocko sate on vincents kneene monstrum as he classically termed it one of our compotatores was playing with it jocko grew suddenly in earnesta grina scratch and a bite were the work of a moment ne quid nimisnow said vincent gravely instead of endeavouring to soothe the afflicted party who grew into a towering passion nothing but jockos absolute disgrace could indeed have saved his life from the vengeance of the sufferer where shall we banish him said vincent oh i replied put him out in that back passage the outer door is shut hell be quite safe and to the passage he was therefore immediately consigned it was in this place the reader will remember that the hapless dame du chateau was at that very instant in durance vile bedos who took the condemned monkey opened the door thrust jocko in and closed it again meanwhile we resumed our merriment nunc est bibendum said vincent as bedos placed the punch on the table give us a toast dartmore lord dartmore was a young man with tremendous spirits which made up for wit he was just about to reply when a loud shriek was heard from jockos place of banishment a sort of scramble ensued and the next moment the door was thrown violently open and in rushed the terrified landlady screaming like a seagull and bearing jocko aloft upon her shoulders from which bad eminence he was grinning and chattering with the fury of fifty devils she ran twice round the room and then sunk on the floor in hysterics we lost no time in hastening to her assistance but the warlike jocko still sitting upon her refused to permit one of us to approach there he sat turning from side to side showing his sharp white teeth and uttering from time to time the most menacing and diabolical sounds what the deuce shall we do cried dartmore do said vincent who was convulsed with laughter and yet endeavouring to speak gravely why watch like l opimius ne quid respublica detrimenti caperet by jove pelham he will scratch out the ladys beaux yeux cried the goodnatured dartmore endeavouring to seize the monkey by the tail for which he very narrowly escaped with an unmutilated visage but the man who had before suffered by jockos ferocity and whose breast was still swelling with revenge was glad of so favourable an opportunity and excuse for wreaking it he seized the poker made three strides to jocko who set up an ineffable cry of defiance and with a single blow split the skull of the unhappy monkey in twain it fell with one convulsion on the ground and gave up the ghost we then raised the unfortunate landlady placed her on the sofa and dartmore administered a plentiful potation of the curacoa punch by slow degrees she revived gave three most doleful suspirations and then starting up gazed wildly around her half of us were still laughingmy unfortunate self among the number this the enraged landlady no sooner perceived than she imagined herself the victim of some preconcerted villainy her lips trembled with passionshe uttered the most dreadful imprecations and had i not retired into a corner and armed myself with the dead body of jocko which i wielded with exceeding valour she might with the simple weapons with which nature had provided her hands have for ever demolished the loves and graces that abide in the face of henry pelham when at last she saw that nothing hostile was at present to be effected she drew herself up and giving bedos a tremendous box on the ear as he stood grinning beside her marched out of the room we then again rallied around the table more than ever disposed to be brilliant and kept up till day break a continued fire of jests upon the heroine of the passage cum qua as vincent observed clauditur adversis innoxia simia fatis </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxiii show me not thy painted beauties these impostures i defygeorge withers the cave of falri smelt not more delicatelyon every side appeared the marks of drunkenness and gluttony at the upper end of the cave the sorcerer lay extended etcmirglip the persian in the tales of the genii i woke the next morning with an aching head and feverish frame ah those midnight carousals how glorious they would be if there was no next morning i took my sauterne and sodawater in my dressingroom and as indisposition always makes me meditative i thought over all i had done since my arrival at paris i had become that god knows i soon manage to do rather a talked of and noted character it is true that i was every where abusedone found fault with my neckclothanother with my mindthe lank mr aberton declared that i put my hair in papers and the stuffed sir henry millington said i was a threadpaper myself one blamed my ridinga second my dancinga third wondered how any woman could like me and a fourth said that no woman ever could on one point however allfriends and foeswere alike agreed viz that i was a consummate puppy and excessively well satisfied with myself a la verite they were not much mistaken there why is it by the by that to be pleased with onesself is the surest way of offending every body else if any one male or female an evident admirer of his or her own perfections enter a room how perturbed restless and unhappy every individual of the offenders sex instantly becomes for them not only enjoyment but tranquillity is over and if they could annihilate the unconscious victim of their spleen i fully believe no christian toleration would come in the way of that last extreme of animosity for a coxcomb there is no mercyfor a coquet no pardon they are as it were the dissenters of societyno crime is too bad to be imputed to them they do not believe the religion of othersthey set up a deity of their own vanityall the orthodox vanities of others are offended then comes the bigotrythe stakethe autodafe of scandal what alas is so implacable as the rage of vanity what so restless as its persecution take from a man his fortune his house his reputation but flatter his vanity in each and he will forgive you heap upon him benefits fill him with blessings but irritate his selflove and you have made the very best man an ingrat he will sting you if he can you cannot blame him you yourself have instilled the venom this is one reason why you must not always reckon upon gratitude in conferring an obligation it is a very high mind to which gratitude is not a painful sensation if you wish to please you will find it wiser to receivesolicit evenfavours than accord them for the vanity of the obliger is always flatteredthat of the obligee rarely well this is an unforeseen digression let me return i had mixed of late very little with the english my mothers introductions had procured me the entree of the best french houses and to them therefore my evenings were usually devoted alas that was a happy time when my carriage used to await me at the door of the rocher de cancale and then whirl me to a succession of visits varying in their degree and nature as the whim prompted now to the brilliant soirees of madame de or to the appartemens au troisieme of some less celebrated daughter of dissipation and ecartenow to the literary conversaziones of </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> of the duchesse de ds or the vicomte da and then to the feverish excitement of the gambling house passing from each with the appetite for amusement kept alive by variety finding in none a disappointment and in every one a welcome full of the health which supports and the youth which colours all excess or excitation i drained with an unsparing lip whatever that enchanting metropolis could afford i have hitherto said but little of the duchesse de perpignan i think it necessary now to give some account of that personage ever since the evening i had met her at the ambassadors i had paid her the most unceasing attentions i soon discovered that she had a curious sort of liaison with one of the attachesa short illmade gentleman with high shoulders and a pale face who wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat wrote bad verses and thought himself handsome all paris said she was excessively enamoured of this youth as for me i had not known her four days before i discovered that she could not be excessively enamoured of any thing but an oyster pete and lord byrons corsair her mind was the most marvellous melange of sentiment and its opposite in her amours she was lucretia herself in her epicurism apicius would have yielded to her she was pleased with sighs but she adored suppers she would leave every thing for her lover except her dinner the attache soon quarrelled with her and i was installed into the platonic honours of his office at first i own that i was flattered by her choice and though she was terribly exigeante of my petits soins i managed to keep up her affection and what is still more wonderful my own for the better part of a month what then cooled me was the following occurrence i was in her boudoir one evening when her femme de chambre came to tell us that the duc was in the passage notwithstanding the innocence of our attachment the duchesse was in a violent fright a small door was at the left of the ottoman on which we were sitting oh no no not there cried the lady but i who saw no other refuge entered it forthwith and before she could ferret me out the duc was in the room in the meanwhile i amused myself by examining the wonders of the new world into which i had so abruptly immerged on a small table before me was deposited a remarkably constructed nightcap i examined it as a curiosity on each side was placed une petite cotelette de veau cru sewed on with greencoloured silk i remember even the smallest minutiae a beautiful golden wig the duchesse never liked me to play with her hair was on a block close by and on another table was a set of teeth dune blancheur eblouissante in this manufactory of a beauty i remained for a quarter of an hour at the end of that time the abigail the duchesse had the grace to disappear released me and i flew down stairs like a spirit from purgatory from that moment the duchesse honoured me with her most deadly abhorrence equally silly and wicked her schemes of revenge were as ludicrous in their execution as remorseless in their design at one time i narrowly escaped poison in a cup of coffeeat another she endeavoured to stab me to the heart with a paper cutter notwithstanding my preservation from these attacks this new messalina had resolved on my destruction and another means of attempting it still remained which the reader will yet have the pleasure of learning mr thornton had called upon me twice and twice i had returned the visit but neither of us had been at home to benefit by these reciprocities of politesse his acquaintance with my mysterious hero of the gambling house and the jardin des plantes and the keen interest i took in spite of myself in that unaccountable person whom i was persuaded i had seen before in some very different scene and under very different circumstances made me desirous to increase a connoissance which from vincents detail i should otherwise have been anxious to avoid i therefore resolved to make another attempt to find him at home and my headache being somewhat better i took my way to his apartments in the faubourg st germain i love that quartierif ever i went to paris again i should reside there it is quite a different world from the streets usually known to and tenanted by the englishthere indeed you are among the french the fossilized remains of the old regimethe very houses have an air of desolate yet venerable grandeuryou never pass by the white and modern mansion of a nouveau riche all even to the ruggedness of the pave breathes a haughty disdain of innovationyou cross one of the numerous bridges and you enter into another timeyou are inhaling the atmosphere of a past century no flaunting boutique french in its trumpery english in its prices stares you in the face no stiff coats and unnatural gaits are seen anglicising up the melancholy streets vast hotels with their gloomy frontals and magnificent contempt of comfort shops such as shops might have been in the aristocratic days of louis quatorze ere british vulgarities made them insolent and dear public edifices still redolent of the superb charities of le grand monarquecarriages with their huge bodies and ample decorations horses with their norman dimensions and undocked honours men on whose more high though not less courteous demeanour the revolution seems to have wrought no democratic plebeianismall strike on the mind with a vague and nameless impression of antiquity a something solemn even in gaiety and faded in pomp appear to linger over all you behold there are the great french people unadulterated by change unsullied with the commerce of the vagrant and various tribes that throng their mighty mart of enjoyments the strangers who fill the quartiers on this side the seine pass not there between them and the faubourg there is a gulf the very skies seem differentyour own feelings thoughtsnature itselfalter when you have passed that styx which divides the wanderers from the habitants your spirits are not so much damped as tinged refined ennobled by a certain inexpressible aweyou are girt with the stateliness of eld and you tread the gloomy streets with the dignity of a man who is recalling the splendours of an ancient court where he once did homage i arrived at thorntons chambers in the rue st dominique monsieur estil chez lui said i to the ancient porteress who was reading one of crebillons novels oui monsieur au quatrieme was the answer i turned to the dark and unclean staircase and after incredible exertion and fatigue arrived at last at the elevated abode of mr thornton entrez cried a voice in answer to my rap i obeyed the signal and found myself in a room of tolerable dimensions and multiplied utilities a decayed silk curtain of a dingy blue drawn across a recess separated the chambre a coucher from the salon it was at present only half drawn and did not therefore conceal the mysteries of the den within the bed was still unmade and apparently of no very inviting cleanliness a red handkerchief that served as a nightcap hung pendant from the foot of the bed at a little distance from it more towards the pillow were a shawl a parasol and an old slipper on a table which stood between the two dull filmy windows were placed a cracked bowl still reeking with the less of ginpunch two bottles half full a mouldy cheese and a salad dish on the ground beneath it lay two huge books and a womans bonnet thornton himself sat by a small consumptive fire in an easy chair another table still spread with the appliances of breakfast viz a coffeepot a milkjug two cups a broken loaf and an empty dish mingled with a pack of cards one dice and an open book de mauvais gout stood immediately before him every thing around bore some testimony of the spirit of low debauchery and the man himself with his flushed and sensual countenance his unwashed hands and the slovenly rakishness of his whole appearance made no unfitting representation of the genius loci all that i have described together with a flitting shadow of feminine appearance escaping through another door my quick eye discovered in the same instant that i made my salutation thornton rose with an air half careless and half abashed and expressed in more appropriate terms than his appearance warranted his pleasurable surprise at seeing me at last there was however a singularity in his conversation which gave it an air both of shrewdness and vulgarity this was as may before have been noted a profuse intermixture of proverbs some stale some new some sensible enough and all savouring of a vocabulary carefully eschewed by every man of ordinary refinement in conversation i have but a small tenement said he smiling but thank heaven at paris a man is not made by his lodgings small house small care few garcons have indeed a more sumptuous apartment than myself true said i and if i may judge by the bottles on the opposite table and the bonnet beneath it you find that no abode is too humble or too exalted for the solace of the senses fore gad you are in the right mr pelham replied thornton with a loud coarse chuckling laugh which more than a years conversation could have done let me into the secrets of his character i care not a rush for the decorations of the table so that the cheer be good nor for the gewgaws of the headdress as long as the face is prettythe taste of the kitchen is better than the smell do you go much to madame bs ion the rue gretryeh mr pelhamah ill be bound you do no said i with a loud laugh but internal shiver but you know where to find le bon vin et les jolies filles as for me i am still a stranger in paris and amuse myself but very indifferently thorntons face brightened i </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> i tell you what my good felli beg pardoni mean mr pelhami can shew you the best sport in the world if you can only spare me a little of your timethis very evening perhaps i fear said i i am engaged all the present week but i long for nothing more than to cultivate an acquaintance seemingly so exactly to my own taste thorntons grey eyes twinkled will you breakfast with me on sunday said he i shall be too happy i replied there was now a short pause i took advantage of it i think said i i have seen you once or twice with a tall handsome man in a loose great coat of very singular colour pray if not impertinent who is he i am sure i have seen him before in england i looked full upon thornton as i said this he changed colour and answered my gaze with a quick glance from his small glittering eye before he replied i scarcely know who you mean my acquaintance is so large and miscellaneous at paris it might have been johnson or smith or howard or any body in short it is a man nearly six feet high said i thin and remarkably well made of a pale complexion light eyes and very black hair mustachios and whiskers i saw him with you once in the bois de boulogne and once in a hell in the palais royal surely now you will recollect who he is thornton was evidently disconcerted oh said he after a short pause and another of his peculiarly quick sly glancesoh that man i have known him a very short time what is his name let me see and mr thornton affected to look down in a complete reverie of dim remembrances i saw however that from time to time his eye glanced up to me with a restless inquisitive expression and as instantly retired ah said i carelessly i think i know who he is who cried thornton eagerly and utterly off his guard and yet i pursued without noticing the interruption it scarcely can bethe colour of the hair is so very different thornton again appeared to relapse into his recollections warwarburah i have it now cried he warburtonthats itthats the nameis it the one you supposed mr pelham no said i apparently perfectly satisfied i was quite mistaken good morning i did not think it was so late on sunday then mr thorntonau plaisir a dd cunning dog said i to myself as i left the apartments however on peutetre trop fin i shall have him yet the surest way to make a dupe is to let you victim suppose you are his </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxiv voila de leruditionles femmes savantes i found on my return covered with blood and foaming with passion my inestimable valetbedos whats the matter said i matter repeated bedos in a tone almost inarticulate with rage and then rejoicing at the opportunity of unbosoming his wrath he poured out a vast volley of ivrognes and carognes against our dame du chateau of monkey reminiscence with great difficulty i gathered at last from his vituperations that the enraged landlady determined to wreak her vengeance on some one had sent for him into her appartment accosted him with a smile bade him sit down regaled him with cold volauvent and a glass of curacoa and while he was felicitating himself on his good fortune slipped out of the room presently three tall fellows entered with sticks well teach you said the biggest of themwell teach you to lock up ladies for the indulgence of your vulgar amusement and without one other word they fell upon bedos with incredible zeal and vigour the valiant valet defended himself tooth and nail for some time for which he only got the more soundly belaboured in the meanwhile the landlady entered and with the same gentle smile as before begged him to make no ceremony to proceed with his present amusement and when he was tired with the exercise hoped he would refresh himself with another glass of curacoa it was this said bedos with a whimper which hurt me the most to think she should serve me so cruelly after i had eaten so plentifully of the volauvent envy and injustice i can bear but treachery stabs me to the heart when these threshers of men were tired the lady satisfied and bedos half dead they suffered the unhappy valet to withdraw the mistress of the hotel giving him a note which she desired with great civility that he would transmit to me on my return this i found inclosed my bill and informed me that my month being out on the morrow she was unwilling to continue me any longer and begged i would therefore have the bonte to choose another apartment carry my luggage forthwith said i to the hotel de mirabeau and that very evening i changed my abode i am happy in the opportunity this incident affords me of especially recommending the hotel de mirabeau rue de la paix to any of my countrymen who are really gentlemen and will not disgrace my recommendation it is certainly the best caravansera in the english quartier i was engaged that day to a literary dinner at the marquis dal and as i knew i should meet vincent i felt some pleasure in repairing to my entertainers hotel they were just going to dinner as i entered a good many english were of the party the good natured in all senses of the word lady who always affected to pet me cried aloud pelham mon joli petit mignon i have not seen you for an agedo give me your arm madame danville was just before me and as i looked at her i saw that her eyes were full of tears my heart smote me for my late inattention and going up to her i only nodded to lady and said in reply to her invitation non perfide it is my turn to be cruel now remember your flirtation with mr howard de howard pooh said lady taking lord vincents arm your jealousy does indeed rest upon a trifle light as air do you forgive me whispered i to madame danville as i handed her to the salle a manger does not love forgive every thing was her answer at least thought i it never talks in those pretty phrases the conversation soon turned upon books as for me i never at that time took a share in those discussions indeed i have long laid it down as a rule that a man never gains by talking to more than one person at a time if you dont shine you are a foolif you do you are a bore you must become either ridiculous or unpopulareither hurt your own selflove by stupidity or that of others by wit i therefore sat in silence looking exceedingly edified and now and then muttering good true thank heaven however the suspension of one faculty only increases the vivacity of the others my eyes and ears always watch like sentinels over the repose of my lips careless and indifferent as i seem to all things nothing ever escapes me the minutest erreur in a dish or a domestic the most trifling peculiarity in a criticism or a coat my glance detects in an instant and transmits for ever to my recollection you have seen jouys hermite de la chaussee dantin said our host to lord vincent i have and think meanly of it there is a perpetual aim at something pointed which as perpetually merges into something dull he is like a bad swimmer strikes out with great force makes a confounded splash and never gets a yard the further for it it is a great effort not to sink indeed monsieur da your literature is at a very reduced ebb bombastic in the dramashallow in philosophymawkish in poetry your writers of the present day seem to think with boileau souvent de tous nos maux la raison est le pire surely cried madame danville you will allow de la martines poetry to be beautiful i allow it said he to be among the best you have and i know very few lines in your language equal to the two first stanzas in his meditation on napoleon or to those exquisite verses called le lac but you will allow also that he wants originality and nerve his thoughts are pathetic but not deep he whines but sheds no tears he has in his imitation of lord byron reversed the great miracle instead of turning water into wine he has turned wine into water besides he is so unpardonably obscure he thinks with bacchusyou remember da the line in euripides which i will not quote that there is something august in the shades but he has applied this thought wronglyin his obscurity there is nothing sublimeit is the back ground of a dutch picture it is only a red herring or an old hat which he has invested with such pomposity of shadow and darkness but his verses are so smooth said lady ah answered vincent quand la rime enfin se trouve au bout des vers quimporte que le reste y soit mis des travers helas said the viscount dat an author of no small celebrity himself i agree with youwe shall never again see a voltaire or a rousseau there is but little justice in those complaints often as they are made replied vincent you may not it is true see a voltaire or a rousseau but you will see their equals genius can never be exhausted by one individual in our country the poets after chaucer in the fifteenth century complained of the decay of their artthey did not anticipate shakspeare in hayleys time who ever dreamt of the ascension of byron yet shakspeare and byron came like the bridegroom in the dead of night and you have the same probability of producingnot indeed another rousseau but a writer to do equal honour to your literature i think said lady that rousseaus julie is overrated i had heard so much of la nouvelle heloise when i was a girl and been so often told that it was destruction </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> destruction to read it that i bought the book the very day after i was married i own to you that i could not get through it i am not surprised at it answered vincent but rousseau is not the less a genius for all that there is no story to bear out the style and he himself is right when he says ce livre convient a tres peu de lecteurs one letter would delight every onefour volumes of them are a surfeitit is the toujours perdrix but the chief beauty of that wonderful conception of an empassioned and meditative mind is to be found in the inimitable manner in which the thoughts are embodied and in the tenderness the truth the profundity of the thoughts themselves when lord edouard says cest le chemin des passions qui ma conduit a la philosophie he inculcates in one simple phrase a profound and unanswerable truth it is in these remarks that nature is chiefly found in the writings of rousseau too much engrossed in himself to be deeply skilled in the characters of others that very selfstudy had yet given him a knowledge of the more hidden recesses of the heart he could perceive at once the motive and the cause of actions but he wanted the patience to trace the elaborate and winding progress of their effects he saw the passions in their home but he could not follow them abroad he knew mankind in the general but not men in the detail thus when he makes an aphorism or reflection it comes home at once to you as true but when he would analyze that reflection when he argues reasons and attempts to prove you reject him as unnatural or you refute him as false it is then that he partakes of that manie commune which he imputes to other philosophers de nier ce qui est et dexpliquer ce qui nest pas there was a short pause i think said madame danville that it is in those pensees which you admire so much in rousseau that our authors in general excel you are right said vincent and for this reasonwith you les gens de letters are always les gens du monde hence their quick perceptions are devoted to men as well as to books they make observations acutely and embody them with grace but it is worth remarking that the same cause which produced the aphorism frequently prevents its being profound these literary gens du monde have the tact to observe but not the patience perhaps not the time to investigate they make the maxim but they never explain to you the train of reasoning which led to it hence they are more brilliant than true an english writer would not dare to make a maxim involving perhaps in two lines one of the most important of moral truths without bringing pages to support his dictum a french essayist leaves it wholly to itself he tells you neither how he came by his reasons nor their conclusion le plus fou souvent est le plus satisfait consequently if less tedious than the english your reasoners are more dangerous and ought rather to be considered as models of terseness than of reflection a man might learn to think sooner from your writers but he will learn to think justly sooner from ours many

french line in corneille ma plus douce esperance est de perdre lespoir the maquis took advantage of the silence which followed vincents criticism to rise from table we all except vincent who took leave adjourned to the salon qui est cet homme la said one comme il est epris de luimeme how silly he is cried anotherhow ugly said a third what a taste in literaturesuch a talkersuch shallowness and such assurancenot worth the answeringcould not slip in a worddisagreeable revolting awkward slovenly were the most complimentary opinions bestowed upon the unfortunate vincent the women called him un horreur and the men un bete the old railed at his mauvais gout and the young at his mauvais coeur for the former always attribute whatever does not correspond with their sentiments to a perversion of taste and the latter whatever does not come up to their enthusiasm to a depravity of heart as for me i went home enriched with two new observations first that one may not speak of any thing relative to a foreign country as one would if one was a native national censures become particular affronts secondly that those who know mankind in theory seldom know it in practice the very wisdom that conceives a rule is accompanied with the abstraction or the vanity which destroys it i mean that the philosopher of the cabinet is often too diffident to put into action his observations or too eager for display to conceal their design lord vincent values himself upon his science du monde he has read much upon men he has reflected more he lays down aphorisms to govern or to please them he goes into society he is cheated by the one half and the other half he offends the sage in the cabinet is but a fool in the salon and the most consummate men of the world are those who have considered the

<chapter>chapter xxv falstaff what money is in my purse page seven groats and twopence second part of henry iv en iterum crispinus the next day a note was brought me which had been sent to my former lodgings in the hotel de paris it was from thornton my dear sir it began i am very sorry that particular business will prevent me the pleasure of seeing you at my rooms on sunday i hope to be more fortunate some other day i should like much to introduce you the first opportunity to my friends in the rue gretry for i like obliging my countrymen i am sure if you were to go there you would cut and come againone shoulder of mutton drives down another i beg you to accept my repeated excuses and remain dear sir your very obedient servant thomas thornton rue st dominique friday morning this letter produced in me many and manifold cogitations what could possibly have induced mr tom thornton rogue as he was to postpone thus of his own accord the plucking of a pigeon which he had such good reason to believe he had entrapped there was evidently no longer the same avidity to cultivate my acquaintance as before in putting off our appointment with so little ceremony he did not even fix a day for another what had altered his original designs towards me for if vincents account was true it was natural to suppose that he wished to profit by any acquaintance he might form with me and therefore such an acquaintance his own interests would induce him to continue and confirm either then he no longer had the same necessity for a dupe or he no longer imagined i should become one yet neither of these suppositions was probable it was not likely that he should grow suddenly honest or suddenly rich nor had i on the other hand given him any reason to suppose i was a jot more wary than any other individual he might have imposed upon on the contrary i had appeared to seek his acquaintance with an eagerness which said but little for my knowledge of the world the more i reflected the more i should have been puzzled had i not connected his present backwardness with his acquaintance with the stranger whom he termed warburton it is true that i had no reason to suppose so it was a conjecture wholly unsupported and indeed against my better sense yet from some unanalysed associations i could not divest myself of the supposition i will soon see thought i and wrapping myself in my cloak for the day was bitterly cold i bent my way to thorntons lodgings i could not explain to myself the deep interest i took in whatever was connected with the socalled warburton or whatever promised to discover more clearly any particulars respecting him his behaviour in the gambling house his conversation with the woman in the jardin des plantes and the singular circumstance that a man of so very aristocratic an appearance should be connected with thornton and only seen in such low scenes and with such low society would not have been sufficient so strongly to occupy my mind had it not been for certain dim recollections and undefinable associations that his appearance when present and my thoughts of him when absent perpetually recalled as engrossed with meditations of this nature i was passing over the pont neuf i perceived the man warburton had so earnestly watched in the gambling house and whom i identified with the tyrrell who had formed the subject of conversation in the jardin des plantes pass slowly before me there was an appearance of great exhaustion in his swarthy and strongly marked countenance he walked carelessly on neither looking to the right nor the left with that air of thought and abstraction which i have remarked as common to all men in the habit of indulging any engrossing and exciting passion we were just on the other side of the seine when i perceived the woman of the jardin des plantes approach tyrrell for that i afterwards discovered was really his name started as she came near and asked her in a tone of some asperity where she had been as i was but a few paces behind i had a clear full view of the womans countenance she was about twentyeight or thirty years of age her features were decidedly handsome though somewhat too sharp and aquiline for my individual taste her eyes were light and rather sunken and her complexion bespoke somewhat of the paleness and languor of illhealth on the whole the expression of her face though decided was not unpleasing and when she returned tyrrells rather rude salutation it was with a smile which made her for the moment absolutely beautiful where have i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> i been to she said in answer to his interrogatory why i went to look at the new church which they told me was so superbe methinks replied the man that ours are not precisely the circumstances in which such spectacles are amusing nay tyrrell said the woman as taking his arm they walked on together a few paces before me nay we are quite rich now to what we have been and if you do play again our two hundred pounds may swell into a fortune your losses have brought you skill and you may now turn them into actual advantages tyrrell did not reply exactly to these remarks but appeared as if debating with himself two hundred poundstwenty already gonein a few months all will have melted away what is it then now but a respite from starvationbut with luck it may become a competence and why not have luck many a fortune has been made with a worse beginning said the woman true margaret pursued the gambler and even without luck our fate can only commence a month or two soonerbetter a short doom than a lingering torture what think you of trying some new game where you have more experience or where the chances are greater than in that of rouge et noir asked the woman could you not make something out of that tall handsome man who thornton says is so rich ah if one could sighed tyrrell wistfully thornton tells me that he has won thousands from him and that they are mere drops in his income thornton is a good easy careless fellow and might let me into a share of the booty but then in what games can i engage him here i passed this wellsuited pair and lost the remainder of their conversation well thought i if this precious personage does starve at last he will most richly deserve it partly for his designs on the stranger principally for his opinion of thornton if he was a knave only one might pity him but a knave and fool both are a combination of evil for which there is no intermediate purgatory of opinionnothing short of utter damnation i soon arrived at mr thorntons abode the same old woman poring over the same novel of crebillon made me the same reply as before and accordingly again i ascended the obscure and rugged stairs which seemed to indicate that the road to vice is not so easy as one generally supposes i knocked at the door and receiving no answering acknowledgment opened it at once the first thing i saw was the dark rough coat of warburtonthat persons back was turned to me and he was talking with some energy to thornton who lounged idly in his chair with one ungartered leg thrown over the elbow ah mr pelham exclaimed the latter starting from his not very graceful position it gives me great pleasure to see youmr warburton mr pelhammr pelham mr warburton my newmade and mysterious acquaintance drew himself up to his full height and bowed very slightly to my own acknowledgment of the introduction a low person would have thought him rude i only supposed him ignorant of the world no real gentleman is uncivil he turned round after this stiff condescension de sa part and sunk down on the sofa with his back towards me i was mistaken thought i when i believed him to be above such associates as thorntonthey are well matched my dear sir said thornton i am very sorry i could not see you to breakfasta particular engagement prevented meverbum sap mr pelham you take me i supposeblack eyes white skin and such an ancle and the fellow rubbed his great hands and chuckled well said i i cannot blame you whatever may be my lossa dark eye and a straight ancle are powerful excuses what says mr warburton to them and i turned to the object of my interrogatory really he answered drily and without moving from his uncourteous position mr thornton only can judge of the niceties of his peculiar tastes or the justice of his general excuses mr warburton said this in a sarcastic bitter tone thornton bit his lip more i should think at the manner than the words and his small grey eyes sparkled with a malignant and stern expression which suited the character of his face far better than the careless levity and enjouement which his glances usually denoted they are no such great friends after all thought i and now let me change my attack pray i asked among all your numerous acquaintances at paris did you ever meet with a mr tyrrell warburton started from his chair and as instantly reseated himself thornton eyed me with one of those peculiar looks which so strongly reminded me of a dog in deliberation whether to bite or run away i do know a mr tyrrell he said after a short pause what sort of a person is he i asked with an indifferent aira great gamester is he not he does slap it down on the colours now and then replied thornton i hope you dont know him mr pelham why said i evading the question his character is not affected by a propensity so common unless indeed you suppose him to be more a gambler than a gamester viz more acute than unlucky god forbid that i should say any such thing replied thornton you wont catch an old lawyer in such imprudence the greater the truth the greater the libel said warburton with a sneer no resumed thornton i know nothing against mr tyrrellnothing he may be a very good man and i believe he is but as a friend mr pelham and mr thornton grew quite affectionate i advise you to have as little as possible to do with that sort of people truly said i you have now excited my curiosity nothing you know is half so inviting as mystery thornton looked as if he had expected a very different reply and warburton said in an abrupt tonewhoever enters an unknown road in a fog may easily lose himself true said i but that very chance is more agreeable than a road where one knows every tree danger and novelty are more to my taste than safety and sameness besides as i never gamble myself i can lose nothing by an acquaintance with those who do another pause ensuedand finding i had got all from mr thornton and his uncourteous guest that i was likely to do i took my hat and my departure i do not know thought i whether i have profited much by this visit let me consider in the first place i have not ascertained why i was put off by mr thorntonfor as to his excuse it could only have availed one day and had he been anxious for my acquaintance he would have named another i have however discovered first that he does not wish me to form any connection with tyrrell secondly from warburtons sarcasm and his glance of reply that there is but little friendship between those two whatever be the intimacy and thirdly that warburton from his dorsal positions so studiously preserved either wished to be uncivil or unnoticed the latter after all was the most probable and upon the whole i felt more than ever convinced that he was the person i suspected him to be </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxvi tell how the fates my giddy course did guide the inconstant turns of every changing hourpierce gaveston by m drayton je me retire doncadieu paris adieuboileau when i returned home i found on my table the following letter from my mother my dear henry i am rejoiced to hear you are so well entertained at paristhat you have been so often to the ds and cs that coulon says you are his best pupilthat your favourite horse is so much admiredand that you have only exceeded your allowance by a l1000 with some difficulty i have persuaded your uncle to transmit you an order for l1500 which will i trust make up all your deficiencies you must not my dear child be so extravagant for the future and for a very good reason namely i do not see how you can your uncle i fear will not again be so generous and your father cannot assist you you will therefore see more clearly than ever the necessity of marrying an heiress there are only two in england the daughters of gentlemen worthy of youthe most deserving of these has l10000 a year the other has l150000 the former is old ugly and very ill tempered the latter tolerably pretty and agreeable and just of age but you will perceive the impropriety of even thinking of her till we have tried the other i am going to ask both to my sunday soirees where i never admit any single men so that there at least you will have no rivals and now my dear son before i enter into a subject of great importance to you i wish to recal to your mind that pleasure is never an end but a meansviz that in your horses and amusements at parisyour visits and your liaisonsyou have always i trust remembered that these were only so far desirable as the methods of shining in society i have now a new scene on which you are to enter with very different objects in view and where any pleasures you may find have nothing the least in common with those you at present enjoy i know that this preface will not frighten you as it might many silly young men your education has been too carefully attended to for you to imagine that any step can be rough or unpleasant which raises you in the world to come at once to the point one of the seats in your uncles borough of buyemall is every day expected to be vacated the present member mr toolington cannot possibly live a week and your uncle is very desirous that you should fill the vacancy which mr toolingtons death will create though i called it lord glenmorriss borough yet it is not entirely at his disposal which i think very strange </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> strange since my father who was not half so rich as your uncle could send two members to parliament without the least trouble in the worldbut i dont understand these matters possibly your uncle poor man does not manage them well however he says no time is to be lost you are to return immediately to england and come down to his house inshire it is supposed you will have some contest but be certain eventually to come in you will also in this visit to lord glenmorris have an excellent opportunity of securing his affection you know it is some time since he saw you and the greater part of his property is unentailed if you come into the house you must devote yourself wholly to it and i have no fear of your succeeding for i remember when you were quite a child how well you spoke my name is norval and romans countrymen and lovers i heard mr canning speak the other day and i think his voice is quite like yours in short i make no doubt of seeing you in the ministry in a very few years you see my dear son that it is absolutely necessary you should set out immediately you will call on lady and you will endeavour to make firm friends of the most desirable among your present acquaintance so that you may be on the same footing you are now should you return to paris this a little civility will easily do nobody as i before observed except in england ever loses by politeness by the by that last word is one you must never use it is too gloucesterplace like you will also be careful in returning to england to make very little use of french phrases no vulgarity is more unpleasing i could not help being exceedingly amused by a book written the other day which professes to give an accurate description of good society not knowing what to make us say in english the author has made us talk nothing but french i have often wondered what common people think of us since in their novels they always affect to pourtray us so different from themselves i am very much afraid we are in all things exactly like them except in being more simple and unaffected the higher the rank indeed the less pretence because there is less to pretend to this is the chief reason why our manners are better than low persons ours are more natural because they imitate no one else theirs are affected because they think to imitate ours and whatever is evidently borrowed becomes vulgar original affection is sometimes tonimitated affectation always bad well my dear henry i must now conclude this letter already too long to be interesting i hope to see you about ten days after you receive this and if you could bring me a cachemire shawl it would give me great pleasure to see your taste in its choice god bless you my dear son your very affectionate frances pelham ps i hope you go to church sometimes i am sorry to see the young men of the present day so irreligious perhaps you could get my old friend madame de to choose the cachemiretake care of your health this letter which i read carefully twice over threw me into a most serious meditation my first feeling was regret at leaving paris my second was a certain exultation at the new prospects so unexpectedly opened to me the great aim of a philosopher is to reconcile every disadvantage by some counterbalance of goodwhere he cannot create this he should imagine it i began therefore to consider less what i should lose than what i should gain by quitting paris in the first place i was tolerably tired of its amusements no business is half so fatiguing as pleasure i longed for a change behold a change was at hand then to say truth i was heartily glad of a pretence of escaping from a numerous cohort of folles amours with madame danville at the head and the very circumstance which men who play the german flute and fall in love would have considered the most vexatious i regarded as the most consolatory there was yet another reason which reconciled me more than any other to my departure i had in my residence at paris among half wits and whole roues contracted a certainnot exactly grossieretebut want of refinementa certain coarseness of expression and idea which though slight and easily thrown off took in some degree from my approach to that character which i wished to become i know nothing which would so polish the manners as continental intercourse were it not for the english debauches with which that intercourse connects one english profligacy is always coarse and in profligacy nothing is more contagious than its tone one never keeps a restraint on the manner when one unbridles the passions and one takes from the associates with whom the latter are indulged the air and the method of the indulgence i was the reader well knows too solicitous for improvement not to be anxious to escape from such chances of deterioration and i therefore consoled myself with considerable facility for the pleasures and the associates i was about to forego my mind being thus relieved from all regret at my departure i now suffered it to look forward to the advantages of my return to england my love of excitement and variety made an election in which i was to have both the importance of the contest and the certainty of the success a very agreeable object of anticipation i was also by this time wearied with my attendance upon women and eager to exchange it for the ordinary objects of ambition to men and my vanity whispered that my success in the one was no unfavourable omen of my prosperity in the other on my return to england with a new scene and a new motive for conduct i resolved that i would commence a different character to that i had hitherto assumed how far i kept this resolution the various events hereafter to be shown will testify for myself i felt that i was now about to enter a more crowded scene upon a more elevated ascent and my previous experience of human nature was sufficient to convince me that my safety required a more continual circumspection and my success a more dignified bearing </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxvii je noterai cela madame dans mon livremoliere i am not one of those persons who are many days in deciding what may be effected in one on the third day from this said i to bedos at half past nine in the morning i shall leave paris for england oh my poor wife said the valet she will break her heart if i leave her then stay said i bedos shrugged his shoulders i prefer being with monsieur to all things what even to your wife the courteous rascal placed his hand to his heart and bowed you shall not suffer by your fidelityyou shall take your wife with you the conjugal valets countenance fell no he said no he could not take advantage of monsieurs generosity i insist upon itnot another word i beg a thousand pardons of monsieur butbut my wife is very ill and unable to travel then in that case so excellent a husband cannot think of leaving a sick and destitute wife poverty has no law if i consulted my heart and stayed i should starve et il faut vivre je nen vois pas la necessite replied i as i got into my carriage that repartee by the way i cannot claim as my own it is the very unanswerable answer of a judge to an expostulating thief i made the round of reciprocal regrets according to the orthodox formula the duchesse de perpignan was the lastmadame danville i reserved for another daythat virtuous and wise personage was in the boudoir of reception i glanced at the fatal door as i entered i have a great aversion after any thing has once happened and fairly subsided to make any allusion to its former existence i never therefore talked to the duchess about our ancient egaremens i spoke this morning of the marriage of one person the death of another and lastly the departure of my individual self when do you go she said eagerly in two days my departure will be softened if i can execute any commissions in england for madame none said she and then in a low tone that none of the idlers who were always found at her morning levees should hear she added you will receive a note from me this evening i bowed changed the conversation and withdrew i dined in my own rooms and spent the evening in looking over the various billetsdoux received during my sejour at paris where shall i put all these locks of hair asked bedos opening a drawer full into my scrapbook and all these letters into the fire i was just getting into bed when the duchesse de perpignans note arrivedit was as follows my dear friend for that word so doubtful in our language i may at least call you in your own i am unwilling that you should leave this country with those sentiments you now entertain of me unaltered yet i cannot imagine any form of words of sufficient magic to change them oh if you knew how much i am to be pitied if you could look for one moment into this lonely and blighted heart if you could trace step by step the progress i have made in folly and sin you would see how much of what you now condemn and despise i have owed to circumstances rather than to the vice of my disposition i was born a beauty educated a beauty owed fame rank power to beauty and it is to the advantages i have derived from person that i owe the ruin of my mind you have seen how much i now derive from art i loathe myself as i write that sentence but no matter from that moment you loathed me too you did not take into consideration </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> consideration that i had been living on excitement all my youth and that in my maturer years i could not relinquish it i had reigned by my attractions and i thought every art preferable to resigning my empire but in feeding my vanity i had not been able to stifle the dictates of my heart love is so natural to a woman that she is scarcely a woman who resists it but in me it has been a sentiment not a passion sentiment then and vanity have been my seducers i said that i owed my errors to circumstances not to nature you will say that in confessing love and vanity to be my seducers i contradict this assertionyou are mistaken i mean that though vanity and sentiment were in me yet the scenes in which i have been placed and the events which i have witnessed gave to those latent currents of action a wrong and a dangerous direction i was formed to love for one whom i did love i could have made every sacrifice i married a man i hated and i only learnt the depths of my heart when it was too late enough of this you will leave this country we shall never meet againnever you may return to paris but i shall then be no more nimportei shall be unchanged to the last je mourrai en reine as a latest pledge of what i have felt for you i send you the enclosed chain and ring as a latest favour i request you to wear them for six months and above all for two hours in the tuileries tomorrow you will laugh at this request it seems idle and romanticperhaps it is so love has many exaggerations in sentiment which reason would despise what wonder then that mine above that of all others should conceive them you will not i know deny this request farewellin this world we shall never meet again and i believe not in the existence of another farewell e p a most sensible effusion said i to myself when i had read this billet and yet after all it shows more feeling and more character than i could have supposed she possessed i took up the chain it was of maltese workmanship not very handsome nor indeed in any way remarkable except for a plain hair ring which was attached to it and which i found myself unable to take off without breaking it is a very singular request thought i but then it comes from a very singular person and as it rather partakes of adventure and intrigue i shall at all events appear in the tuileries tomorrow chained and ringed </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxviii thy incivility shall not make me fail to do what becomes me and since thou hast more valour than courtesy i for thee will hazard that life which thou wouldst take from mecassandra elegantly done into english by sir charles cotterell about the usual hour for the promenade in the tuileries i conveyed myself thither i set the chain and ring in full display rendered still more conspicuous by the dark coloured dress which i always wore i had not been in the gardens ten minutes before i perceived a young frenchman scarcely twenty years of age look with a very peculiar air at my new decorations he passed and repassed me much oftener than the alternations of the walk warranted and at last taking off his hat said in a low tone that he wished much for the honour of exchanging a few words with me in private i saw at the first glance that he was a gentleman and accordingly withdrew with him among the trees in the more retired part of the garden permit me said he to inquire how that ring and chain came into your possession monsieur i replied you will understand me when i say that the honour of another person is implicated in my concealment of that secret sir said the frenchman colouring violently i have seen them beforein a word they belong to me i smiledmy young hero fired at this oui monsieur said he speaking very loud and very quick they belong to me and i insist upon your immediately restoring them or vindicating your claim to them by arms you leave me but one answer monsieur said i i will find a friend to wait upon you immediately allow me to inquire your address the frenchman who was greatly agitated produced a card we bowed and separated i was glancing over the address i held in my hand which wasc dazimart rue de bourbon numero when my ears were saluted with now do you know methou shouldst be alonzo i did not require the faculty of sight to recognize lord vincent my dear fellow said i i am rejoiced to see you and thereupon i poured into his ear the particulars of my morning adventure lord vincent listened to me with much apparent interest and spoke very unaffectedly of his readiness to serve me and his regret at the occasion pooh said i a duel in france is not like one in england the former is a matter of course a trifle of common occurrence one makes an engagement to fight in the same breath as an engagement to dine but the latter is a thing of state and solemnitylong facesearly risingand willmaking but do get this business over as soon as you can that we may dine at the rocher afterwards well my dear pelham said vincent i cannot refuse you my services and as i suppose monsieur dazimart will choose swords i venture to augur everything from your skill in that species of weapon it is the first time i have ever interfered in affairs of this nature but i hope to get well through the present nobilis ornatur lauro collega secundo as juvenal says au revoir and away went lord vincent half forgetting all his late anxiety for my life in his paternal pleasure for the delivery of his quotation vincent is the only punster i ever knew with a good heart no action to that race in general is so serious an occupation as the play upon words and the remorseless habit of murdering a phrase renders them perfectly obdurate to the simple death of a friend i walked through every variety the straight paths of the tuileries could afford and was beginning to get exceedingly tired when lord vincent returned he looked very grave and i saw at once that he was come to particularize the circumstances of the last extreme the bois de boulognepistolsin one hour were the three leading features of his detail pistols said i well be it so i would rather have had swords for the young mans sake as much as my own but thirteen paces and a steady aim will settle the business as soon we will try a bottle of the chambertin today vincent the punster smiled faintly and for once in his life made no reply we walked gravely and soberly to my lodgings for the pistols and then proceeded to the engagement as silently as christians should do the frenchman and his second were on the ground first i saw that the former was pale and agitated not i think from fear but passion when we took our ground vincent came to me and said in a low tone for gods sake suffer me to accommodate this if possible it is not in our power said i receiving the pistol i looked steadily at dazimart and took my aim his pistol owing i suppose to the trembling of his hand went off a moment sooner than he had anticipatedthe ball grazed my hat my aim was more successfuli struck him in the shoulderthe exact place i had intended he staggered a few paces but did not fall we hastened towards himhis cheek assumed a still more livid hue as i approached he muttered some halfformed curses between his teeth and turned from me to his second you will inquire whether monsieur dazimart is satisfied said i to vincent and retired to a short distance his second said vincent after a brief conference with that person replies to my question that monsieur dazimarts wound has left him for the present no alternative upon this answer i took vincents arm and we returned forthwith to my carriage i congratulate you most sincerely on the event of this duel said vincent monsieur de mdazimarts second informed me when i waited on him that your antagonist was one of the most celebrated pistol shots in paris and that a lady with whom he had been long in love made the death of the chainbearer the price of her favours devilish lucky for you my good fellow that his hand trembled so but i did not know you were so good a shot why i answered i am not what is vulgarly termed a crack shoti cannot split a bullet on a penknife but i am sure of a target somewhat smaller than a man and my hand is as certain in the field as it is in the practiceyard le sentiment de nos forces les augmente replied vincent shall i tell the coachman to drive to the rocher </chapter>

consoler dune chose donc je me suis deja console tant de foislettres de boileau as i was walking home with vincent from the rue montorgueil i saw on entering the rue st honore two figures before us the tall and noble stature of the one i could not for a moment mistake they stopped at the door of an hotel which opened in that noiseless manner so peculiar to the conciergerie of france i was at the porte the moment they disappeared but not before i had caught a glance of the dark locks and pale countenance of warburtonmy eye fell upon the number of the hotel surely said i i have been in that house before likely enough growled vincent who was gloriously drunk it is a house </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> house of twofold utilityyou may play with cards or coquet with women selon votre gout at these words i remembered the hotel and its inmates immediately it belonged to an old nobleman who though on the brink of the grave was still grasping at the good things on the margin he lived with a pretty and clever woman who bore the name and honours of his wife they kept up two salons one pour le petit souper and the other pour le petit jeu you saw much ecarte and more lovemaking and lost your heart and your money with equal facility in a word the marquis and his jolie petite femme were a wise and prosperous couple who made the best of their lives and lived decently and honourably upon other people allons pelham cried vincent as i was still standing at the door in deliberation how much longer will you keep me to congeal in this eager and nipping airquamdiu nostram patientiam abutere catilina let us enter said i i have the run of the house and we may find some young vicessome fair iniquities interrupted vincent with a hiccup leade on good fellowe quoth robin hood lead on i do bid thee and with these words the door opened in obedience to my rap and we mounted to the marquiss tenement au premiere the room was pretty fullthe soidisante marquise was flitting from table to tablebetting at each and coquetting with all and the marquis himself with a moist eye and a shaking hand was affecting the don juan with the various elviras and annas with which his salon was crowded vincent was trying to follow me through the crowd but his confused vision and unsteady footing led him from one entanglement to another till he was quite unable to proceed a tall corpulent frenchman six foot by five was leaning a great and weighty objection just before him utterly occupied in the vicissitudes of an ecarte table and unconscious of vincents repeated efforts first on one side and then on the other to pass him at last the perplexed wit getting more irascible as he grew more bewildered suddenly seized the vast incumbrance by the arm and said to him in a sharp querulous tone pray monsieur why are you like the lote tree in mahomets seventh heaven sir cried the astonished frenchman because continued vincent answering his own enigmabecause beyond you there is no passing the frenchman one of that race who always forgive any thing for a bon mot smiled bowed and drew himself aside vincent steered by and joining me hiccuped out in rebus adversis opponite pectora fortia meanwhile i had looked round the room for the objects of my pursuit to my great surprise i could not perceive them they may be in the other room thought i and to the other room i went the supper was laid out and an old bonne was quietly helping herself to some sweetmeat all other human beings if indeed an old woman can be called a human being were however invisible and i remained perfectly bewildered as to the nonappearance of warburton and his companion i entered the salle a jouer once morei looked round in every corneri examined every facebut in vain and with a feeling of disappointment very disproportioned to my loss i took vincents arm and we withdrew the next morning i spent with madame danville a frenchwoman easily consoles herself for the loss of a lovershe

love wandering over flowers proffers honey but bears not a sting ah happy time in the lines of one who can so well translate feeling into words fate has not darkened thee hope has not made the

<chapter>chapter xxx it must be confessed that flattery comes mighty easily to ones mouth in the presence of royaltyletters of stephen montague tis hehow came he thencewhat doth he herelara i had received for that evening my last at paris an invitation from the duchesse de b i knew that the party was to be small and that very few besides the royal family would compose it i had owed the honour of this invitation to my intimacy with thes the great friends of the duchesse and i promised myself some pleasure in the engagement there were but eight or nine persons present when i entered the royal chamber the most distingue of these i recognized immediately as the he came forward with much grace as i approached and expressed his pleasure at seeing me you were presented i think about a month ago added the with a smile of singular fascination i remember it well i bowed low to this compliment do you propose staying long at paris continued the i protracted i replied my departure solely for the honour this evening affords me in so doing please your i have followed the wise maxim of keeping the greatest pleasure to the last the royal chevalier bowed to my answer with a smile still sweeter than before and began a conversation with me which lasted for several minutes i was much struck with thes air and bearing they possess great dignity without any affectation of its assumption he speaks peculiarly good english and the compliment of addressing me in that language was therefore as judicious as delicate his observations owed little to his rank they would have struck you as appropriate and the air which accompanied them pleased you as graceful even in a simple individual judge then if they charmed me in the the upper part of his countenance is prominent and handsome and his eyes have much softness of expression his figure is slight and particularly well knit perhaps he is altogether more adapted to strike in private than in public effect upon the whole he is one of those very few persons of great rank whom you would have had pride in knowing as an equal and have pleasure in acknowledging as a superior as thepaused and turned with great courtesy to the duc de i bowed my way to the duchesse de b that personage whose liveliness and piquancy of manner always make one wish for ones own sake that her rank was less exalted was speaking with great volubility to a tall stupid looking man one of the ministers and smiled most graciously upon me as i drew near she spoke to me of our national amusements you are not said she so fond of dancing as we are we have not the same exalted example to be at once our motive and our model said i in allusion to the duchesses well known attachment to that accomplishment the duchesse dacame up as i said this and the conversation flowed on evenly enough till thes whist party was formed his partner was madame de la r the heroine of la vendee she was a tall and very stout woman singularly lively and entertaining and appeared to possess both the moral and the physical energy to accomplish feats still more noble than those she performed i soon saw that it would not do for me to stay very long i had already made a favourable impression and in such cases it is my constant rule immediately to retire stay if it be whole hours until you have pleased but leave the moment after your success a great genius should not linger too long either in the salon or the world he must quit each with eclat in obedience to this rule i no sooner found that my court had been effectually made than i rose to withdraw you will return soon to paris said the duchesse de b i cannot resist it i replied mon corps reviendra pour chercher mon coeur we shall not forget you said the duchesse your highness has now given me my only inducement not to return i answered as i bowed out of the room it was much too early to go home at that time i was too young and restless to sleep till long after midnight and while i was deliberating in what manner to pass the hours i suddenly recollected the hotel in the rue st honore to which vincent and i had paid so unceremonious a visit the night before impressed with the hope that i might be more successful in meeting warburton than i had then been i ordered the coachman to drive to the abode of the old marquisthe salon was as crowded as usual i lost a few napoleons at ecarte in order to pay my entree and then commenced a desultory flirtation with one of the fair decoys in this occupation my eye and my mind frequently wandered i could not divest myself of the hope of once more seeing warburton before my departure from paris and every reflection which confirmed my suspicions of his identity redoubled my interest in his connection with tyrrell and the vulgar debauche of the rue st dominique i was making some languid reply to my cynthia of </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> of the minute when my ear was suddenly greeted by an english voice i looked round and saw thornton in close conversation with a man whose back was turned to me but whom i rightly conjectured to be tyrrell oh hell be here soon said the former and well bleed him regularly tonight it is very singular that you who play so much better should not have floored him yesterday evening tyrrell replied in a tone so low as to be inaudible and a minute afterwards the door opened and warburton entered he came up instantly to thornton and his companion and after a few words of ordinary salutation warburton said in one of those modulated tones so peculiar to himself i am sure tyrrell that you must be eager for your revenge to lose to such a mere tyro as myself is quite enough to double the pain of defeat and the desire of retaliation i did not hear tyrrells reply but the trio presently moved towards the door which till then i had not noticed and which was probably the entrance to our hostesss boudoir the soidisant marquise opened it herself for which kind office thornton gave her a leer and a wink characteristic of his claims to gallantry when the door was again closed upon them i went up to the marquise and after a few compliments asked whether the room messieurs les anglois had entered was equally open to all guests why said she with a slight hesitation those gentlemen play for higher stakes than we usually do here and one of them is apt to get irritated by the advice and expostulations of the lookers on and so after they had played a short time in the salon last night monsieur thornton a very old friend of mine here the lady looked down asked me permission to occupy the inner room and as i knew him so well i could have no scruple in obliging him then i suppose said i that as a stranger i have not permission to intrude upon them shall i inquire answered the marquise no said i it is not worth while and accordingly i reseated myself and appeared once more occupied in saying des belles choses to my kindhearted neighbour i could not however with all my dissimulation sustain a conversation from which my present feelings were so estranged for more than a few minutes and i was never more glad than when my companion displeased with my inattention rose and left me to my own reflections what could warburton if he were the person i suspected gain by the disguise he had assumed he was too rich to profit by any sums he could win from tyrrell and too much removed from thorntons station in life to derive any pleasure or benefit from his acquaintance with that person his dark threats of vengeance in the jardin des plantes and his reference to the two hundred pounds tyrrell possessed gave me indeed some clue as to his real object but thenwhy this disguise had he known tyrrell before in his proper semblance and had anything passed between them which rendered this concealment now expedientthis indeed seemed probable enough but was thornton entrusted with the secretand if revenge was the object was that low man a partaker in its executionor was he not more probably playing the traitor to both as for tyrrell himself his own designs upon warburton were sufficient to prevent pity for any fall into the pit he had dug for others meanwhile time passed on the hour grew late and the greater part of the guests were gone still i could not tear myself away i looked from time to time at the door with an indescribable feeling of anxiety i longed yet dreaded for it to open i felt as if my own fate were in some degree implicated in what was then agitating within and i could not resolve to depart until i had formed some conclusions on the result at length the door opened tyrrell came forthhis countenance was perfectly hueless his cheek was sunk and hollow the excitement of two hours had been sufficient to render it so i observed that his teeth were set and his hand clenched as they are when we idly seek by the strained and extreme tension of the nerves to sustain the fever and the agony of the mind warburton and thornton followed him the latter with his usual air of reckless indifferencehis quick rolling eye glanced from the marquis to myself and though his colour changed slightly his nod of recognition was made with its wonted impudence and ease but warburton passed on like tyrrell without noticing or heeding any thing around he fixed his large bright eye upon the figure which preceded him without once altering its direction and the extreme beauty of his features which not all the dishevelled length of his hair and whiskers could disguise was lighted up with a joyous but savage expression which made me turn away almost with a sensation of fear just as tyrrell was leaving the room warburton put his hand upon his shoulderstay said he i am going your way and will accompany you he turned round to thornton who was already talking with the marquis as he said this and waved his hand as if to prevent his following the next moment tyrrell and himself had left the room i could not now remain longer i felt a feverish restlessness which impelled me onwards i quitted the salon and was on the escalier before the gamesters had descended warburton was indeed but a few steps before me the stairs were but very dimly lighted by one expiring lamp he did not turn round to see me and was probably too much engrossed to hear me you may yet have a favourable reverse said he to tyrrell impossible replied the latter in a tone of such deep anguish that it thrilled me to the very heart i am an utter beggari have nothing in the worldi have no expectation but to starve while he was saying this i perceived by the faint and uncertain light that warburtons hand was raised to his own countenance have you no hopeno spot wherein to look for comfortis beggary your absolute and only possible resource from famine he replied in a low and suppressed tone at that moment we were just descending into the courtyard warburton was but one step behind tyrrell the latter made no answer but as he passed from the dark staircase into the clear moonlight of the court i caught a glimpse of the big tears which rolled heavily and silently down his cheeks warburton laid his hand upon him turn he cried suddenly your cup is not yet fulllook upon meand remember i pressed forwardthe light shone full upon the countenance of the speakerthe dark hair was gonemy suspicions were truei discovered at one glance the bright locks and lofty brow of reginald glanville slowly tyrrell gazed as if he were endeavouring to repel some terrible remembrance which gathered with every instant more fearfully upon him until as the stern countenance of glanville grew darker and darker in its mingled scorn and defiance he uttered one low cry and sank senseless upon the earth </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxi well he is gone and with him go these thoughtsshakspeare what ho for englandshakspeare i have always had an insuperable horror of being placed in what the vulgar call a predicament in a predicament i was most certainly placed at the present moment a man at my feet in a fitthe cause of it having very wisely disappeared devolving upon me the charge of watching recovering and conducting home the afflicted personmade a concatenation of disagreeable circumstances as much unsuited to the temper of henry pelham as his evil fortune could possibly have contrived after a short pause of deliberation i knocked up the porter procured some cold water and bathed tyrrells temples for several moments before he recovered he opened his eyes slowly and looked carefully round with a fearful and suspicious glance gonegonehe mutteredaywhat did he here at such a momentvengeancefor whati could not tellit would have killed herlet him thank his own folly i do not fear i defy his malice and with these words tyrrell sprung to his feet can i assist you to your home said i you are still unwellpray suffer me to have that pleasure i spoke with some degree of warmth and sincerity the unfortunate man stared wildly at me for a moment before he replied who said he at last who speaks to methe lostthe guiltythe ruined in the accents of interest and kindness i placed his arm in mine and drew him out of the yard into the open street he looked at me with an eager and wistful survey and then by degrees appearing to recover his full consciousness of the present and recollection of the past he pressed my hand warmly and after a short silence during which we moved on slowly towards the tuileries he saidpardon me sir if i have not sufficiently thanked you for your kindness and attention i am now quite restored the close room in which i have been sitting for so many hours and the feverish excitement of play acting upon a frame very debilitated by ill health occasioned my momentary indisposition i am now i repeat quite recovered and will no longer trespass upon your good nature really said i you had better not discard my services yet do suffer me to accompany you home home muttered tyrrell with a deep sigh nono and then as if recollecting himself he said i thank you sir butbut i saw his embarrassment and interrupted him well if i cannot assist you any further i will take your dismissal i trust we shall meet again under auspices better calculated for improving acquaintance tyrrell bowed once more pressed my hand and we parted i hurried on up the long street towards my hotel when i had got several paces beyond tyrrell i turned back to look at him he was standing in the same place in which i had left him i saw by the moonlight that this </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> this face and hands were raised towards heaven it was but for a moment his attitude changed while i was yet looking and he slowly and calmly continued his way in the same direction as myself when i reached my chambers i hastened immediately to bed but not to sleep the extraordinary scene i had witnessed the dark and ferocious expression of glanvilles countenance so strongly impressed with every withering and deadly passion the fearful and unaccountable remembrance that had seemed to gather over the livid and varying face of the gamester the mystery of glanvilles disguise the intensity of a revenge so terribly expressed together with the restless and burning anxiety i feltnot from idle curiosity but from my early and intimate friendship for glanville to fathom its causeall crowded upon my mind with a feverish confusion that effectually banished repose it was with that singular sensation of pleasure which none but those who have passed frequent nights in restless and painful agitation can recognize that i saw the bright sun penetrate through my shutters and heard bedos move across my room what hour will monsieur have the post horses said that praiseworthy valet at eleven answered i springing out of bed with joy at the change of scene which the very mention of my journey brought before my mind i was a luxurious personage in those days i had had a bath made from my own design across it were constructed two small framesone for the journal of the day and another to hold my breakfast apparatus in this manner i was accustomed to lie for about an hour engaging the triple happiness of reading feeding and bathing owing to some unaccountable delay galignanis messenger did not arrive at the usual hour on the morning of my departure to finish breakfast or bathing without galignanis messenger was perfectly impossible so i remained till i was half boiled in a state of the most indolent imbecility at last it came the first paragraph that struck my eyes was the followingit is rumoured among the circles of the faubourg that a duel was fought on between a young englishman and monsieur d the cause of it is said to be the pretensions of both to the beautiful duchesse de p who if report be true cares for neither of the gallants but lavishes her favours upon a certain attache to the english embassy such thought i are the materials for all human histories every one who reads will eagerly swallow this account as true if an author were writing the memoirs of the court he would compile his facts and scandal from this very collection of records and yet though so near the truth how totally false it is thank heaven however that at least i am not suspected of the degradation of the duchesses loveto fight for her may make me seem a foolto be loved by her would constitute me a villain the next passage in that collection of scandal which struck me waswe understand that e w howard de howard esq secretary is shortly to lead to the hymeneal altar the daughter of timothy tomkins esq late consul of i quite started out of my bath with delight i scarcely suffered myself to be dried and perfumed before i sat down to write the following congratulatory epistle to the thin man my dear mr howard de howard permit me before i leave paris to compliment you upon that happiness which i have just learnt is in store for you marriage to a man like you who has survived the vanities of the worldwho has attained that prudent age when the passions are calmed into reason and the purer refinements of friendship succeed to the turbulent delirium of the sensesmarriage my dear mr howard to a man like you must indeed be a most delicious utopia after all the mortifications you may meet elsewhere whether from malicious females or a misjudging world what happiness to turn to one being to whom your praise is an honour and your indignation of consequence but if marriage itself be so desirable what words shall i use sufficiently expressive of my congratulation at the particular match you have chosen so suitable in birth and station i can fancy you my dear sir in your dignified retirement expatiating to your admiring bride upon all the honours of your illustrious line and receiving from her in return a full detail of all the civic glories that have ever graced the lineage of the tomkinss as the young lady is i suppose an heiress i conclude you will take her name instead of changing it mr howard de howard de tomkins will sound peculiarly majestic and when you come to the titles and possessions of your ancestors i am persuaded that you will continue to consider your alliance with the honest citizens of london among your proudest distinctions should you have any commands in england a letter directed to me in grosvenorsquare will be sure to find me and you may rely upon my immediately spreading among our mutual acquaintance in london the happy measure you are about to adopt and my opinions on its propriety adieu my dear sir with the greatest respect and truth yours h pelham there said i as i sealed my letter i have discharged some part of that debt i owe to mr howard de howard for an enmity towards me which he has never affected to conceal he prides himself on his youthmy allusions to his age will delight him on the importance of his good or evil opinioni have flattered him to a wonder of a surety henry pelham i could not have supposed you were such an adept in the art of panegyric the horses sir said bedos and the bill sir said the garcon alas that those and that should be so

motion of four posthorses in france where ones steeds are none of the swiftest the pleasures of travelling are not quite so great as in england still however to a man who is tired of one scenepanting for anotherin love with excitement and not yet wearied of its pursuitthe turnpike road is more grateful than the easiest chair ever invented and the little prison we entitle a carriage more cheerful

have such a swift succession of guests that we seldom see the same faces two days running we have as many changes as an english administration you are facetious said i no returned the garcon who was a philosopher as well as a wit no my digestive organs are very weak and par consequence i am naturally melancholyah ma fois tres triste and with these words the sentimental platechanger placed his handi

serviette with an air of exceeding importance off went my melancholy acquaintance to compliment new customers and complain of his digestion after i had arranged myself and my whiskerstwo very distinct affairsyawned three times and drank two bottles of soda water i strolled into the town as i was sauntering along leisurely enough i heard my name pronounced behind me i turned and saw sir willoughby townshend an old baronet of an antediluvian agea fossil witness of the wonders of england before the deluge of french manners swept away ancient customs and created out of the wrecks of what had been a new order of things and a new race of mankind ah my dear mr pelham how are you and the worthy lady frances your mother and your excellent father all wellim delighted to hear it russelton continued sir willoughby turning to a middleaged man whose arm he held you remember pelhamtrue whiggreat friend of sheridanslet me introduce his son to you mr russelton mr pelham mr pelham mr russelton at the name of the person thus introduced to me a thousand recollections crowded upon my mind the contemporary and rival of napoleonthe autocrat of the great world of fashion and cravatsthe mighty genius before whom aristocracy had been humbled and ton abashedat whose nod the haughtiest noblesse of europe had quailedwho had introduced by a single example starch into neckcloths and had fed the pampered appetite of his boottops on champagnewhose coat and whose friend were cut with an equal graceand whose name was connected with every triumph that the worlds great virtue of audacity could achievethe illustrious the immortal russelton stood before me i recognised in him a congenial though a superior spirit and i bowed with a profundity of veneration with which no other human being has ever inspired me mr russelton seemed pleased with my evident respect and returned my salutation with a mock dignity which enchanted me he offered me his disengaged arm i took it with transport and we all three proceeded up the street so said sir willoughbyso russelton you like your quarters here plenty of sport among the english i should think you have not forgot the art of quizzing eh old fellow even if i had said mr russelton speaking very slowly the sight of sir willoughby townshend would be quite sufficient to refresh my memory yes continued the venerable wreck after a short </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> short pauseyes i like my residence pretty well i enjoy a calm conscience and a clean shirt what more can man desire i have made acquaintance with a tame parrot and i have taught it to say whenever an english fool with a stiff neck and a loose swagger passes himtrue britontrue briton i take care of my health and reflect upon old age i have read gil blas and the whole duty of man and in short what with instructing my parrot and improving myself i think i pass my time as creditably and decorously as the bishop of winchester or my lord of avly himself so you have just come from paris i presume mr pelham i left it yesterday full of those horrid english i suppose thrusting their broad hats and narrow minds into every shop in the palais royalwinking their dull eyes at the damsels of the counter and manufacturing their notions of french into a higgle for sous oh the monstersthey bring on a bilious attack whenever i think of them the other day one of them accosted me and talked me into a nervous fever about patriotism and roast pigs luckily i was near my own house and reached it before the thing became fatal but only think had i wandered too far when he met me at my time of life the shock would have been too great i should certainly have perished in a fit i hope at least they would have put the cause of my death in my epitaphdied of an englishman john russelton esq aged pah you are not engaged mr pelham dine with me today willoughby and his umbrella are coming volontiers said i though i was going to make observations on men and manners at the table dhote of my hotel i am most truly grieved replied mr russelton at depriving you of so much amusement with me you will only find some tolerable lafitte and an anomalous dish my cuisiniere calls a mutton chop it will be curious to see what variation in the monotony of mutton she will adopt today the first time i ordered a chop i thought i had amply explained every necessary particular a certain portion of flesh and a gridiron at seven oclock up came a cotelette panee faute de mieux i swallowed the composition drowned as it was in a most pernicious sauce i had one hours sleep and the nightmare in consequence the next day i imagined no mistake could be made sauce was strictly prohibited all extra ingredients laid under a most special veto and a natural gravy gently recommended the cover was removed and lo a breast of mutton all bone and gristle like the dying gladiator this time my heart was too full for wrath i sat down and wept today will be the third time i shall make the experiment if french cooks will consent to let one starve upon nature for my part i have no stomach left now for art i wore out my digestion in youth swallowing jack st legers suppers and sheridans promises to pay pray mr pelham did you try staub when you were at paris yes and thought him one degree better than stultz whom indeed i have long condemned as fit only for minors at oxford and majors in the infantry true said russelton with a very faint smile at a pun somewhat in his own way and levelled at a tradesman of whom he was perhaps a little jealoustrue stultz aims at making gentlemen not coats there is a degree of aristocratic pretension in his stitches which is vulgar to an appalling degree you can tell a stultz coat any where which is quite enough to damn it the moment a mans known by an invariable cut and that not original it ought to be all over with him give me the man who makes the tailor not the tailor who makes the man right by g cried sir willoughby who was as badly dressed as one of sir es dinners right just my opinion i have always told my schneiders to make my clothes neither in the fashion nor out of it to copy no other mans coat and to cut their cloth according to my natural body not according to an isosceles triangle look at this coat for instance and sir willoughby townshend made a dead halt that we might admire his garment the more accurately coat said russelton with an appearance of the most naive surprise and taking hold of the collar suspiciously by the finger and thumb coat sir willoughby do you call this thing a coat </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxiii jai toujours cru que le bon netait que le beau mis en action rousseau shortly after russeltons answer to sir willoughbys eulogistic observations on his own attire i left those two worthies till i was to join them at dinner it wanted three hours yet to that time and i repaired to my quarters to bathe and write letters i scribbled one to madame danville full of antitheses and maxims sure to charm her another to my mother to prepare her for my arrival and a third to lord vincent giving him certain commissions at paris which i had forgotten personally to execute my pen is not that of a ready writer and what with yawning stretching admiring my rings and putting pen to paper in the intervals of these more natural occupations it was time to bathe and dress before my letters were completed i set off to russeltons abode in high spirits and fully resolved to make the most of a character so original it was a very small room in which i found him he was stretched in an easy chair before the fireplace gazing complacently at his feet and apparently occupied in any thing but listening to sir willoughby townsend who was talking with great vehemence about politics and the corn laws notwithstanding the heat of the weather there was a small fire on the hearth which aided by the earnestness of his efforts to convince his host put poor sir willoughby into a most intense perspiration russelton however seemed enviably cool and hung over the burning wood like a cucumber on a hotbed sir willoughby came to a full stop by the window and gasping for breath attempted to throw it open what are you doing for heavens sake what are you doing cried russelton starting up do you mean to kill me kill you said sir willoughby quite aghast yes kill me is it not quite cold enough already in this dd seafaring place without making my only retreat humble as it is a theatre for thorough draughts have i not had the rheumatism in my left shoulder and the ague in my little finger these last six months and must you now terminate my miserable existence at one blow by opening that abominable lattice do you think because your great frame fresh from the yorkshire wolds and compacted of such materials that one would think in eating your beeves you had digested their hides into skindo you think because your limbs might be cut up into planks for a seventyeight and warranted waterproof without pitch because of the density of their poresdo you think because you are as impervious as an araphorostic shoe that i john russelton am equally impenetrable and that you are to let easterly winds play about my room like children begetting rheums and asthmas and all manner of catarrhs i do beg sir willoughby townshend that you will suffer me to die a more natural and civilized death and so saying russelton sank down into his chair apparently in the last state of exhaustion sir willoughby who remembered the humourist in all his departed glory and still venerated him as a temple where the deity yet breathed though the altar was overthrown made to this extraordinary remonstrance no other reply than a long whiff and a well russelton dash my wig a favourite oath of sir ws but youre a queer fellow russelton now turned to me and invited me with a tone of the most ladylike languor to sit down near the fire as i am naturally of a chilly disposition and fond too of beating people in their own line i drew a chair close to the hearth declared the weather was very cold and rung the bell for some more wood russelton started for a moment and then with a politeness he had not deigned to exert before approached his chair to mine and began a conversation which in spite of his bad witticisms and peculiarity of manner i found singularly entertaining dinner was announced and we adjourned to another roompoor sir willoughby with his waistcoat unbuttoned and breathing like a pug in a phthisisgroaned bitterly when he discovered that this apartment was smaller and hotter than the one before russelton immediately helped him to some scalding soupand said as he told the servant to hand sir willoughby the cayenneyou will find this my dear townshend a very sensible potage for this severe season dinner went off tamely enough with the exception of our stout friends agony which russelton enjoyed most luxuriously the threatened muttonchops did not make their appearance and the dinner though rather too small was excellently cooked and better arranged with the dessert the poor baronet rose and pleading sudden indisposition tottered out of the door when he was gone russelton threw himself back in his chair and laughed for several minutes with a loud chuckling sound till the tears ran down his cheek a nice heart you must have thought imy conclusions of character are always drawn from small propensities after a few jests at sir willoughby our conversation turned upon other individuals i soon saw that russelton was a soured and disappointed man his remarks on people were all sarcasmshis mind was overflowed with a suffusion of illnaturehe bit as well as growled no man of the world ever i am convinced becomes a real philosopher in retirement people who have been employed for years upon trifles have not the greatness of mind which could alone make them indifferent to what they have coveted all their lives as most enviable </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> enviable and important have you read s memoirs said mr russelton no well i imagined every one had at least dipped into them i have often had serious thoughts of dignifying my own retirement by the literary employment of detailing my adventures in the world i think i could throw a new light upon things and persons which my contemporaries will shrink back like owls at perceiving your life said i must indeed furnish matter of equal instruction and amusement ay answered russelton amusement to the fools but instruction to the knaves i am indeed a lamentable example of the fall of ambition i brought starch into all the neckcloths in england and i end by tying my own at a threeinch lookingglass at calais you are a young man mr pelham about to commence life probably with the same views as though greater advantages than myself perhaps in indulging my egotism i shall not weary without recompensing you i came into the world with an inordinate love of glory and a great admiration of the original these propensities might have made me a shakspearethey did more they made me a russelton when i was six years old i cut my jacket into a coat and turned my aunts best petticoat into a waistcoat i disdained at eight the language of the vulgar and when my father asked me to fetch his slippers i replied that my soul swelled beyond the limits of a lackeys at nine i was selfinoculated with propriety of ideas i rejected malt with the air of his majesty and formed a violent affection for maraschino though starving at school i never took twice of pudding and paid sixpence a week out of my shilling to have my shoes blacked as i grew up my notions expanded i gave myself without restraint to the ambition that burnt within mei cut my old friends who were rather envious than emulous of my genius and i employed three tradesmen to make my glovesone for the hand a second for the fingers and a third for the thumb these two qualities made me courted and admired by a new racefor the great secrets of being courted are to shun others and seem delighted with yourself the latter is obvious enough who the deuce should be pleased with you if you yourself are not before i left college i fell in love other fellows at my age in such a predicament would have whinedshaved only twice a week and written verses i did none of the threethe last indeed i tried but to my infinite surprise i found my genius was not universal i began with sweet nymph for whom i wake my muse for this after considerable hammering i could only think of the rhyme shoesso i began again thy praise demands much softer lutes and the fellow of this verse terminated like myself in bootsother efforts were equally successfulbloom suggested to my imagination no rhyme but perfumedespair only reminded me of my hairand hope was met at the end of the second verse by the inharmonious antithesis of soap finding therefore that my forte was not in the pierian line i redoubled my attention to my dress i coated and cravated and essenced and oiled with all the attention the very inspiration of my rhymes seemed to advisein short i thought the best pledge i could give my dulcinea of my passion for her person would be to show her what affectionate veneration i could pay to my own my mistress could not withhold from me her admiration but she denied me her love she confessed mr russelton was the best dressed man at the university and had the whitest hands and two days after this avowal she ran away with a great rosycheeked extract from leicestershire i did not blame her i pitied her too muchbut i made a vow never to be in love again in spite of all advantages i kept my oath and avenged myself on the species for the insult of the individual before i commenced a part which was to continue through life i considered deeply on the humours of the spectators i saw that the character of the english was servile to rank and yielding to pretensionthey admire you for your acquaintance and cringe to you for your conceit the first thing therefore was to know great peoplethe second to controul them i dressed well and had good horsesthat was sufficient to make me sought by the young of my own sex i talked scandal and was never abashedthat was more than enough to make me recherche among the matrons of the other it is single men and married women to whom are given the st peters keys of society i was soon admitted into its heaveni was morei was one of its saints i became imitated as well as initiated i was the ragethe lion whywas i betterwas i richerwas i handsomerwas i cleverer than my kind no noand here russelton ground his teeth with a strong and wrathful expression of scornand had i been allhad i been a very concentration and monopoly of all human perfections they would not have valued me at half the price they did set on me it wasi will tell you the simple secret mr pelhamit was because i trampled on them that like crushed herbs they sent up a grateful incense in return oh it was balm to my bitter and loathing temper to see those who would have spurned me from them if they dared writhe beneath my lash as i withheld or inflicted it at will i was the magician who held the great spirits that longed to tear me to pieces by one simple spell which a superior hardihood had won meand by heaven i did not spare to exert it well well this is but an idle recollection now all human power says the proverb of every language is but of short duration alexander did not conquer kingdoms for ever and russeltons good fortune deserted him at last napoleon died in exile and so shall i but we have both had our day and mine was the brightest of the two for it had no change till the evening i am more happy than people would think forje ne suis pas souvent ou mon corps esti live in a world of recollections i trample again upon coronets and ermine the glories of the small great i give once more laws which no libertine is so hardy not to feel exalted in adopting i hold my court and issue my fiats i am like the madman and out of the very straws of my cell i make my subjects and my realm and when i wake from these bright visions and see myself an old deserted man forgotten and decaying inch by inch in a foreign village i can at least summon sufficient of my ancient regality of spirit not to sink beneath the reverse if i am inclined to be melancholy why i extinguish my fire and imagine i have demolished a duchess i steal up to my solitary chamber to renew again in my sleep the phantoms of my youth to carouse with princes to legislate for nobles and to wake in the morning here russeltons countenance and manner suddenly changed to an affectation of methodistical gravity and thank heaven that i have still a coat to my stomach as well as to my back and that i am safely delivered of such villainous company to forswear sack and live cleanly during the rest of my sublunary existence after this long detail of mr russeltons the conversation was but dull and broken i could not avoid indulging a reverie upon what i had heard and my host was evidently still revolving the recollections his narration had conjured up we sat opposite each other for several minutes as abstracted and distracted as if we had been a couple two months married till at last i rose and tendered my adieus russelton received them with his usual coldness but more than his usual civility for he followed me to the door just as they were about to shut it he called me back mr pelham said he mr pelham when you come back this way do look in upon me andand as you will be going a good deal into society just find out what people say of my manner of life it will be perceived by those readers who are kind or patient enough to reach the conclusion of this work that russelton is specified as one of my few dramatis personae of which only the first outline is taken from real life all the restall indeed which forms and marks the character thus briefly delineated is drawn solely from imagination </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxiv an old worshipful gentleman that had a great estate and kept a brave old house at a hospitable rateold song i think i may without much loss to the reader pass in silence over my voyage the next day to dover horrible reminiscence i may also spare him an exact detail of all the inns and impositions between that seaport and london nor will it be absolutely necessary to the plot of this history to linger over every milestone between the metropolis and glenmorris castle where my uncle and my mother were impatiently awaiting the arrival of the candidate to be it was a fine bright evening when my carriage entered the park i had not seen the place for years and i felt my heart swell with something like family pride as i gazed on the magnificent extent of hill and plain that opened upon me as i passed the ancient and ivycovered lodge large groups of trees scattered on either side seemed in their own antiquity the witness of that of the family which had given them existence the sun set on the waters which lay gathered in a lake at the foot of the hill breaking the waves into unnumbered sapphires and tinging the dark firs that overspread the margin with a rich and golden light that put me excessively in mind of the duke ofs livery when i descended at the gate the servants who stood arranged </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> arranged in an order so long that it almost startled me received me with a visible gladness and animation which shewed me at one glance the old fashioned tastes of their master who in these days ever inspires his servants with a single sentiment of regard or interest for himself or his whole race that tribe one never indeed considers as possessing a life separate from their services to us beyond that purpose of existence we know not even if they exist as providence made the stars for the benefit of earth so it made servants for the use of gentlemen and as neither stars nor servants appear except when we want them so i suppose they are in a sort of suspense from being except at those important and happy moments to returnfor if i have any fault it is too great a love for abstruse speculation and reflectioni was formally ushered through a great hall hung round with huge antlers and rusty armour through a lesser one supported by large stone columns and without any other adornment than the arms of the family then through an antiroom covered with tapestry representing the gallantries of king solomon to the queen of sheba and lastly into the apartment honoured by the august presence of lord glenmorris that personage was dividing the sofa with three spaniels and a setter he rose hastily when i was announced and then checking the first impulse which hurried him perhaps into an unseemly warmth of salutation held out his hand with a pompous air of kindly protection and while he pressed mine surveyed me from head to foot to see how far my appearance justified his condescension having at last satisfied himself he proceeded to inquire after the state of my appetite he smiled benignantly when i confessed that i was excessively well prepared to testify its capacities the first idea of all kindhearted oldfashioned people is to stuff you and silently motioning to the greyheaded servant who stood in attendance till receiving the expected sign he withdrew lord glenmorris informed me that dinner was over for every one but myself that for me it would be prepared in an instant that mr toolington had expired four days since that my mother was at that moment canvassing for me and that my own electioneering qualities were to open their exhibition with the following day after this communication there was a short pause what a beautiful place this is said i with great enthusiasm lord glenmorris was pleased with the compliment simple as it was yes said he it is and i have made it still more so than you have yet been able to perceive you have been planting probably on the other side of the park no said my uncle smiling nature had done every thing for this spot when i came to it but one and the addition of that one ornament is the only real triumph which art ever can achieve what is it asked i oh i knowwater you are mistaken answered lord glenmorris it is the ornament ofhappy faces i looked up to my uncles countenance in sudden surprise i cannot explain how i was struck with the expression which it wore so calmly bright and openit was as if the very daylight had settled there you dont understand this at present henry said he after a moments silence but you will find it of all rules for the improvement of property the easiest to learn enough of this now were you not au desespoir at leaving paris i should have been some months ago but when i received my mothers summons i found the temptations of the continent very light in comparison with those held out to me here what have you already arrived at that great epoch when vanity casts off its first skin and ambition succeeds to pleasure whybut thank heaven that you have lost my moralyour dinner is announced most devoutly did i thank heaven and most earnestly did i betake myself to do honour to my uncles hospitality i had just finished my repast when my mother entered she was as you might well expect from her maternal affection quite overpowered with joy first at finding my hair grown so much darker and secondly at my looking so well we spent the whole evening in discussing the great business for which i had been summoned lord glenmorris promised me money and my mother advice and i in my turn enchanted them by promising to make the best use of both </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxv cor your good voice sirwhat say you 2nd cit you shall have it worthy sircoriolanus the borough of buyemall had long been in undisputed possession of the lords of glenmorris till a rich banker of the name of lufton had bought a large estate in the immediate neighbourhood of glenmorris castle this event which was the precursor of a mighty revolution in the borough of buyemall took place in the first year of my uncles accession to his property a few months afterwards a vacancy in the borough occurring my uncle procured the nomination of one of his own political party to the great astonishment of lord glenmorris and the great gratification of the burghers of buyemall mr lufton offered himself in opposition to the glenmorris candidate in this age of enlightenment innovation has no respect for the most sacred institutions of antiquity the burghers for the only time since their creation as a body were cast first into doubt and secondly into rebellion the lufton faction horresco referens were triumphant and the rival candidate was returned from that hour the borough of buyemall was open to all the world my uncle who was a good easy man and had some strange notions of free representation and liberty of election professed to care very little for this event he contented himself henceforward with exerting his interest for one of the members and left the other seat entirely at the disposal of the line of lufton which from the time of the first competition continued peaceably to monopolize it during the last two years my uncles candidate the late mr toolington had been gradually dying of a dropsy and the luftons had been so particularly attentive to the honest burghers that it was shrewdly suspected a bold push was to be made for the other seat during the last month these doubts were changed into certainty mr augustus leopold lufton eldest son to benjamin lufton esq had publicly declared his intention of starting at the decease of mr toolington against this personage behold myself armed and arrayed such is in brief the history of the borough up to the time in which i was to take a prominent share in its interests and events on the second day after my arrival at the castle the following advertisement appeared at buyemall to the independent electors of the borough of buyemall gentlemen in presenting myself to your notice i advance a claim not altogether new and unfounded my family have for centuries been residing amongst you and exercising that interest which reciprocal confidence and good offices may fairly create should it be my good fortune to be chosen your representative you may rely upon my utmost endeavours to deserve that honour one word upon the principles i espouse they are those which have found their advocates among the wisest and the best they are those which hostile alike to the encroachments of the crown and the licentiousness of the people would support the real interest of both upon these grounds gentlemen i have the honour to solicit your votes and it is with the sincerest respect for your ancient and honourable body that i subscribe myself your very obedient servant henry pelham glenmorris castle such was the first public signification of my intentions it was drawn up by mr sharpon our lawyer and considered by our friends as a masterpiece for as my mother sagely observed it did not commit me in a single instanceespoused no principle and yet professed what all parties would allow was the best at the first house where i called the proprietor was a clergyman of good family who had married a lady from bakerstreet of course the reverend combermere st quintin and his wife valued themselves upon being genteel i arrived at an unlucky moment on entering the hall a dirty footboy was carrying a yellowware dish of potatoes into the back room another ganymede a sort of footboy major who opened the door and who was still settling himself into his coat which he had slipped on at my tintinnabulary summons ushered me with a mouth full of bread and cheese into this said back room i gave up every thing as lost when i entered and saw the lady helping her youngest child to some ineffable trash which i have since heard is called blackberry pudding another of the tribe was bawling out with a loud hungry tonea tatoe pa the father himself was carving for the little group with a napkin stuffed into the top buttonhole of his waistcoat and the mother with a long bib plentifully bespattered with congealing gravy and the nectarean liquor of the blackberry pudding was sitting with a sort of presiding complacency on a high stool like jupiter on olympus enjoying rather than stilling the confused hubbub of the little domestic deities who eat clattered spattered and squabbled around her amidst all this din and confusion the candidate for the borough of buyemall was ushered into the household privacy of the genteel mr and mrs st quintin up started the lady at the sound of my name the reverend combermere st quintin seemed frozen into stone the plate between the youngest child and the blackberrypudding stood as still as the sun in ajalon the morsel between the mouth of the elder boy and his fork had a respite from mastication the seven sleepers could not have been spellbound more suddenly and completely ah cried i advancing eagerly with an air of serious and yet abrupt gladness how deuced lucky that i should find you all at luncheon i was up and had finished breakfast so early this morning that i am half famished only think how fortunate </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> fortunate hardy turning round to one of the members of my committee who accompanied me i was just saying what would i not give to find mr st quintin at luncheon will you allow me madam to make one of your party mrs st quintin coloured and faltered and muttered out something which i was fully resolved not to hear i took a chair looked round the table not too attentively and saidcold veal ah ah nothing i like so much may i trouble you mr st quintinhollo my little man lets see if you cant give me a potatoe theres a brave fellow how old are you my young heroto look at your mother i should say two to look at you six he is four next may said his mother colouring and this time not painfully indeed said i surveying him earnestly and then in a graver tone i turned to the reverend combermere withi think you have a branch of your family still settled in france i met monsieur st quintin the due de poictiers abroad yes said mr combermere yes the name is still in normandy but i was not aware of the title no said i with surprise and yet with another look at the boy it is astonishing how long family likenesses last i was a great favourite with all the ducs children do you know i must trouble you for some more veal it is so very good and i am so very hungry how long have you been abroad said mrs st quintin who had slipped off her bib and smoothed her ringlets for which purposes i had been most adroitly looking in an opposite direction the last three minutes about seven or eight months the fact is that the continent only does for us english people to seenot to inhabit and yet there are some advantages there mr st quintinamong others that of the due respect ancient birth is held in here you know money makes the man as the vulgar proverb has it yes said mr st quintin with a sigh it is really dreadful to see those upstarts rising around us and throwing every thing that is respectable and ancient into the back ground dangerous times these mr pelhamdangerous times nothing but innovation upon the most sacred institutions i am sure mr pelham that your principles must be decidedly against these newfashioned doctrines which lead to nothing but anarchy and confusionabsolutely nothing im delighted to find you so much of my opinion said i i cannot endure any thing that leads to anarchy and confusion here mr combermere glanced at his wifewho rose called to the children and accompanied by them gracefully withdrew now then said mr combermere drawing his chair nearer to menow mr pelham we can discuss these matters women are no politiciansand at this sage aphorism the rev combermere laughed a low solemn laugh which could have come from no other lips after i had joined in this grave merriment for a second or twoi hemmed thrice and with a countenance suited to the subject and the hosts plunged at once in medias res mr st quintin said i you are already aware i think of my intention of offering myself as a candidate for the borough of buyemall i could not think of such a measure without calling upon you the very first person to solicit the honour of your vote mr combermere looked pleased and prepared to reply you are the very first person i called upon repeated i mr combermere smiled well mr pelham said he our families have long been on the most intimate footing ever since cried i ever since henry the sevenths time have the houses of st quintin and glenmorris been allied your ancestors you know were settled in the county before ours and my mother assures me that she has read in some old book or another a long account of your forefathers kind reception of mine at the castle of st quintin i do trust sir that we have done nothing to forfeit a support so long afforded us mr st quintin bowed in speechless gratification at length he found voice but your principles mr pelham quite yours my dear sir quite against anarchy and confusion but the catholic question mr pelham oh the catholic question repeated i is a question of great importance it wont be carriedno mr st quintin no it wont be carried how did you think my dear sir that i could in so great a question act against my conscience i said this with warmth and mr st quintin was either too convinced or too timid to pursue so dangerous a topic any further i blessed my stars when he paused and not giving him time to think of another piece of debateable ground continued yes mr st quintin i called upon you the very first person your rank in the county your ancient birth to be sure demanded it but i only considered the long long time the st quintins and pelhams had been connected well said the rev combermere well mr pelham you shall have my support and i wish from my very heart all success to a young gentleman of such excellent principles </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxvi more voices sic how now my masters have you chosen him cit he has our voices sircoriolanus from mr combermere st quintins we went to a bluff hearty radical winemerchant whom i had very little probability of gaining but my success with the clerical armado had inspirited me and i did not suffer myself to fear though i could scarcely persuade myself to hope how exceedingly impossible it is in governing men to lay down positive rules even where we know the temper of the individual to be gained you must be very stiff and formal with the st quintins said my mother she was right in the general admonition and had i found them all seated in the best drawingroom mrs st quintin in her best attire and the children on their best behaviour i should have been as stately as don quixote in a brocade dressinggown but finding them in such dishabille i could not affect too great a plainness and almost coarseness of bearing as if i had never been accustomed to any thing more refined than i found there nor might i by any appearance of pride in myself put them in mind of the wound their own pride had received the difficulty was to blend with this familiarity a certain respect just the same as a french ambassador might have testified towards the august person of george the third had he found his majesty at dinner at one oclock over mutton and turnips in overcoming this difficulty i congratulated myself with as much zeal and fervour as if i had performed the most important victory for whether it be innocent or sanguinary in war or at an election there is no triumph so gratifying to the viciousness of human nature as the conquest of our fellow beings but i must return to my winemerchant mr briggs his house was at the entrance of the town of buyemall it stood inclosed in a small garden flaming with crocuses and sunflowers and exhibiting an arbour to the right where in the summer evenings the respectable owner might be seen with his waistcoat unbuttoned in order to give that just and rational liberty to the subordinate parts of the human commonwealth which the increase of their consequence after the hour of dinner naturally demands nor in those moments of dignified ease was the worthy burgher without the divine inspirations of complacent contemplation which the weed of virginia bestoweth there as he smoked and puffed and looked out upon the bright crocuses and meditated over the dim recollections of the hesternal journal did mr briggs revolve in his mind the vast importance of the borough of buyemall to the british empire and the vast importance of john briggs to the borough of buyemall when i knocked at the door a prettyish maidservant opened it with a smile and a glance which the vender of wine might probably have taught her himself after too large potations of his own spirituous manufactories i was ushered into a small parlourwhere sat sipping brandy and water a short stout monosyllabic sort of figure corresponding in outward shape to the name of briggseven unto a very nicety mr pelham said this gentleman who was dressed in a brown coat white waistcoat buffcoloured inexpressibles with long strings and gaiters of the same hue and substance as the breechesmr pelham pray be seatedexcuse my rising im like the bishop in the story mr pelham too old to rise and mr briggs grunted out a short quick querulous hehehe to which of course i replied to the best of my cachinnatory powers no sooner however did i begin to laugh than mr briggs stopped shorteyed me with a sharp suspicious glanceshook his head and pushed back his chair at least four feet from the spot it had hitherto occupied ominous signs thought ii must sound this gentleman a little further before i venture to treat him as the rest of his species you have a nice situation here mr briggs said i ah mr pelham and a nice vote too which is somewhat more to your purpose i believe oh thought i i see through you now mr briggsyou must not be too civil to one who suspects you are going to be civil in order to take him in why said i mr briggs to be frank with you i do call upon you for the purpose of requesting your vote give it me or not just as you please you may be sure i shall not make use of the vulgar electioneering arts to coax gentlemen out of their votes i ask you for yours as one freeman solicits another if you think my opponent a fitter person to represent your borough give your support to him in gods name if not and you place confidence in me i will at least endeavour not to betray it well done mr pelham exclaimed mr briggs i love candouryou speak just after my own heart but </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> but you must be aware that one does not like to be bamboozled out of ones right of election by a smoothtongued fellow who sends one to the devil the moment the election is overor still worse to be frightened out of it by some stiffnecked proud coxcomb with his pedigree in his hand and his acres in his face thinking he does you a marvellous honour to ask you at all sad times these for this free country mr pelham when a parcel of conceited paupers like parson quinny as i call that reverend fool mr combermere st quintin imagine they have a right to dictate to warm honest men who can buy their whole family out and out i tell you what mr pelham we shall never do anything for this country till we get rid of those landed aristocrats with their ancestry and humbug i hope youre of my mind mr pelham why answered i there is certainly nothing so respectable in great britain as our commercial interest a man who makes himself is worth a thousand men made by their forefathers very true mr pelham said the winemerchant advancing his chair to me and then laying a short thickset finger upon my armhe looked up in my face with an investigating air and saidparliamentary reformwhat do you say to that youre not an advocate for ancient abuses and modern corruption i hope mr pelham by no means cried i with an honest air of indignationi have a conscience mr briggs i have a conscience as a public man no less than as a private one admirable cried my host no i continued glowing as i proceeded no mr briggs i disdain to talk too much about my principles before they are tried the proper time to proclaim them is when they have effected some good by being put into action i wont supplicate your vote mr briggs as my opponent may do there must be a mutual confidence between my supporters and myself when i appear before you a second time you will have a right to see how far i have wronged that trust reposed in me as your representative mr briggs i dare say it may seem rude and impolitic to address you in this manner but i am a plain blunt man and i disdain the vulgar arts of electioneering mr briggs give us your fist old boy cried the wine merchant in a transport give us your fist i promise you my support and i am delighted to vote for a young gentleman of such excellent principles so much dear reader for mr briggs who became from that interview my staunchest supporter i will not linger longer upon this part of my career the above conversations may serve as a sufficient sample of my electioneering qualifications and so i shall merely add that after the due quantum of dining drinking spouting lying equivocating bribing rioting headbreaking promisebreaking andthank the god mercury who presides over electionschairing of successful candidateship i found myself fairly chosen member for the borough of buyemall </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxvii political education is like the keystone to the archthe strength of the whole depends upon itencycl britt sup art education i was sitting in the library of glenmorris castle about a week after all the bustle of contest and the eclat of victory had began to subside and quietly dallying with the dry toast which constituted then and does to this day my ordinary breakfast when i was accosted by the following speech from my uncle henry your success has opened to you a new career i trust you intend to pursue it certainly was my answer but you know my dear henry that though you have great talents which i confess i was surprised in the course of the election to discover yet they want that careful cultivation which in order to shine in the house of commons they must receive entre nous henry a litle reading would do you no harm very well said i suppose i begin with walter scotts novels i am told they are extremely entertaining true answered my uncle but they dont contain the most accurate notions of history or the soundest principles of political philosophy in the world what did you think of doing today henry nothing said i very innocently i should conceive that to be an usual answer of yours henry to any similar question i think it is replied i with great naivete well then let us have the breakfast things taken away and do something this morning willingly said i ringing the bell the table was cleared and my uncle began his examination little poor man had he thought from my usual bearing and the character of my education that in general literature there were few subjects on which i was not to the full as well read as himself i enjoyed his surprise when little by little he began to discover the extent of my information but i was mortified to find it was only surprise not delight you have said he a considerable store of learning far more than i could possibly have imagined you possessed but it is knowledge not learning in which i wish you to be skilled i would rather in order to gift you with the former that you were more destitute of the latter the object of education is to instil principles which are hereafter to guide and instruct us facts are only desirable so far as they illustrate those principles principles ought therefore to precede facts what then can we think of a system which reverses this evident order overloads the memory with facts and those of the most doubtful description while it leaves us entirely in the dark with regard to the principles which could alone render this heterogeneous mass of any advantage or avail learning without knowledge is but a bundle of prejudices a lumber of inert matter set before the threshold of the understanding to the exclusion of common sense pause for a moment and recal those of your contemporaries who are generally considered wellinformed tell me if their information has made them a whit the wiser if not it is only sanctified ignorance tell me if names with them are not a sanction for opinion quotations the representatives of axioms all they have learned only serves as an excuse for all they are ignorant of in one month i will engage that you shall have a juster and deeper insight into wisdom than they have been all their lives acquiring the great error of education is to fill the mind first with antiquated authors and then to try the principles of the present day by the authorities and maxims of the past we will pursue for our plan the exact reverse of the ordinary method we will learn the doctrines of the day as the first and most necessary step and we will then glance over those which have passed away as researches rather curious than useful you see this very small pamphlet it is a paper by mr mills upon government we will know this thoroughly and when we have done so we may rest assured that we have a far more accurate information upon the head and front of all political knowledge than twothirds of the young men whose cultivation of mind you have usually heard panegyrized so saying my uncle opened the pamphlet he pointed out to me its close and mathematical reasoning in which no flaw could be detected nor deduction controverted and he filled up as we proceeded from the science of his own clear and enlarged mind the various parts which the political logician had left for reflection to complete my uncle had this great virtue of an expositor that he never overexplained he never made a parade of his lecture nor confused what was simple by unnecessary comment when we broke off our first days employment i was quite astonished at the new light which had gleamed upon me i felt like sinbad the sailor when in wandering through the cavern in which he had been buried alive he caught the first glimpse of the bright day naturally eager in every thing i undertook fond of application and addicted to reflect over the various bearings of any object that once engrossed my attention i made great advance in my new pursuit after my uncle had brought me to be thoroughly conversant with certain and definite principles we proceeded to illustrate them from fact for instance when we had finished the essay upon government we examined into the several constitutions of england british america and france the three countries which pretend the most to excellence in their government and we were enabled to perceive and judge the defects and merits of each because we had previous to our examination established certain rules by which they were to be investigated and tried here my sceptical indifference to facts was my chief reason for readily admitting knowledge i had no prejudices to contend with no obscure notions gleaned from the past no popular maxims cherished as truths every thing was placed before me as before a wholly impartial inquirerfreed from all the decorations and delusions of sects and parties every argument was stated with logical precisionevery opinion referred to a logical test hence in a very short time i owned the justice of my uncles assurance as to the comparative concentration of knowledge we went over the whole of millss admirable articles in the encyclopaedia over the more popular works of bentham and thence we plunged into the recesses of political economy i know not why this study has been termed uninteresting no sooner had i entered upon its consideration than i could scarcely tear myself from it never from that moment to this have i ceased to pay it the most constant attention not so much as a study as an amusement but at that time my uncles object was not to make me a profound political economist i wish said he merely to give you an acquaintance with the principles of the science not that you may be entitled to boast of knowledge but that you may be enabled to avoid ignorance not that you may discover </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> discover truth but that you may detect error of all sciences political economy is contained in the fewest books and yet is the most difficult to master because all its higher branches require earnestness of reflection proportioned to the scantiness of reading mrs marsetts elementary work together with some conversational enlargement on the several topics she treats of will be enough for our present purpose i wish then to show you how inseparably allied is the great science of public policy with that of private morality and this henry is the grandest object of all now to our present study well gentle reader i love by the by as you already perceive that oldfashioned courtesy of addressing youwell to finish this part of my life which as it treats rather of my attempts at reformation than my success in error must begin to weary you exceedingly i acquired more from my uncles conversation than the books we read a sufficient acquaintance with the elements of knowledge to satisfy myself and to please my instructor and i must say in justification of my studies and my tutor that i derived one benefit from them which has continued with me to this hourviz i obtained a clear knowledge of moral principle before that time the little ability i possessed only led me into acts which i fear most benevolent reader thou hast already sufficiently condemned my good feelingsfor i was not naturally badnever availed me the least when present temptation came into my way i had no guide but passion no rule but the impulse of the moment what else could have been the result of my education if i was immoral it was because i was never taught morality nothing perhaps is less innate than virtue i own that the lessons of my uncle did not work miraclesthat living in the world i have not separated myself from its errors and its follies the vortex was too strongthe atmosphere too contagious but i have at least avoided the crimes into which my temper would most likely have driven me i ceased to look upon the world as a game one was to play fairly if possiblebut where a little cheating was readily

<chapter>chapter xxxix dicsi grave non estquae prima iratum ventrem placaverit esca horace i did not remain above a day or two in town i had never seen much of the humours of a wateringplace and my love of observing character made me exceedingly impatient for that pleasure accordingly the first bright morning i set off for cheltenham i was greatly struck with the entrance to that town it is to these wateringplaces that a foreigner should be taken in order to give him an adequate idea of the magnificent opulence and universal luxury of england our country has in every province what france only has in parisa capital consecrated to gaiety idleness and enjoyment london is both too busy in one class of society and too pompous in another to please a foreigner who has not excellent recommendations to private circles but at brighton cheltenham hastings bath he may as at paris find all the gaieties of society without knowing a single individual my carriage stopped at thehotel a corpulent and stately waiter with gold buckles to a pair of very tight pantaloons showed me up stairs i found myself in a tolerable room facing the street and garnished with two pictures of rocks and rivers with a comely flight of crows hovering in the horizon of both as natural as possible only they were a little larger than the trees over the chimneypiece where i had fondly hoped to find a lookingglass was a grave print of general washington with one hand stuck out like the spout of a teapot between the two windows unfavourable position was an oblong mirror to which i immediately hastened and had the pleasure of seeing my complexion catch the colour of the curtains that overhung the glass on each side and exhibit the pleasing rurality of a pale green i shrunk back aghast turned and beheld the waiter had i seen myself in a glass delicately shaded by rosehued curtains i should gently and smilingly have said have the goodness to bring me the bill of fare as it was i growled out bring me the bill and be dd to you the stiff waiter bowed solemnly and withdrew slowly i looked round the room once more and discovered the additional adornments of a teaurn and a book thank heaven thought i as i took up the latter it cant be one of jeremy benthams no it was the cheltenham guide i turned to the head of amusementsdress ball at the rooms every some day or otherwhich of the seven i utterly forget but it was the same as that which witnessed my first arrival in the small drawingroom of thehotel thank heaven said i to myself as bedos entered with my things and was ordered immediately to have all in preparation for the dressball at the rooms at the hour of halfpast ten the waiter entered with the bill soups chops cutlets steaks roast joints birds get some soup said i a slice or two of lion and half a dozen birds sir said the solemn waiter you cant have less than a whole lion and we have only two birds in the house pray asked i are you in the habit of supplying your larder from exeter change or do you breed lions here like poultry sir answered the grim waiter never relaxing into a smile we have lions brought us from the country every day what do you pay for them said i about three and sixpence apiece sir humphmarket in africa overstocked thought i pray how do you dress an animal of that description roast and stuff him sir and serve him up with currant jelly what like a hare it is a hare sir what yes sir it is a hare note i have since </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> since learned that this custom of calling a hare a lion is not peculiar to cheltenham at that time i was utterly unacquainted with the regulations of the london coffeehousesbut we call it a lion because of the game laws bright discovery thought i they have a new language in cheltenham nothings like travelling to enlarge the mind and the birds said i aloud are neither humming birds nor ostriches i suppose no sir they are partridges well then give me some soup a cotelette de mouton and a bird as you term it and be quick about it it shall be done with dispatch answered the pompous attendant and withdrew is there in the whole course of this pleasant and varying life which young gentlemen and ladies write verses to prove same and sorrowfulis there in the whole course of it one halfhour really and genuinely disagreeableif so it is the halfhour before dinner at a strange inn nevertheless by the help of philosophy and the window i managed to endure it with great patience and though i was famishing with hunger i pretended the indifference of a sage even when the dinner was at length announced i coquetted a whole minute with my napkin before i attempted the soup and i helped myself to the potatory food with a slow dignity that must have perfectly won the heart of the solemn waiter the soup was a little better than hot water and the sharp sauced cotelette than leather and vinegar howbeit i attacked them with the vigour of an irishman and washed them down with a bottle of the worst liquor ever dignified with the venerabile nomen of claret the bird was tough enough to have passed for an ostrich in miniature and i felt its ghost hopping about the stomachic sepulchre to which i consigned it the whole of that evening and a great portion of the next day when a glass of curacoa laid it at rest after this splendid repast i flung myself back on my chair with the complacency of a man who has dined well and dozed away the time till the hour of dressing now thought i as i placed myself before my glass shall i gently please or sublimely astonish the fashionables of cheltenham ah bah the latter school is vulgar byron spoilt it dont put out that chain bedosi wearthe black coat waistcoat and trowsers brush my hair as much out of curl as you can and give an air of graceful negligence to my tout ensemble oui monsieur je comprends answered bedos i was soon dressed for it is the design not the execution of all great undertakings which requires deliberation and delay action cannot be too prompt a chair was called and henry pelham was conveyed to the rooms </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xl now see prepared to lead the sprightly dance the lovely nymphs and well dressed youths advance the spacious room receives its jovial guest and the floor shakes with pleasing weight oppressedart of dancing page his name my lord is tyrrellrichard iii upon entering i saw several heads rising and sinking to the tune of cherry ripe a whole row of stiff necks in cravats of the most unexceptionable length and breadth were just before me a tall thin young man with dark wiry hair brushed on one side was drawing on a pair of white woodstock gloves and affecting to look round the room with the supreme indifference of bon ton ah ritson said another young cheltenhamian to him of the woodstock gauntlets havnt you been dancing yet no smith pon honour answered mr ritson it is so overpoweringly hot no fashionable man dances nowit isnt the thing why replied mr smith who was a goodnatured looking person with a blue coat and brass buttons a gold pin in his neckcloth and kneebreeches why they dance at almacks dont they no pon honour murmured mr ritson no they just walk a quadrille or spin a waltz as my friend lord bobadob calls it nothing moreno hang dancing tis so vulgar a stout redfaced man about thirty with wet auburn hair a marvellously fine waistcoat and a badlywashed frill now joined messrs ritson and smith ah sir ralph cried smith how dye do been hunting all day i suppose yes old cock replied sir ralph been after the brush till i am quite done up such a glorious run by g you should have seen my grey mare smith by g shes a glorious fencer you dont hunt do you ritson interrogated mr smith yes i do replied mr ritson affectedly playing with his woodstock glove yes but i only hunt in leicestershire with my friend lord bobadob tis not the thing to hunt any where else tis so vulgar sir ralph stared at the speaker with mute contempt while mr smith like the ass between the hay stood balancing betwixt the opposing merits of the baronet and the beau meanwhile a smiling nodding affected female thing in ringlets and flowers flirted up to the trio now reelly mr smith you should deence a feeshionable young man like youi dont know what the young leedies will say to you and the fair seducer laughed bewitchingly you are very good mrs dollimore replied mr smith with a blush and a low bow but mr ritson tells me it is not the thing to dance oh cried mrs dollimore but then hes seech a naughty conceited creaturedont follow his example meester smith and again the good lady laughed immoderately nay mrs dollimore said mr ritson passing his hand through his abominable hair you are too severe but tell me mrs dollimore is the countess st acoming here now reelly mr ritson you who are the pink of feeshion ought to know better than i can but i hear so do you know the countess said mr smith in respectful surprise to ritson oh very well replied the coryphaeus of cheltenham swinging his woodstock glove to and fro i have often danced with her at almacks is she a good deencer asked mrs dollimore o capital responded mr ritson shes such a nice genteel little figure sir ralph apparently tired of this feeshionable conversation swaggered away pray said mrs dollimore who is that geentleman sir ralph rumford replied smith eagerly a particular friend of mine at cambridge i wonder if hes going to make a long steey said mrs dollimore yes i believe so replied mr smith if we make it agreeable to him you must positively introduce him to me said mrs dollimore i will with great pleasure said the goodnatured mr smith is sir ralph a man of fashion inquired mr ritson hes a baronet emphatically pronounced mr smith ah replied ritson but he may be a man of rank without being a man of fashion true lisped mrs dollimore i dont know replied smith with an air of puzzled wonderment but he has l7000 ayear has he indeed cried mrs dollimore surprised into her natural tone of voice and at that moment a young lady ringletted and flowered like herself joined her and accosted her by the endearing appellation of mamma have you been dancing my love inquired mrs dollimore yes ma with captain johnson oh said the mother with a toss of her head and giving her daughter a significant push she walked away with her to another end of the room to talk about sir ralph rumford and his seven thousand pounds ayear well thought i odd people these let us enter a little farther into this savage country in accordance with this reflection i proceeded towards the middle of the room whos that said mr smith in a loud whisper as i passed him pon honour answered ritson i dont know but hes a deuced neat looking fellow quite genteel thank you mr ritson said my vanity you are not so offensive after all i paused to look at the dancers a middleaged respectable looking gentleman was beside me common people after they have passed forty grow social my neighbour hemmed twice and made preparation for speaking i may as well encourage him was my reflection accordingly i turned round with a most goodnatured expression of countenance a fine room this sir said the man immediately very said i with a smile and extremely well filled ah sir answered my neighbour cheltenham is not as it used to be some fifteen years ago i have seen as many as one thousand two hundred and fifty persons within these walls certain people are always so dd particularizing ay sir pursued my laudator temporis acti and half the peerage here into the bargain indeed quoth i with an air of surprise suited to the information i received but the society is very good still is it not oh very genteel replied the man but not so dashing as it used to be oh those two horrid words low enough to suit even the author of pray asked i glancing at messrs ritson and smith do you know who those gentlemen are extremely well replied my neighbour the tall young man is mr ritson his mother has a house in bakerstreet and gives quite elegant parties hes a most genteel young man but such an insufferable coxcomb and the other said i oh hes a mr smith his father was an eminent merchant and is lately dead leaving each of his sons thirty thousand pounds the young smith is a knowing hand and wants to spend his money with spirit he has a great passion for high life and therefore attaches himself much to mr ritson who is quite that way inclined he could not have selected a better model said i true rejoined my cheltenham asmodeus with naive simplicity but i hope he wont adopt his conceit as well as his elegance i shall die said i to myself if i talk with this fellow any longer and i was just going to glide away when a tall stately dowager with two lean scraggy daughters entered the room i could not resist pausing to inquire who they were my friend looked at me with a very altered and disrespectful air at this interrogation who said he why the countess of babbleton and </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> and her two daughters the honourable lady jane babel and the honourable lady mary babel they are the great people of cheltenham pursued he and its a fine thing to get into their set meanwhile lady babbleton and her two daughters swept up the room bowing and nodding to the riven ranks on each side who made their salutations with the most profound respect my experienced eye detected in a moment that lady babbleton in spite of her title and her stateliness was exceedingly the reverse of good ton and the daughters who did not resemble the scrag of mutton but its ghost had an appearance of sour affability which was as different from the manners of proper society as it possibly could be i wondered greatly who and what they were in the eyes of the cheltenhamians they were the countess and her daughters and any further explanation would have been deemed quite superfluous further explanation i was however determined to procure and was walking across the room in profound meditation as to the method in which the discovery should be made when i was startled by the voice of sir lionel garrett i turned round and to my inexpressible joy beheld that worthy baronet god bless me pelham said he how delighted i am to see you lady harriett here your old favourite mr pelham lady harriet was all smiles and pleasure give me your arm said she i must go and speak to lady babbletonodious woman do my dear lady harriett said i explain to me what lady babbleton was whyshe was a milliner and took in the late lord who was an idiotvoila tout perfectly satisfactory replied i or short and sweet as lady babbleton would say replied lady harriett laughing in antithesis to her daughters who are long and sour oh you satirist said the affected lady harriett who was only three removes better than the cheltenham countess but tell me how long have you been at cheltenham about four hours and a half then you dont know any of the lions here none well let me dispatch lady babbleton and ill then devote myself to being your nomenclator we walked up to lady babbleton who had already disposed of her daughters and was sitting in solitary dignity at the end of the room my dear lady babbleton cried lady harriett taking both the hands of the dowager i am so glad to see you and how well you are looking and your charming daughters how are theysweet girlsand how long have you been here we have only just come replied the cidevant milliner half rising and rustling her plumes in stately agitation like a nervous parrot we must conform to modern ours lady arriett though for my part i like the oldfashioned plan of dining early and finishing ones gaieties before midnight but i set the fashion of good ours as well as i can i think its a duty we owe to society lady arriett to encourage morality by our own example what else do we have rank for and so saying the counter countess drew herself up with a most edifying air of moral dignity lady harriett looked at me and perceiving that my eye said go on as plain as eye could possibly speak she continuedwhich of the wells do you attend lady babbleton all replied the patronizing dowager i like to encourage the poor people here ive no notion of being proud because one has a title lady arriett no rejoined the worthy helpmate of sir lionel garrett every body talks of your condescension lady babbleton but are you not afraid of letting yourself down by going every where oh answered the countess i admit very few into my set at home but i go out promiscuously and then looking at me she said in a whisper to lady harriett who is that nice young gentleman mr pelham replied lady harriett and turning to me formally introduced us to each other are you any relation asked the dowager to lady frances pelham only her son said i dear me replied lady babbleton how odd what a nice elegant woman she is she does not go much out does she i dont often meet her i should not think it likely that your ladyship did meet her much she does not visit promiscuously every rank has its duty said lady harriett gravely your mother mr pelham may confine her circle as much as she pleases but the high rank of lady babbleton requires greater condescension just as the dukes of sussex and gloucester go to many places where you and i would not very true said the innocent dowager and thats a very sensible remark were you at bath last winter mr pelham continued the countess whose thoughts wandered from subject to subject in the most rudderless manner no lady babbleton i was unfortunately at a less distinguished place what was that paris oh indeed ive never been abroad i dont think persons of a certain rank should leave england they should stay at home and encourage their own manufactories ah cried i taking hold of lady babbletons shawl what a pretty manchester pattern this is manchester pattern exclaimed the petrified peeress why it is real cachemere you dont think i wear any thing english mr pelham i beg your ladyship ten thousand pardons i am no judge of dress but to returni am quite of your opinion that we ought to encourage our own manufactories and not go abroad but one cannot stay long on the continent even if one is decoyed there one soon longs for home again very sensibly remarked rejoined lady babbleton thats what i call true patriotism and morality i wish all the young men of the present day were like you oh dearheres a great favourite of mine coming this waymr ritsondo you know him shall i introduce you god forbid exclaimed ifrightened out of my wits and my manners come lady harriett let us rejoin sir lionel and swift at the word lady harriett retook my arm nodded her adieu to lady babbleton and withdrew with me to an obscurer part of the room here we gave way to our laughter for some time till at last getting weary of the cheltenham cleopatra i reminded lady harriett of her promise to name to me the various personages of the assemblage eh bien began lady harriett dabord you observe that very short person somewhat more than inclined to enbonpoint what that thing like a chinese tumblerthat peg of old clothesthat one foot square of mortality with an aquaticvolucrine face like a spoonbill the very same said lady harriett laughing she is a lady gander she professes to be a patroness of literature and holds weekly soirees in london for all the newspaper poets she also falls in love every year and then she employs her minstrels to write sonnets her son has a most filial tenderness for a jointure of l10000 ayear which she casts away on these feasts and follies and in order to obtain it declares the good lady to be insane half of her friends he has bribed or persuaded to be of his opinion the other half stoutly maintain her rationality and in fact she herself is divided in her own opinion as to the case for she is in the habit of drinking to a most unsentimental excess and when the fit of intoxication is upon her she confesses to the charge brought against hersupplicates for mercy and brandy and totters to bed with the air of a magdalene but when she recovers the next morning the whole scene is changed she is an injured woman a persecuted saint a female sophoclesdeclared to be mad only because she is a miracle poor harry darlington called upon her in town the other day he found her sitting in a large chair and surrounded by a whole host of hangerson who were disputing by no means sotto voce whether lady gander was mad or not henry was immediately appealed tonow is not this a proof of insanity said oneis not this a mark of compos mentis cried another i appeal to you mr darlington exclaimed all meanwhile the object of the conversation sate in a state of maudlin insensibility turning her head first on one side and then on the other and nodding to all the disputants as if agreeing with each but enough of her do you observe that lady in good heavens exclaimed i starting up is thatcan that be tyrrell whats the matter with the man cried lady harriett i quickly recovered my presence of mind and reseated myself pray forgive me lady harriett said i but i think nay i am sure i see a person i once met under very particular circumstances do you observe that dark man in deep mourning who has just entered the room and is now speaking to sir ralph rumford i do it is sir john tyrrell replied lady harriett he only came to cheltenham yesterday his is a very singular history what is it said i eagerly why he was the only son of a younger branch of the tyrrells a very old family as the name denotes he was a great deal in a certain roue set for some years and was celebrated for his affaires du coeur his fortune was however perfectly unable to satisfy his expenses he took to gambling and lost the remains of his property he went abroad and used to be seen at the low gaming houses at paris earning a very degraded and precarious subsistence till about three months ago two persons who stood between him and the title and estates of the family died and most unexpectedly he succeeded to both they say that he was found in the most utter penury and distress in a small cellar at paris however that may be he is now sir john tyrrell with a very large income and in spite of a certain coarseness of manner probably acquired by the low company he latterly kept he is very much liked and even admired by the few good people in the society of cheltenham at this instant tyrrell passed us he </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> he caught my eye stopped short and coloured violently i bowed he seemed undecided for a moment as to the course he should adopt it was but for a moment he returned my salutation with great appearance of cordiality shook me warmly by the hand expressed himself delighted to meet me inquired where i was staying and said he should certainly call upon me with this promise he glided on and was soon lost among the crowd where did you meet him said lady harriett at paris what was he in decent society there i dont know said i good night lady harriett and with an air of extreme lassitude i took my hat and vanished from that motley mixture of the fashionably low and the vulgarly genteel </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xli full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath unto bondage drawn my too diligent eyes but you oh you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creatures bestshakspeare thou wilt easily conceive my dear reader who hast been in my confidence throughout the whole of this history and whom though as yet thou hast cause to esteem me but lightly i already love as my familiar and my friendthou wilt easily conceive my surprise at meeting so unexpectedly with my old hero of the gambling house i felt indeed perfectly stunned at the shock of so singular a change in his circumstances since i had last met him my thoughts reverted immediately to that scene and to the mysterious connection between tyrrell and glanville how would the latter receive the intelligence of his enemys good fortune was his vengeance yet satisfied or through what means could it now find vent a thousand thoughts similar to these occupied and distracted my attention till morning when i summoned bedos into the room to read me to sleep he opened a play of monsieur delavignes and at the beginning of the second scene i was in the land of dreams i woke about two oclock dressed sipped my chocolate and was on the point of arranging my hat to the best advantage when i received the following note my dear pelham me tibi commendo i heard this morning at your hotel that you were here my heart was a house of joy at the intelligence i called upon you two hours ago but like antony you revel long o nights ah that i could add with shakspeare that you were notwithstanding up i have just come from paris that umbilicus terrae and my adventures since i saw you for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know but you must satisfy me with a meeting till you do the mighty gods defend you vincent the hotel from which vincent dated this epistle was in the same street as my own caravansera and to this hotel i immediately set off i found my friend sitting before a huge folio which he in vain endeavoured to persuade me that he seriously intended to read we greeted each other with the greatest cordiality but how said vincent after the first warmth of welcome had subsided how shall i congratulate you upon your new honours i was not prepared to find you grown from a roue into a senator in gathering votes you were not slack now stand as tightly by your tack neer show your lug an fidge your back an hum an haw but raise your arm an tell your crack before them a so saith burns advice which being interpreted meaneth that you must astonish the rats of st stephens alas said i all ones claptraps in that house must be baited nay but a rat bites at any cheese from gloucester to parmasan and you can easily scrape up a bit of some sort talking of the house do you see by the paper that the civic senator alderman w is at cheltenham i was not aware of it i suppose hes cramming speeches and turtle for the next season how wonderfully said vincent your city dignities unloose the tongue directly a man has been a mayor he thinks himself qualified for a tully at least faith venables asked me one day what was the latin for spouting and i told him hippomanes or a raging humour in mayors after i had paid through the medium of my risible muscles due homage to this witticism of vincents he shut up his folio called for his hat and we sauntered down into the street as we passed by one of the libraries a whole mob of the dandies of the last night were lounging about the benches placed before the shop windows pray vincent said i remark those worthies and especially that tall meagre youth in the blue frockcoat and the buff waistcoat he is mr ritson the de rous viz the finished gentleman of the place i see him answered vincent he seems a most happy mixture of native coarseness and artificial decoration he puts me in mind of the picture of the great ox set in a gilt frame or a made dish in bloomsburysquare garnished with cut carrots by way of adornment said i or a flannel petticoat with a fine crape over it added vincent well well these imitators are after all not worse than the originals when do you go up to town not till my senatorial duties require me do you stay here till then as it pleases the gods but good heavens vincent what a beautiful girl vincent turned o dea certe murmured he and stopped the object of our exclamations was standing by a corner shop apparently waiting for some one within her face at the moment i first saw her was turned full towards me never had i seen any countenance half so lovely she was apparently about twenty her hair was of the richest chesnut and a golden light played through its darkness as if a sunbeam had been caught in those luxuriant tresses and was striving in vain to escape her eyes were of a light hazel large deep and shaded into softness to use a modern expression by long and very dark lashes her complexion alone would have rendered her beautiful it was so clearso pure the blood blushed beneath it like roses under a clear stream if in order to justify my simile roses would have the complacency to grow in such a situation her nose was of that fine and accurate mould that one so seldom sees except in the grecian statues which unites the clearest and most decided outline with the most feminine delicacy and softness and the short curved arch which descended from thence to her mouth was so fineso airily and exquisitely formed that it seemed as if love himself had modelled the bridge which led to his most beautiful and fragrant island on the right side of the mouth was one dimple which corresponded so exactly with every smile and movement of those rosy lips that you might have sworn the shadow of each passed there it was like the rapid changes of an april heaven reflected upon a valley she was somewhat but not much taller that the ordinary height and her figure which united all the first freshness and youth of the girl with the more luxuriant graces of the woman was rounded and finished so justly so minutely that the eye could glance over the whole without discovering the least harshness or unevenness or atom to be added or subtracted but over all these was a light a glow a pervading spirit of which it is impossible to convey the faintest idea you should have seen her by the side of a shaded fountain on a summers day you should have watched her amidst music and flowers and she might have seemed to you like the fairy that presided over both so much for poetical description what think you of her vincent said i i say with theocritus in his epithalamium of helen say no such thing said i i will not have her presence profaned by any helps from your memory at that moment the girl turned round abruptly and reentered the shop at the door of which she had been standing it was a small perfumers shop thank heaven said i that she does use perfumes what scents can she now be hesitating betweenthe gentle bouquet du roi the cooling esprit de portugal the mingled treasures des mellifleurs the less distinct but agreeably adulterated miel the sweet mayrecalling esprit des violets or the omnis copia narium said vincent let us enter i want some eau de cologne i desired no second invitation we marched into the shop my armida was leaning on the arm of an old lady she blushed deeply when she saw us enter and as illluck would have it the old lady concluded her purchases the moment after and they withdrew who had thought this clime had held a deity so unparalleld justly observed my companion i made no reply all the remainder of that day i was absent and reserved and vincent perceiving that i no longer laughed at his jokes nor smiled at his quotations told me i was sadly changed for the worse and pretended an engagement to rid himself of an auditor so obtuse </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlii tout notre mal vient de ne pouvoir etre seuls de la le jeu le luxe la dissipation le vin les femmes lignorance la medisance lenvie loubli de soimeme et de dieula bruyere the next day i resolved to call upon tyrrell seeing that he had not yet kept his promise of anticipating me and being very desirous not to lose any opportunity of improving my acquaintance with him accordingly i sent my valet to make inquiries as to his abode i found that he lodged in the same hotel as myself and having previously ascertained that he was at home i made up my features into their most winning expression and was ushered by the head waiter into the gamesters apartment he was sitting by the fire in a listless yet thoughtful attitude his muscular and rather handsome person was indued in a dressinggown of </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> of rich brocade thrown on with a slovenly nonchalance his stockings were about his heels his hair was dishevelled and the light streaming through the halfdrawn windowcurtains rested upon the grey flakes with which its darker luxuriance was interspersed and the cross light in which he had the imprudence or misfortune to sit odious cross light which even i already begin carefully to avoid fully developed the deep wrinkles which years and dissipation had planted round his eyes and mouth i was quite startled at the oldness and haggardness of his appearance he rose gracefully enough when i was announced and no sooner had the waiter retired than he came up to me shook me warmly by the hand and said let me thank you now for the attention you formerly shewed me when i was less able to express my acknowledgments i shall be proud to cultivate your intimacy i answered him in the same strain and in the course of conversation made myself so entertaining that he agreed to spend the remainder of the day with me we ordered our horses at three and our dinner at seven and i left him till the former were ready in order to allow him time for his toilet during our ride we talked principally on general subjects on the various differences of france and england on horses on wines on women on politics on all things except that which had created our acquaintance his remarks were those of a strong illregulated mind which had made experience supply the place of the reasoning faculties there was a looseness in his sentiments and a licentiousness in his opinions which startled even me used as i had been to rakes of all schools his philosophy was of that species which thinks that the best maxim of wisdom isto despise of men he spoke with the bitterness of hatred of women with the levity of contempt france had taught him its debaucheries but not the elegance which refines them if his sentiments were low the language in which they were clothed was meaner still and that which makes the morality of the upper classes and which no criminal is supposed to be hardy enough to reject that religion which has no scoffers that code which has no impugners that honour among gentlemen which constitutes the moving principle of the society in which they live he seemed to imagine even in its most fundamental laws was an authority to which nothing but the inexperience of the young and the credulity of the romantic could accede upon the whole he seemed to me a bold bad man with just enough of intellect to teach him to be a villain without that higher degree which shews him that it is the worst course for his interest and just enough of daring to make him indifferent to the dangers of guilt though it was not sufficient to make him conquer and control them for the rest he loved trotting better than canteringpiqued himself upon being manlywore doeskin glovesdrank port wine par preference and considered beefsteaks and oysters as the most delicate dish in the whole carte i think now reader you have a tolerably good view of his character after dinner when we were discussing the second bottle i thought it would not be a bad opportunity to question him upon his acquaintance with glanville his countenance fell directly i mentioned that name however he rallied himself oh said he you mean the soidisant warburton i knew him some years backhe was a poor silly youth half mad i believe and particularly hostile to me owing to some foolish disagreement when he was quite a boy what was the cause said i nothingnothing of any consequence answered tyrrell and then added with an air of coxcombry i believe i was more fortunate than he in an affaire du coeur poor granville is a little romantic you know but enough of this now shall we go to the rooms with pleasure said i and to the rooms we went </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xliii veteres revocavit arteshorace since i came hither i have heard strange newsking lear two days after my long conversation with tyrrell i called again upon that worthy to my great surprise he had left cheltenham i then strolled to vincent i found him lolling on his sofa surrounded as usual with books and papers come in pelham said he as i hesitated at the thresholdcome in i have been delighting myself with plato all the morning i scarcely know what it is that enchants us so much with the ancients i rather believe with schlegel that it is that air of perfect reposethe stillness of a deep soul which rests over their writings whatever would appear commonplace amongst us has with them i know not what of sublimity and pathos triteness seems the profundity of truthwildness the daring of a luxuriant imagination the fact is that in spite of every fault you see through all the traces of original thought there is a contemplative grandeur in their sentiments which seems to have nothing borrowed in its meaning or its dress take for instance this fragment of mimnermus on the shortness of lifewhat subject can seem more tamewhat less striking than the feelings he expressesand yet throughout every line there is a melancholy depth and tenderness which it is impossible to define of all english writers who partake the most of this spirit of conveying interest and strength to sentiments subjects and language neither novel in themselves nor adorned in their arrangement i know none that equal byron it is indeed the chief beauty of that extraordinary poet examine childe harold accurately and you will be surprised to discover how very little of real depth or novelty there often is in the reflections which seem most deep and new you are enchained by the vague but powerful beauty of the style the strong impress of originality which breathes throughout like the oracle of dodona he makes the forest his tablets and writes his inspirations upon the leaves of the trees but the source of that inspiration you cannot tell it is neither the truth nor the beauty of his sayings which you admire though you fancy that it is it is the mystery which accompanies them pray said i stretching myself listlessly on the opposite sofa to vincent do you not imagine that one great cause of this spirit of which you speak and which seems to be nothing more than a thoughtful method of expressing all things even to trifles was the great loneliness to which the ancient poets and philosophers were attached i think though i have not your talent for quoting that cicero calls the consideratio naturae the pabulum animi and the mind which in solitude is confined necessarily to a few objects meditates more closely upon those it embraces the habit of this meditation enters and pervades the system and whatever afterwards emanates from it is tinctured with the thoughtful and contemplative colours it has received heus domine cried vincent how long have you learnt to read cicero and talk about the mind ah said i i am perhaps less ignorant than i affect to be it is now my object to be a dandy hereafter i may aspire to be an oratora wit a scholar or a vincent you will see then that there have been many odd quarters of an hour in my life less unprofitably wasted than you imagine vincent rose in a sort of nervous excitement and then reseating himself fixed his dark bright eyes steadfastly upon me for some moments his countenance all the while assuming a higher and graver expression than i had ever before seen it wear pelham said he at last it is for the sake of moments like these when your better nature flashes out that i have sought your society and your friendship i too am not wholly what i appear the world may yet see that halifax was not the only statesman whom the pursuits of literature had only formed the better for the labours of business meanwhile let me pass for the pedant and the bookworm like a sturdier adventurer than myself i bide my timepelhamthis will be a busy session shall you prepare for it nay answered i relapsing into my usual tone of languid affectation i shall have too much to do in attending to stultz and nugee and tattersall and baxter and a hundred other occupiers of spare time remember this is my first season in london since my majority vincent took up the newspaper with evident chagrin however he was too theoretically the man of the world long to shew his displeasure parrparragain said he how they stuff the journals with that name god knows i venerate learning as much as any man but i respect it for its uses and not for itself however i will not quarrel with his reputationit is but for a day literary men who leave nothing but their name to posterity have but a short twilight of posthumous renown apropos do you know my pun upon parr and the major not i said i majora canamus why parr and i and two or three more were dining once at poor t ms the author of the indian antiquitiesmajor a great traveller entered into a dispute with parr about babylon the doctor got into a violent passion and poured out such a heap of quotations on his unfortunate antagonist that the latter stunned by the clamour and terrified by the greek was obliged to succumb parr turned triumphantly to me what is your opinion my lord said he who is in the right adversis majorpar secundis answered i vincent i said after i had expressed sufficient admiration at his punvincent i begin to be weary of this life i shall accordingly pack up my books and myself and go to malvern wells to live quietly till i think it time for london after today you will therefore see me no more i cannot answered vincent contravene so laudable a purpose however i may be the loser and after a short and desultory conversation i left him once more to the tranquil enjoyment of his plato that evening i went </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> went to malvern and there i remained in a monotonous state of existence dividing my time equally between my mind and my body and forming myself into that state of contemplative reflection which was the object of vincents admiration in the writings of the ancients just when i was on the point of leaving my retreat i received an intelligence which most materially affected my future prospects my uncle who had arrived to the sober age of fifty without any apparent designs of matrimony fell suddenly in love with a lady in his immediate neighbourhood and married her after a courtship of three weeks i should not said my poor mother very generously in a subsequent letter so much have minded his marriage if the lady had not thought proper to become in the family way a thing which i do and always shall consider a most unwarrantable encroachment on your rights i will confess that on first hearing this news i experienced a bitter pang but i reasoned it away i was already under great obligations to my uncle and i felt it a very unjust and ungracious assumption on my part to affect anger at conduct i had no right to question or mortification at the loss of pretensions i had so equivocal a privilege to form a man of fifty has perhaps a right to consult his own happiness almost as much as a man of thirty and if he attracts by his choice the ridicule of those whom he has never obliged it is at least from those persons he has obliged that he is to look for countenance and defence fraught with these ideas i wrote to my uncle a sincere and warm letter of congratulation his answer was like himself kind affectionate and generous it informed me that he had already made over to me the annual sum of one thousand pounds and that in case of his having a lineal heir he had moreover settled upon me after his death two thousand ayear he ended by assuring me that his only regret at marrying a lady who in all respects was above all women calculated to make him happy was his unfeigned reluctance to deprive me of a station which he was pleased to say i not only deserved but should adorn upon receiving this letter i was sensibly affected with my uncles kindness and so far from repining at his choice i most heartily wished him every blessing it could afford him even though an heir to the titles of glenmorris were one of them i protracted my stay at malvern some weeks longer than i had intended the circumstance which had wrought so great a change in my fortune wrought no less powerfully on my character i became more thoughtfully and solidly ambitious instead of wasting my time in idle regrets at the station i had lost i rather resolved to carve out for myself one still loftier and more universally acknowledged i determined to exercise to their utmost the little ability and knowledge i possessed and while the increase of income derived from my uncles generosity furnished me with what was necessary for my luxury i was resolved that it should not encourage me in the indulgence of my indolence in this mood and with these intentions i repaired to the metropolis

theretoromaunt of the rose how well i can remember the feelings with which i entered london and took possession of the apartments prepared for me at mivarts a year had made a vast alteration in my mind i had ceased to regard pleasure for its own sake i rather coveted its enjoyments as the great sources of worldly distinction i was not the less a coxcomb than heretofore nor the less a voluptuary nor the less choice in my perfumes nor the less fastidious in my horses and my dress but i viewed these matters in a light wholly different from that in which i had hitherto regarded them beneath all the carelessness of my exterior my mind was close keen and inquiring and under the affectations of foppery and the levity of a manner almost unique for the effeminacy of its tone i veiled an ambition the most extensive in its object and a resolution the most daring in the accomplishment of its means i was still lounging over my breakfast on the second morning of my arrival when mr n the tailor was announced good morning mr pelham happy to see you returned do i disturb you too early shall i wait on you again no mr n i am ready to receive you you may renew my measure we are a very good figure mr pelham very good figure replied the schneider surveying me from head to foot while he was preparing his measure we want a little assistance though we must be padded well here we must have our chest thrown out and have an additional inch across the shoulders we must live for effect in this world mr pelham a leetle tighter round the waist eh mr n said i you will take first my exact measure and secondly my exact instructions have you done the first we are done now mr pelham replied my manmaker in a slow solemn tone you will have the goodness then to put no stuffing of any description in my coat you will not pinch me an iota tighter across the waist than is natural to that part of my body and you will please in your infinite mercy to leave me as much after the fashion in which god made me as you possibly can but sir we must be padded we are much too thin all the gentlemen in the life guards are padded sir mr n answered i you will please to speak of us with a separate and not a collective pronoun and you will let me for once have my clothes such as a gentleman who i beg of you to understand is not a life guardsman can wear without being mistaken for a guy fawkes on a fifth

instruction too if we can but find it out maxims 1 do not require your dress so much to fit as to adorn you nature is not to be copied but to be exalted by art apelles blamed protogenes for being too natural 2 never in your dress altogether desert that taste which is general the world considers eccentricity in great things genius in small things folly 3 always remember that you dress to fascinate others not yourself 4 keep your mind free from all violent affections at the hour of the toilet a philosophical serenity is perfectly necessary to success helvetius says justly that our errors arise from our passions 5 remember that none but those whose courage is unquestionable can venture to be effeminate it was only in the field that the lacedemonians were accustomed to use perfumes and curl their hair 6 never let the finery of chains and rings seem your own choice that which naturally belongs to women should appear only worn for their sake we dignify foppery when we invest it with a sentiment 7 to win the affection of your mistress appear negligent in your costumeto preserve it assiduous the first is a sign of the passion of love the second of its respect 8 a man must be a profound calculator to be a consummate dresser one must not dress the same whether one goes to a minister or a mistress an avaricious uncle or an ostentatious cousin there is no diplomacy more subtle than that of dress 9 is the great man whom you would conciliate a coxcombgo to him in a waistcoat like his own imitation says the author of lacon is the sincerest flattery 10 the handsome may be shewy in dress the plain should study to be unexceptionable just as in great men we look for something to admirein ordinary men we ask for nothing to forgive 11 there is a study of dress for the aged as well as for the young inattention is no less indecorous in one than in the other we may distinguish the taste appropriate to each by the reflection that youth is made to be lovedage to be respected 12 a fool may dress gaudily but a fool cannot dress wellfor to dress well requires judgment and rochefaucault says with truth on est quelquefois un sot avec de lesprit mais on ne lest jamais avec du jugement 13 </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> 13 there may be more pathos in the fall of a collar or the curl of a lock than the shallow think for should we be so apt as we are now to compassionate the misfortunes and to forgive the insincerity of charles i if his pictures had pourtrayed him in a bob wig and a pigtail vandyke was a greater sophist than hume 14 the most graceful principle of dress is neatnessthe most vulgar is preciseness 15 dress contains the two codes of moralityprivate and public attention is the duty we owe to otherscleanliness that which we owe to ourselves 16 dress so that it may never be said of you what a well dressed manbut what a gentlemanlike man 17 avoid many colours and seek by some one prevalent and quiet tint to sober down the others apelles used only four

<chapter>chapter xlv tantot monseigneur le marquis a chevaltantot monsieur du mazin de boutlart de se promener a cheval my cabriolet was at the door and i was preparing to enter when i saw a groom managing with difficulty a remarkably fine and spirited horse as at that time i was chiefly occupied with the desire of making as perfect an equine collection as my fortune would allow i sent my cab boy vulgo tiger to inquire of the groom whether the horse was to be sold and to whom it belonged it was not to be disposed of was the answer and it belonged to sir reginald glanville the name thrilled through me i drove after the groom and inquired sir reginald glanvilles address his house the groom whose dark coloured livery was the very perfection of a right judgment informed me was at nopall mall i resolved to call that morning but first i drove to lady rosevilles to talk about almacks and the beau monde and be initiated into the newest scandal and satire of the day lady roseville was at home i found the room half full of women the beautiful countess was one of the few persons extant who admit people of a morning she received me with marked kindness seeing that who was esteemed among his friends the handsomest man of the day had risen from his seat next to lady roseville in order to make room for me i negligently and quietly dropped into it and answered his grave and angry stare at my presumption with my very sweetest and most condescending smile heaven be praised the handsomest man of the day is never the chief object in the room when henry pelham and his guardian angel termed by his enemies his selfesteem once enter it charming collection you have here dear lady roseville said i looking round the room quite a museum but who is that very polite gentlemanlike young man who has so kindly relinquished his seat to methough it quite grieves me to take it from him added i at the same time leaning back with a comfortable projection of the feet and establishing myself more securely in my usurped chair pour lamour de dieu tell me the on dits of the day good heavens what an unbecoming glass that is placed just opposite to me too could it not be removed while i stay here oh by the by lady roseville do you patronize the bohemian glasses for my part i have one which i only look at when i am out of humour it throws such a lovely flush upon the complexion that it revives my spirits for the rest of the day alas lady roseville i am looking much paler than when i saw you at garrett park but youyou are like one of those beautiful flowers which bloom the brightest in the winter thank heaven mr pelham said lady roseville laughing that you allow me at last to say one word you have learned at least the art of making the frais of the conversation since your visit to paris i understand you answered i you mean that i talk too much it is truei own the offencenothing is so unpopular even i the civilest best natured most unaffected person in all europe am almost disliked positively disliked for that sole and simple crime ah the most beloved man in society is that deaf and dumb person comment sappelletil yes said lady roseville popularity is a goddess best worshipped by negatives and the fewer claims one has to be admired the more pretensions one has to be beloved perfectly true in general said ifor instance i make the rule and you the exception i a perfect paragon am hated because i am one you a perfect paragon are idolized in spite of it but tell me what literary news is there i am tired of the trouble of idleness and in order to enjoy a little dignified leisure intend to set up as a savant oh lady cbis going to write a commentary on ude and madame de genlis a proof of the apocrypha the duke of ne is publishing a treatise on tolerationand lord ly an essay on selfknowledgeas for news more remote i hear that the dey of algiers is finishing an ode to libertyand the college of caffraria preparing a volume of voyages to the north pole now said i if i retail this information with a serious air i will lay a wager that i find plenty of believers for falsehood uttered solemnly is much more like probability than truth uttered doubtingly else how do the priests of brama and mahomet live ah now you grow too profound mr pelham cest vraibut tell me interrupted lady roseville how it happens that you who talk eruditely enough upon matters of erudition should talk so lightly upon matters of levity why said i rising to depart very great minds are apt to think that all which they set any value upon is of equal importance thus hesiod who you know was a capital poet though rather an imitator of shenstone tells us that god bestowed valour on some men and on others a genius for dancing it was reserved for me lady roseville to unite the two perfections adieu thus said i when i was once more alonethus do we play the fools with the timeuntil fate brings that which is better than folly and standing idly upon the seashore till we can catch the favouring wind which is to waft the vessel of our destiny to enterprise and fortune amuse ourselves with the weeds and the pebbles which are within our reach </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlvi there was a youth who as with toil and travel had grown quite weak and grey before his time nor any could the restless grief unravel which burned within him withering up his prime and goading him like fiends from land to landp b shelley from lady rosevilles i went to glanvilles house he was at home i was ushered into a beautiful apartment hung with rich damask and interspersed with a profusion of mirrors which enchanted me to the heart beyond to the right of this room was a small boudoir fitted up with books and having instead of carpets soft cushions of dark green velvet so as to supersede the necessity of chairs this room evidently a favourite retreat was adorned at close intervals with girandoles of silver and motherofpearl and the interstices of the bookcases were filled with mirrors set in silver the handles of the doors were of the same metal beyond this library if such it might be called and only divided from it by halfdrawn curtains of the same colour and material as the cushion was a bath room the decorations of this room were of a delicate rose colour the bath which was of the most elaborate workmanship represented in the whitest marble a shell supported by two tritons there was as glanville afterwards explained to me a machine in this room which kept up a faint but perpetual breeze and the light curtains waving to and fro scattered about perfumes of the most exquisite odour through this luxurious chamber i was led by the obsequious and bowing valet into a fourth room in which opposite to a toilet of massive gold and negligently robed in his dressinggown sate reginald glanvillegood heavens thought i as i approached him can this be the man who made his residence par choix in a miserable hovel exposed to all the damps winds and vapours that the prolific generosity of an english heaven ever begot our meeting was cordial in the extreme glanville though still pale and thin appeared in much better health than i had yet seen him since our boyhood he was or affected to be in the most joyous spirits and when his dark blue eye lighted up in answer to the merriment of his lips and his noble and glorious cast of countenance shone out as if it had never been clouded by grief or passion i thought as i looked at him that i had never seen so perfect a specimen of masculine beauty at once physical and intellectual my dear pelham said glanville let us see a great deal of each other i live very much alone i have an excellent cook sent me over from france by </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> by the celebrated gourmand marechal de i dine every day exactly at eight and never accept an invitation to dine elsewhere my table is always laid for three and you will therefore be sure of finding a dinner here every day you have no better engagement what think you of my taste in furnishing i have only to say answered i that since i am so often to dine with you i hope your taste in wines will be one half as good we are all said glanville with a faint smile we are all in the words of the true old proverb children of a larger growthour first toy is loveour second display according as our ambition prompts us to exert it some place it in horsessome in honours some in feasts and somevoici un exemplein furniture so true it is pelham that our earliest longings are the purest in love we covet goods for the sake of the one beloved in display for our own thus our first stratum of mind produces fruit for others our second becomes niggardly and bears only sufficient for ourselves but enough of my moralswill you drive me out if i dress quicker than you ever saw man dress before no said i for i make it a rule never to drive out a badly dressed friend take time and i will let you accompany me so be it then do you ever read if so my books are made to be opened and you may toss them over while i am at my toilet you are very good said i but i never do read lookhere said glanville are two works one of poetryone on the catholic questionboth dedicated to me seymourmy waistcoat see what it is to furnish a house differently from other people one becomes a bel esprit and a mecaenas immediately believe me if you are rich enough to afford it that there is no passport to fame like eccentricity seymourmy coat i am at your service pelham believe hereafter that one may dress well in a short time one may do it but not twoallons i observed that glanville was dressed in the deepest mourning and imagined from that circumstance and his accession to the title i heard applied to him for the first time that his father was only just dead in this opinion i was soon undeceived he had been dead for some years glanville spoke to me of his familyto my mother said he i am particularly anxious to introduce youof my sister i say nothing i expect you to be surprised with her i love her more than any thing on earth now and as glanville said this a paler shade passed over his face we were in the parklady roseville passed uswe both bowed to her as she returned our greeting i was struck with the deep and sudden blush which overspread her countenance can that be for me thought i i looked towards glanville his countenance had recovered its serenity and was settled into its usual proud but not displeasing calmness of expression do you know lady roseville well said i very answered glanville laconically and changed the conversation as we were leaving the park through cumberland gate we were stopped by a blockade of carriages a voice loud harsh and vulgarly accented called out to glanville by his name i turned and saw thornton for gods sake pelham drive on cried glanville let me for once escape that atrocious plebeian thornton was crossing the road towards us i waved my hand to him civilly enough for i never cut any body and drove rapidly through the other gate without appearing to notice his design of speaking to us thank heaven said glanville and sunk back in a reverie from which i could not awaken him till he was set down at his own door when i returned to mivarts i found a card from lord dawton and a letter from my mother my dear henry began the letter lord dawton having kindly promised to call upon you personally with this note i cannot resist the opportunity that promise affords me of saying how desirous i am that you should cultivate his acquaintance he is you know among the most prominent leaders of the opposition and should the whigs by any possible chance ever come into power he would have a great chance of becoming prime minister i trust however that you will not adopt that side of the question the whigs are a horrid set of people politically speaking vote for the roman catholics and never get into place they give very good dinners however and till you have decided upon your politics you may as well make the most of them i hope by the by that you see a great deal of lord vincent every one speaks highly of his talents and only two weeks ago he said publicly that he thought you the most promising young man and the most naturally clever person he had ever met i hope that you will be attentive to your parliamentary duties and oh henry be sure that you see cartwright the dentist as soon as possible i intend hastening to london three weeks earlier than i had intended in order to be useful to you i have written already to dear lady roseville begging her to introduce you at lady cs and lady the only places worth going to at present they tell me there is a horrid vulgar ignorant book come out about as you ought to be well versed in modern literature i hope you will read it and give me your opinion adieu my dear henry ever your affectionate mother frances pelham i was still at my solitary dinner when the following note was brought me from lady roseville dear mr pelham lady frances wishes lady cto be made acquainted with you this is her night and i therefore enclose you a card as i dine athouse i shall have an opportunity of making your eloge before your arrival yours sincerely c roseville i wonder thought i as i made my toilet whether or not lady roseville is enamoured with her new correspondent i went very early and before i retired my vanity was undeceived lady roseville was playing at ecarte when i entered she beckoned to me to approach i did her antagonist was mr bedford a natural son of the duke of shrewsbury and one of the best natured and best looking dandies about town there was of course a great crowd round the table lady roseville played incomparably bets were high in her favour suddenly her countenance changedher hand trembledher presence of mind forsook her she lost the game i looked up and saw just opposite to her but apparently quite careless and unmoved reginald glanville we had only time to exchange nods for lady roseville rose from the table took my arm and walked to the other end of the room in order to introduce me to my hostess i spoke to her a few words but she was absent and inattentive my penetration required no farther proof to convince me that she was not wholly insensible to the attentions of glanville ladywas as civil and silly as the generality of lady blanks are and feeling very much bored i soon retired to an obscurer corner of the room here glanville joined me it is but seldom said he that i come to these places tonight my sister persuaded me to venture forth is she here said i she is answered he she has just gone into the refreshment room with my mother and when she returns i will introduce you while glanville was yet speaking three middleaged ladies who had been talking together with great vehemence for the last ten minutes approached us which is hewhich is he said two of them in no inaudible accents this replied the third and coming up to glanville she addressed him to my great astonishment in terms of the most hyperbolical panegyric your work is wonderful wonderful said she oh quitequite echoed the other two i cant say recommenced the coryphoea that i like the moralat least not quite no not quite not quite repeated her coadjutrices glanville drew himself up with his most stately air and after three profound bows accompanied by a smile of the most unequivocal contempt he turned on his heel and sauntered away did your grace ever see such a bear said one of the echoes never said the duchess with a mortified air but i will have him yet how handsome he is for an author i was descending the stairs in the last state of ennui when glanville laid his hand on my shoulder shall i take you home said he my carriage has just drawn up i was too glad to answer in the affirmative how long have you been an author said i when we were seated in glanvilles carriage not many days he replied i have tried one resource after anotherallall in vain oh god that for me there could exist such a blessing as fiction must i be ever the martyr of one burning lasting indelible truth glanville uttered these words with a peculiar wildness and energy of tone he then paused abruptly for a minute and continued with an altered voicenever my dear pelham be tempted by any inducement into the pleasing errors of print from that moment you are public property and the last monster at exeter change has more liberty than you but here we are at mivarts addioi will call on you tomorrow if my wretched state of health will

inclinations by rendering myself universally scarce i saw much of vincent whose varied acquirements and great talents became more and more perceptible both as my own acquaintance with him increased and as the political events with which that year was pregnant called forth their exertion and display i went occasionally to lady rosevilles and was always treated rather as a longknown friend than an ordinary acquaintance nor did i undervalue this distinction for it was part of her pride to render her house not only as splendid but as agreeable as her command over society enabled her to effect at the house of commons my visits would have been duly paid but for one trifling occurrence upon which as it is a very sore subject i shall dwell as briefly as possible i had scarcely taken my seat before i was forced to relinquish it my unsuccessful opponent mr lufton preferred a petition against me for what he called undue means god knows what he meant i am sure the house did not for they turned me out and declared mr lufton duly elected never was there such a commotion in the glenmorris family before my uncle was seized with the gout in his stomach and my mother shut herself up with tremaine and one china monster for a whole week as for me though i writhed at heart i bore the calamity philosophically enough in external appearance nor did i the less busy myself in political matters with what address and success good or bad i endeavoured to supply the loss of my parliamentary influence the reader will see when it suits the plot of this history to touch upon such topics glanville i saw continually when in tolerable spirits he was an entertaining though never a frank nor a communicative companion his conversation then was lively yet without wit and sarcastic though without bitterness it abounded also in philosophical reflections and terse maxims which always brought improvement or at the worst allowed discussion he was a man of even vast powersof deep thoughtof luxuriant though dark imagination and of great miscellaneous though perhaps ill arranged erudition he was fond of paradoxes in reasoning and supported them with a subtlety and strength of mind which vincent who admired him greatly told me he had never seen surpassed he was subject at times to a gloom and despondency which seemed almost like aberration of intellect at those hours he would remain perfectly silent and apparently forgetful of my presence and of every object around him it was only then when the play of his countenance was vanished and his features were still and set that you saw in their full extent the dark and deep traces of premature decay his cheek was hollow and hueless his eye dim and of that visionary and glassy aspect which is never seen but in great mental or bodily disease and which according to the superstitions of some nations implies a mysterious and unearthly communion of the soul with the beings of another world from these trances he would sometimes start abruptly and renew any conversation broken off before as if wholly unconscious of the length of his reverie at others he would rise slowly from his seat and retire into his own apartment from which he never emerged during the rest of the day but the reader must bear in mind that there was nothing artificial or affected in his musings of whatever complexion they might be nothing like the dramatic brown studies and quick starts which young gentlemen in love with lara and lord byron are apt to practise there never indeed was a character that possessed less cant of any description his work which was a singular wild taleof mingled passion and reflectionwas perhaps of too original certainly of too abstract a nature to suit the ordinary novel readers of the day it did not acquire popularity for itself but it gained great reputation for the author it also inspired every one who read it with a vague and indescribable interest to see and know the person who had composed so singular a work this interest he was the first to laugh at and to disappoint he shrunk from all admiration and from all sympathy at the moment when a crowd assembled round him and every ear was bent to catch the words which came alike from so beautiful a lip and so strange and imaginative a mind it was his pleasure to utter some sentiment totally different from his written opinion and utterly destructive of the sensation he had excited but it was very rarely that he exposed himself to these trials of an author he went out little to any other house but lady rosevilles and it was seldom more than once a week that he was seen even there lonely and singular in mind and habits he lived in the world like a person occupied by a separate object and possessed of a separate existence from that of his fellowbeings he was luxurious and splendid beyond all men in his habits rather than his tastes his table groaned beneath a weight of gold too costly for the daily service even of a prince but he had no pleasure in surveying it his wines and viands were of the most exquisite description but he scarcely tasted them yet what may seem inconsistent he was averse to all ostentation and show in the eyes of others he admitted very few into his societyno one so intimately as myself i never once saw more than three persons at his table he seemed in his taste for furniture in his love of literature and his pursuit after fame to be as he himself said eternally endeavouring to forget and eternally brought back to remembrance i pity that man even more than i admire him said vincent to me one night when we were walking home from glanvilles house his is indeed the disease nulla medicabilis herba whether it is the past or the present that afflicts himwhether it is the memory of past evil or the satiety of present good he has taken to his heart the bitterest philosophy of life he does not reject its blessingshe gathers them around him but as a stone gathers mosscold hard unsoftened by the freshness and the greenness which surround it as a circle can only touch a circle in one place every thing that life presents to him wherever it comes fromto whatever portion of his soul it is appliedcan find but one point of contact and that is the soreness of affliction whether it is the oblivio or the otium that he requires he finds equally that he is for ever in want of one treasureneque gemmis neque

<chapter>chapter xlviii mons jourdain etesvous fou de laller quereller lui qui entend la tierce et la quarte et qui sait tuer un homme par raison demonstrative le maitre a danser je me moque de sa raison demonstrative et de sa tierce et de sa quartemoliere hollo my good friend how are youdd glad to see you in england vociferated a loud clear goodhumoured voice one cold morning as i was shivering down brookstreet into bondstreet i turned and beheld lord dartmore of rocher de cancale memory i returned his greeting with the same cordiality with which it was given and i was forthwith saddled with dartmores arm and dragged up bondstreet into that borough of all noisy riotous unrefined good fellowsyclepts hotel here we were soon plunged into a small low apartment which dartmore informed me was his room it was crowded with a score of masculine looking youths at whose very appearance my gentler frame shuddered from head to foot however i put as good a face on the matter as i possibly could and affected a freedom and frankness of manner correspondent with the unsophisticated tempers with which i was so unexpectedly brought into contact dartmore was still gloriously redolent of oxford his companions were all extracts from christchurch and his favourite occupations were boxing and huntingscenes at the fives courtnights in the cider cellarand mornings at bowstreet figure to yourself a fitter companion for the hero and writer of these adventures the table was covered with boxing gloves single sticks two ponderous pair of dumb bells a large pewter pot of porter and four foils one snapped in the middle well cried dartmore to two strapping youths with their coats off which was the conqueror oh it is not yet decided was the answer and forthwith the bigger one hit the lesser a blow with his boxing glove heavy enough to have felled ulysses who if i recollect aright was rather a game blood in such encounters this slight salute was forthwith the prelude to an encounter which the whole train crowded round to witness i among the rest pretending an equal ardour and an equal interest and hiding like many persons in a similar predicament a most trembling spirit beneath a most valorous exterior when the match which terminated in favour of the lesser champion was over come pelham said dartmore let me take up the gloves with you you are too good said i for the first time using my drawingroom drawl a wink and a grin went round the room well then will you fence with staunton or play at single sticks with me said the short thick bullying impudent vulgar earl of calton why answered i i am a poor hand at the foils and a still worse at the sticks but i have no objection to exchange a cut or two at the latter with lord calton no no said the goodnatured dartmoreno calton is the best stickplayer i ever knew and then whispering me he added and the hardest hitterand he never spares either really said i aloud in my most affected tone it is a great pity for i am excessively delicate but as i said i would engage him i dont like to retract pray let me look at the hilt i hope the basket is strong i would not have my knuckles rapped for the worldnow for it im in a deuced fright dartmore and so saying and inwardly chuckling at </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> at the universal pleasure depicted in the countenances of calton and the bystanders who were all rejoiced at the idea of the dandy being drubbed i took the stick and pretended great awkwardness and lack of grace in the position i chose calton placed himself in the most scientific attitude assuming at the same time an air of hauteur and nonchalance which seemed to call for the admiration it met do we make hard hitting said i oh by all means answered calton eagerly well said i settling on my own chapeau had not you better put on your hat oh no answered calton imperiously i can take pretty good care of my head and with these words we commenced i remained at first nearly upright not availing myself in the least of my superiority in height and only acting on the defensive calton played well enough for a gentleman but he was no match for one who had at the age of thirteen beat the life guardsmen at angelos suddenly when i had excited a general laugh at the clumsy success with which i warded off a most rapid attack of caltons i changed my position and keeping calton at arms length till i had driven him towards a corner i took advantage of a haughty imprudence on his part and by a common enough move in the game drew back from a stroke aimed at my limbs and suffered the whole weight of my weapon to fall so heavily upon his head that i felled him to the ground in an instant i was sorry for the severity of the stroke the moment after it was inflicted but never was punishment more deserved we picked up the discomfited hero and placed him on a chair to recover his senses meanwhile i received the congratulations of the conclave with a frank alteration of manner which delighted them and i found it impossible to get away till i had promised to dine with dartmore and spend the rest of the evening in the society of his friends </chapter>

discourse peremptory his tongue filed his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain ridiculous and thrasonical shakspeare i went a little after seven oclock to keep my dinner engagement ats for very young men are seldom unpunctual at dinner we sat down six in number to a repast at once incredibly bad and ridiculously extravagant turtle without fatvenison without flavourchampagne with the taste of a gooseberry and hock with the properties of a pomegranate note pomum valde purgatorium such is the constant habit of young men they think any thing expensive is necessarily good and they purchase poison at a dearer rate than the most medicineloving hypochondriac in england of course all the knot declared the dinner was superb called in the master to eulogize him in person and made him to his infinite dismay swallow a bumper of his own hock poor man they mistook his reluctance for his diffidence and forced him to wash it away in another potation with many a wry face of grateful humility he left the room and we then proceeded to pass the bottle with the suicidal determination of defeated romans you may imagine that we were not long in arriving at the devoutly wished for consummation of comfortable inebriety and with our eyes reeling our cheeks burning and our brave spirits full ripe for a quarrel we sallied out at eleven oclock vowing death dread and destruction to all the sober portion of his majestys subjects we came to a dead halt in arlingtonstreet which as it was the quietest spot in the neighbourhood we deemed a fitting place for the arrangement of our forces dartmore staunton a tall thin well formed silly youth and myself marched first and the remaining three followed we gave each other the most judicious admonitions as to propriety of conduct and then with a shout that alarmed the whole street we renewed our way we passed on safely enough till we got to charingcross having only been thrice upbraided by the watchmen and once threatened by two carmen of prodigious size to whose wives or sweethearts we had to our infinite peril made some gentle overtures when however we had just passed the opera colonnade we were accosted by a bevy of buxom cyprians as merry and as drunk as ourselves we halted for a few minutes in the midst of the kennel to confabulate with our new friends and a very amicable and intellectual conversation ensued dartmore was an adept in the art of slang and he found himself fairly matched by more than one of the fair and gentle creatures by whom we were surrounded just however as we were all in high glee staunton made a trifling discovery which turned the merriment of the whole scene into strife war and confusion a bouncing lass whose hands were as ready as her charms had quietly helped herself to a watch which staunton wore a la mode in his waistcoat pocket drunken as the youth was at that time and dull as he was at all others he was not without the instinctive penetration with which all human bipeds watch over their individual goods and chattels he sprung aside from the endearments of the syren grasped her arm and in a voice of querulous indignation accused her of the theft then rose the cry of womenshrill as shriek of gosshawk on the hill never were my ears so stunned the angry authors in the adventures of gil blas were nothing to the disputants in the kennel at charing cross we rowed swore slanged with a christian meekness and forbearance which would have rejoiced mr wilberforce to the heart and we were already preparing ourselves for a more striking engagement when we were most unwelcomely interrupted by the presence of three watchmen take away thisthisdd woman hiccuped out staunton she has stolenhiccupmy watchhiccup no such thing watchman hallooed out the accused the bcounterskipper never had any watch he only filched a twopennyhalfpenny gilt chain out of his master levi the pawnbrokers window and stuck it in his eelskin to make a show ye did ye pitiful lankychopped son of a dogfish ye did come come said the watchman move on move on you be dd for a charley said one of our gang ho ho master jackanapes i shall give you a cooling in the watchhouse if you tips us any of your jaw i dare say the young oman here is quite right about ye and ye never had any watch at all at all you are a dd liar cried staunton and you are all in with each other like a pack of rogues as you are ill tell ye what young gemman said another watchman who was a more potent grave and reverend senior than his comrades if you do not move on instantly and let those decent young omen alone ill take you all up before sir richard charley my boy said dartmore did you ever get thrashed for impertinence the last mentioned watchman took upon himself the reply to this interrogatory by a very summary proceeding he collared dartmore and his companions did the same kind office to us this action was not committed with impunity in an instant two of the moons minions staffs lanterns and all were measuring their length at the foot of their namesake of royal memory the remaining dogberry was however a tougher assailant he held staunton so firmly in his gripe that the poor youth could scarcely breathe out a faint and feeble dye of defiance and with his disengaged hand he made such an admirable use of his rattle that we were surrounded in a trice as when an anthill is invaded from every quarter and crevice of the mound arise and pour out an angry host of whose previous existence the unwary assailant had not dreamt so from every lane and alley and street and crossing came fast and far the champions of the night gentlemen said dartmore we must flysauve qui peut we wanted no stronger admonition and accordingly all of us who were able set off with the utmost velocity with which god had gifted us i have some faint recollection that i myself headed the flight i remember well that i dashed up the strand and dashed down a singular little shed from which emanated the steam of tea and a sharp querulous scream of all hotall hot a penny a pint i see now by the dim light of retrospection a vision of an old woman in the kennel and a pewter pot of mysterious ingredients precipitated into a greengrocers shop te virides inter lauros as vincent would have said on we went faster and faster as the rattle rung in our ears and the tramp of the enemy echoed after us in hot pursuit the devil take the hindmost said dartmore breathlessly as he kept up with me the watchman has saved his majesty the trouble answered i looking back and seeing one of our friends in the clutch of the pursuers on on was dartmores only reply at last after innumerable perils and various immersements into back passages and courts and alleys which like the chicaneries of law preserved and befriended us in spite of all the efforts of justice we fairly found ourselves in safety in the midst of a great square here we paused and after ascertaining our individual safeties we looked round to ascertain the sum total of the general loss alas we were wofully fully shorn of our beamswe were reduced onehalf only three out of the six survived the conflict and the flight half said the companion of dartmore and myself whose name was tringle and who was a dabbler in science of which he was not a little vain half is less worthy than the whole but the half is more worthy than nonentity an axiom said i not to be disputed but now that we are safe and have time to think </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> think about it are you not slightly of opinion that we behaved somewhat scurvily to our better half in leaving it so quietly in the hands of the philistines by no means answered dartmore in a party whose members make no pretensions to sobriety it would be too hard to expect that persons who are scarcely capable of taking care of themselves should take care of other people no we have in all these exploits only the one maxim of selfpreservation allow me said tringle seizing me by the coat to explain it to you on scientific principles you will find in hydrostatics that the attraction of cohesion is far less powerful in fluids than in solids viz that persons who have been converting their solid flesh into wine skins cannot stick so close to one another as when they are sober bravo tringle cried dartmore and now pelham i hope your delicate scruples are after so luminous an eclaircissement set at rest for ever you have convinced me said i let us leave the unfortunates to their fate and sir richard what is now to be done why in the first place answered dartmore let us reconnoitre does any one know this spot not i said both of us we inquired of an old fellow who was tottering home under the same bacchanalian auspices as ourselves and found we were in lincolns inn fields which shall we do asked i stroll home or parade the streets visit the cidercellar and the finish and kiss the first lass we meet in the morning bringing her charms and carrots to covent garden market the latter cried dartmore and tringle without doubt come then said i let us investigate holborn and dip into st giless and then find our way into some more known corner of the globe amen said dartmore and accordingly we renewed our march we wound along a narrow lane tolerably well known i imagine to the gentlemen of the quill and entered holborn there was a beautiful still moon above us which cast its light over a drowsy stand of hackney coaches and shed a silver sadness over the thin visages and sombre vestments of two guardians of the night who regarded us we thought with a very ominous aspect of suspicion we strolled along leisurely enough till we were interrupted by a miserablelooking crowd assembled round a dull dingy melancholy shop from which gleamed a solitary candle whose long spinsterlike wick was flirting away with an east wind at a most unconscionable rate upon the haggard and worn countenances of the bystanders was depicted one general and sympathizing expression of eager envious wistful anxiety which predominated so far over the various characters of each as to communicate something of a likeness to all it was an impress of such a seal as you might imagine not the archfiend but one of his subordinate shepherds would have set upon each of his flock amid this crowd i recognized more than one face which i had often seen in my equestrian lounges through town peering from the shoulders of some intrusive ragamuffin wagesless lackey and squealing out of its wretched unpampered mouth the everlasting query of want your oss held sir the rest were made up of unfortunate women of the vilest and most ragged description aged itinerants with features seared with famine bleared eyes dropping jaws shivering limbs and all the mortal signs of hopeless and aidless and worst of all breadless infirmity here and there an irish accent broke out in the oaths of national impatience and was answered by the shrill broken voice of some decrepit but indefatigable votaress of pleasurepleasure good god but the chief character of the meeting was silencesilence eager heavy engrossing and above them all shone out the quiet moon so calm so holy so breathing of still happiness and unpolluted glory as if it never looked upon the traces of human passion and misery and sin we stood for some moments contemplating the group before us and then following the steps of an old withered crone who with a cracked cup in her hand was pushing her way through the throng we found ourselves in that dreary pandaemonium at once the origin and the refuge of humble vicesa ginshop poor devils said dartmore to two or three of the nearest and eagerest among the crowd come in and i will treat you the invitation was received with a promptness which must have been the most gratifying compliment to the inviter and thus want which is the mother of invention does not object now and then to a bantling by politeness we stood by the counter while our proteges were served in silent observation in low vice to me there is always something too gloomy almost too fearful for light mirth the contortions of the madman are stranger than those of the fool but one does not laugh at them the sympathy is for the causenot the effect leaning against the counter at one corner and fixing his eyes deliberately and unmovingly upon us was a man about the age of fifty dressed in a costume of singular fashion apparently pretending to an antiquity of taste correspondent with that of the material this person wore a large cockedhat set rather jauntily on one sidea black coat which seemed an omnium gatherum of all abominations that had come in its way for the last ten years and which appeared to advance equal claims from the manner it was made and worn to the several dignities of the art military and civil the arma and the togafrom the neck of the wearer hung a blue ribbon of amazing breadth and of a very surprising assumption of newness and splendour by no means in harmony with the other parts of the tout ensemble this was the guardian of an eyeglass of block tin and of dimensions correspondent with the size of the ribbon stuck under the right arm and shaped fearfully like a sword peeped out the hilt of a very large and sturdy looking stick in war a weapon in peace a support the features of the man were in keeping with his garb they betokened an equal mixture of the traces of poverty and the assumption of the dignities reminiscent of a better day two small lightblue eyes were shaded by bushy and rather imperious brows which lowered from under the hat like cerberus out of his den these at present wore the dull fixed stare of habitual intoxication though we were not long in discovering that they had not yet forgotten to sparkle with all the quickness and more than the roguery of youth his nose was large prominent and aristocratic nor would it have been ill formed had not some unknown cause pushed it a little nearer towards the left ear than would have been thought by an equitable judge of beauty fair to the pretensions of the right the lines in the countenance were marked as if in iron and had the face been perfectly composed must have given to it a remarkably stern and sinister appearance but at that moment there was an arch leer about the mouth which softened or at least altered the expression the features habitually wore sir said he after a few minutes of silence sir said he approaching me will you do me the honour to take a pinch of snuff and so saying he tapped a curious copper box with a picture of his late majesty upon it with great pleasure answered i bowing low since the act is a prelude to the pleasure of your acquaintance my gentleman of the ginshop opened his box with an air as he repliedit is but seldom that i meet in places of this description gentlemen of the exterior of yourself and your friends i am not a person very easily deceived by the outward man horace sir could not have included me when he said specie decipimur i perceive that you are surprised at hearing me quote latin alas sir in my wandering and various manner of life i may say with cicero and pliny that the study of letters has proved my greatest consolation gaudium mihi says the latter author et solatium in literis nihil tam laete quod his non laetius nihil tam triste quid non per hos sit minus triste god dn ye you scoundrel give me my gin arnt you ashamed of keeping a gentleman of my fashion so long waiting this was said to the sleepy dispenser of the spirituous potations who looked up for a moment with a dull stare and then replied your money first mr gordonyou owe us sevenpence halfpenny already blood and confusion speakest thou to me of halfpence know that thou art a mercenary varlet yes knave mark that a mercenary varlet the sleepy ganymede replied not and the wrath of mr gordon subsided into a low interrupted internal muttering of strange oaths which rolled and grumbled and rattled in his throat like distant thunder at length he cheered up a littlesir said he addressing dartmore it is a sad thing to be dependant on these low persons the wise among the ancients were never so wrong as when they panegyrized poverty it is the wicked mans tempter the good mans perdition the proud mans curse the melancholy mans halter you are a strange old cock said the unsophisticated dartmore eyeing him from head to foot theres half a sovereign for you the blunt blue eyes of mr gordon sharpened up in an instant he seized the treasure with an avidity of which the minute after he seemed somewhat ashamed for he said playing with the coin in an idle indifferent mannersir you show a consideration and let me add sir a delicacy of feeling unusual at your years sir i shall repay you at my earliest leisure and in the meanwhile allow me to say that i shall be proud of the honour of your acquaintance thankye old boy said dartmore putting on his glove before he accepted the offered hand of his new friend which though it was tendered with great grace and dignity was of a marvellously dingy and soapless aspect harkye you dd son of a gun </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> gun cried mr

<chapter>chapter l the history of a philosophical vagabond pursuing novelty and losing contentvicar of wakefield we followed our strange friend through the crowd at the door which he elbowed on either side with the most aristocratic disdain perfectly regardless of their jokes at his dress and manner he no sooner got through the throng than he stopped short though in the midst of the kennel and offered us his arm this was an honour of which we were by no means desirous for to say nothing of the shabbiness of mr gordons exterior there was a certain odour in his garments which was possibly less displeasing to the wearer than to his acquaintance accordingly we pretended not to notice this invitation and merely said we would follow his guidance he turned up a narrow street and after passing some of the most ill favoured alleys i ever had the happiness of beholding he stopped at a low door here he knocked twice and was at last admitted by a slipshod yawning wench with red arms and a profusion of sandy hair this hebe mr gordon greeted with a loving kiss which the kissee resented in a very unequivocal strain of disgustful reproach hush my queen of clubs my sultana sootina said mr gordon hush or these gentlemen will think you in earnest i have brought three new customers to the club this speech somewhat softened the incensed houri of mr gordons paradise and she very civilly asked us to enter stop said mr gordon with an air of importance i must just step in and ask the gentlemen to admit youmerely a formfor a word from me will be quite sufficient and so saying he vanished for about five minutes on his return he said with a cheerful countenance that we were free of the house but that we must pay a shilling each as the customary fee this sum was soon collected and quietly inserted in the waistcoat pocket of our chaperon who then conducted us up the passage into a small back room where were sitting about seven or eight men enveloped in smoke and moistening the fever of the virginian plant with various preparations of malt on entering i observed mr gordon deposit at a sort of bar the sum of threepence by which i shrewdly surmised he had gained the sum of two and ninepence by our admission with a very arrogant air he proceeded to the head of the table sat himself down with a swagger and called out like a lusty royster of the true kidney for a pint of purl and a pipe not to be out of fashion we ordered the same articles of luxury after we had all commenced a couple of puffs at our pipes i looked round at our fellow guests they seemed in a very poor state of body as might naturally be supposed and in order to ascertain how far the condition of the mind was suited to that of the frame i turned round to mr gordon and asked him in a whisper to give us a few hints as to the genus and characteristics of the individual components of his club mr gordon declared himself delighted with the proposal and we all adjourned to a separate table at the corner of the room where mr gordon after a deep draught at the purl thus beganyou observe yon thin meagre cadaverous animal with rather an intelligent and melancholy expression of countenancehis name is chitterling crabtree his father was an eminent coalmerchant and left him l10000 crabtree turned politician when fate wishes to ruin a man of moderate abilities and moderate fortune she makes him an

his liberty and marriedhis wife loved a community of goods no less than her spouse and ran off with one citizen while he was running on to the others chitterling dried his tears and contented himself with the reflection that in a proper state of things such an event could not have occurred mr crabtrees money and life were now half gone one does not subscribe to the friends of freedom and spout at their dinners for nothing but the worst drop was yet in the cup an undertaking of the most spirited and promising nature was conceived by the chief of the friends and the dearest familiar of mr chitterling crabtree our worthy embarked his fortune in a speculation so certain of successcrash went the speculation and off went the friendmr crabtree was ruined he was not however a man to despair at trifles what were bread meat and beer to the champion of equality he went to the meeting that very night he said he gloried in his lossesthey were for the cause the whole conclave rang with shouts of applause and mr chitterling crabtree went to bed happier than ever i need not pursue his history farther you see him hereverbum sat he spouts at the ciceronian for half a crown a night and to this day subscribes sixpence a week to the cause of liberty and enlightenment all over the world by heaven cried dartmore he is a fine fellow and my father shall do something for him gordon pricked up his ears and continuednow for the second person gentlemen whom i am about to describe to you you see that middlesized stout man with a slight squint and a restless lowering cunning expression what him in the kerseymere breeches and green jacket said i the same answered gordon his real name when he does not travel with an alias is job jonson he is one of the most remarkable rogues in christendom he is so noted a cheat that there is not a pickpocket in england who would keep company with him if he had anything to lose he was the favourite of his father who intended to leave him all his fortune which was tolerably large he robbed him one day on the high road his father discovered it and disinherited him he was placed at a merchants office and rose step by step to be head clerk and intended soninlaw three nights before his marriage he broke open the till and was turned out of doors the next morning if you were going to do him the greatest favour in the world he could not keep his hands out of your pocket till you had done it in short he has rogued himself out of a dozen fortunes and a hundred friends and managed with incredible dexterity and success to cheat himself into beggary and a pot of beer i beg your pardon said i but i think a sketch of your own life must be more amusing than that of any one else am i impertinent in asking for it not at all replied mr gordon you shall have it in as few words as possible i was born a gentleman and educated with some pains they told me i was a genius and it was not very hard to persuade me of the truth of the assertion i wrote verses to a wonderrobbed orchards according to military tacticsnever played at marbles without explaining to my competitors the theory of attractionand was the best informed mischievous little rascal in the whole school my family were in great doubt what to do with so prodigious a wonder one said the law another the church a third talked of diplomacy and a fourth assured my mother that if i could but be introduced at court i should be lord chamberlain in a twelvemonth while my friends were deliberating i took the liberty of deciding i enlisted in a fit of loyal valour in a marching regiment my friends made the best of a bad job and bought me an ensigncy i recollect i read plato the night before i went to battle the next morning they told me i ran away i am sure it was a malicious invention for if i had i should have recollected it whereas i was in such a confusion that i cannot remember a single thing that happened in the whole course of that day about six months afterwards i found myself out of the army and in gaol and no sooner had my relations released me from the latter predicament than i set off on my travels at dublin i lost my heart to a rich widow as i thought i married her and found her as poor as myself god knows what would have become of me if i </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> i had not taken to drinking my wife scorned to be outdone by me in any thing she followed my example and at the end of a year i followed her to the grave since then i have taken warning and been scrupulously soberbetty my love another pint of purl i was now once more a freeman in the prime of my life handsome as you see gentlemen and with the strength and spirit of a young hercules accordingly i dried my tears turned marker by night at a gambling house and buck by day in bondstreet for i had returned to london i remember well one morning that his present majesty was pleased en passant to admire my buckskinstempora mutantur well gentlemen one night at a brawl in our salon my nose met with a rude hint to move to the right i went in a great panic to the surgeon who mended the matter by moving it to the left there thank god it has rested in quiet ever since it is needless to tell you the nature of the quarrel in which this accident occurred however my friends thought it necessary to remove me from the situation i then held i went once more to ireland and was introduced to a friend of freedom i was poor that circumstance is quite enough to make a patriot they sent me to paris on a secret mission and when i returned my friends were in prison being always of a free disposition i did not envy them their situation accordingly i returned to england halting at liverpool with a most debilitated purse i went into a silversmiths shop to brace it and about six months afterwards i found myself on a marine excursion to botany bay on my return from that country i resolved to turn my literary talents to account i went to cambridge wrote declamations and translated virgil at so much a sheet my relations thanks to my letters neither few nor far between soon found me out they allowed me they do so still half a guinea a week and upon this and my declamations i manage to exist

<chapter>chapter li i hate a drunken roguetwelfth night we took an affectionate leave of mr gordon and found ourselves once more in the open air the smoke and the purl had contributed greatly to the continuance of our inebriety and we were as much averse to bed as ever we conveyed ourselves laughing and rioting all the way to a stand of hackneycoaches we entered the head of the flock and drove to piccadilly it set us down at the corner of the haymarket past two cried the watchman as we sauntered by him you lie you rascal said i you have passed three now we were all merry enough to laugh at this sally and seeing a light gleam from the entrance of the royal saloon we knocked at the door and it was opened unto us we sat down at the only spare table in the place and looked round at the smug and varment citizens with whom the room was filled hollo waiter cried tringle some red wine negusi know not why it is but the devil himself could never cure me of thirst wine and i have a most chemical attraction for each other you know that we always estimate the force of attraction between bodies by the force required to separate them while we were all three as noisy and nonsensical as our best friends could have wished us a new stranger entered approached looked round the room for a seat and seeing none walked leisurely up to our table and accosted me with aha mr pelham how dye do well met by your leave i will sip my grog at your table no offence i hopemore the merrier ehwaiter a glass of hot brandy and waternot too weak dye hear need i say that this pithy and pretty address proceeded from the mouth of mr tom thornton he was somewhat more than half drunk and his light prying eyes twinkled dizzily in his head dartmore who was and is the best natured fellow alive hailed the signs of his intoxication as a sort of freemasonry and made way for him beside himself i could not help remarking that thornton seemed singularly less sleek than heretofore his coat was out at the elbows his linen was torn and soiled there was not a vestige of the vulgar spruceness about him which was formerly one of his most prominent characteristics he had also lost a great deal of the florid health formerly visible in his face his cheeks seemed sunk and haggard his eyes hollow and his complexion sallow and squalid in spite of the flush which intemperance spread over it at the moment however he was in high spirits and soon made himself so entertaining that dartmore and tringle grew charmed with him as for me the antipathy i had to the man sobered and silenced me for the rest of the night and finding that dartmore and his friend were eager for an introduction to some female friends of thorntons whom he mentioned in terms of high praise i tore myself from them and made the best of my way home </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lii illi mors gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritus sibi seneca nous serons par nos lois les juges des ouvragesles femmes savantes vincent called on me the next day i have news for you said he though somewhat of a lugubrious nature lugete veneres cupidinesque you remember the duchesse de perpignan i should think so was my answer well then pursued vincent she is no more her death was worthy of her life she was to give a brilliant entertainment to all the foreigners at paris the day before it took place a dreadful eruption broke over her complexion she sent for the doctors in despair cure me against tomorrow she said and name your own reward madame it is impossible to do so with safety to your health au diable with your health said the duchesse what is health to an eruption the doctors took the hint an external application was usedthe duchesse woke in the morning as beautiful as everthe entertainment took placeshe was the armida of the scene supper was announced she took the arm of theambassador and moved through the crowd amidst the audible admiration of all she stopped for a moment at the door all eyes were upon her a fearful and ghastly convulsion passed over her countenance her lips trembled she fell on the ground with the most terrible contortions of face and frame they carried her to bed she remained for some days insensible when she recovered she asked for a lookingglass her whole face was drawn on one side not a wreck of beauty was leftthat night she poisoned herself i cannot express how shocked i was at this information much as i had cause to be disgusted with the conduct of that unhappy woman i could find in my mind no feeling but commiseration and horror at her death and it was with great difficulty that vincent persuaded me to accept an invitation to lady rosevilles for the evening to meet glanville and himself however i cheered up as the night came on and though my mind was still haunted with the tale of the morning it was neither in a musing nor a melancholy mood that i entered the drawingroom at lady rosevillesso runs the world away glanville was there in his customary mourning and looking remarkably handsome pelham he said when he joined me do you remember at ladys one night i said i would introduce you to my sister i had no opportunity then for we left the house before she returned from the refreshment room may i do so now i need not say what was my answer i followed glanville into the next room and to my inexpressible astonishment and delight discovered in his sister the beautiful the neverforgotten stranger i had seen at cheltenham for once in my life i was embarrassedmy bow would have shamed a major in the line and my stuttered and irrelevant address an alderman in the presence of his majesty however a few moments sufficed to recover me and i strained every nerve to be as agreeable and seduisant as possible after i had conversed with miss glanville for some time lady roseville joined us stately and junolike as was that charming personage in general she relaxed into a softness of manner to miss glanville that quite won my heart she drew her to a part of the room where a very animated and chiefly literary conversation was going onand i resolving to make the best of my time followed them and once more found myself seated beside miss glanville lady roseville was on the other side of my beautiful companion and i observed that whenever she took her eyes from miss glanville they always rested upon her brother who in the midst of the disputation and the disputants sat silent gloomy and absorbed the conversation turned upon scotts novels thence on novels in general and finally on the particular one of anastasius it is a thousand pities said vincent that the scene of that novel is so far removed from us could the humour the persons the knowledge of character and of the world come home to us in a national not an exotic garb it would be a more popular as it is certainly a more gifted work than even the exquisite novel of gil blas but it is a great misfortune </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> misfortune for hope that to learning he narrowed his mind and gave up to the east what was meant for mankind one often loses in admiration at the knowledge of peculiar costume the deference one would have paid to the masterly grasp of universal character it must require said lady roseville an extraordinary combination of mental powers to produce a perfect novel one so extraordinary answered vincent that though we have one perfect epic poem and several which pretend to perfection we have not one perfect novel in the world gil blas approaches more to perfection than any other owing to the defect i have just mentioned in anastasius but it must be confessed that there is a want of dignity of moral rectitude and of what i may term moral beauty throughout the whole book if an author could combine the various excellencies of scott and le sage with a greater and more metaphysical knowledge of morals than either we might expect from him the perfection we have not yet discovered since the days of apuleius speaking of morals said lady roseville do you not think every novel should have its distinct but and inculcate throughout some one peculiar moral such as many of marmontels and miss edgeworths no answered vincent every good novel has one great endthe same in allviz the increasing our knowledge of the heart it is thus that a novel writer must be a philosopher whoever succeeds in shewing us more accurately the nature of ourselves and species has done science and consequently virtue the most important benefit for every truth is a moral this great and universal end i am led to imagine is rather crippled than extended by the rigorous attention to the one isolated moral you mention thus dryden in his essay on the progress of satire very rightly prefers horace to juvenal so far as instruction is concerned because the miscellaneous satires of the former are directed against every vicethe more confined ones of the latter for the most part only against one all mankind is the field the novelist should cultivateall truth the moral he should strive to bring home it is in occasional dialogue in desultory maxims in deductions from events in analysis of character that he should benefit and instruct it is not enoughand i wish a certain novelist who has lately arisen would remember thisit is not enough for a writer to have a good heart amiable sympathies and what are termed high feelings in order to shape out a moral either true in itself or beneficial in its inculcation before he touches his tale he should be thoroughly acquainted with the intricate science of morals and the metaphysical as well as the more open operations of the mind if his knowledge is not deep and clear his love of the good may only lead him into error and he may pass off the prejudices of a susceptible heart for the precepts of virtue would to god that people would think it necessary to be instructed before they attempt to instruct dire simplement que la vertu est vertu parce quelle est bonne en son fonds et le vice tout au contraire ce nest pas les faire connoitre for me if i was to write a novel i would first make myself an acute active and vigilant observer of men and manners secondly i would after having thus noted effects by action in the world trace the causes by books and meditation in my closet it is then and not till then that i would study the lighter graces of style and decoration nor would i give the rein to invention till i was convinced that it would create neither monsters of men nor falsities of truth for my vehicles of instruction or amusement i would have people as they areneither worse nor betterand the moral they should convey should be rather through jest or irony than gravity and seriousness there never was an imperfection corrected by portraying perfection and if levity or ridicule be said so easily to allure to sin i do not see why they should not be used in defence of virtue of this we may be sure that as laughter is a distinct indication of the human race so there never was a brute mind or a savage heart that loved to indulge in it note the philosopher of malmesbury express a very different opinion of the origin of laughter and for my part i think his doctrine in great measure though not altogethertruesee hobbes on human nature and the answer to him in campbells rhetoric vincent ceased thank you my lord said lady roseville as she took miss glanvilles arm and moved from the table for once you have condescended to give us your own sense and not other peoples you have scarce made a single quotation accept answered vincent rising accept a miracle instead of wit </chapter>

<chapter>chapter liii oh i lovemethinks this word of love is fit for all the world and that for gentle hearts another name should speak of gentler thoughts than the world ownsp b shelley for me i ask no more than honour gives to think me yours and rank me with your friendsshakspeare callous and worldly as i may seem from the tone of these memoirs i can say safely that one of the most delicious evenings i ever spent was the first of my introduction to miss glanville i went home intoxicated with a subtle spirit of enjoyment that gave a new zest and freshness to life two little hours seemed to have changed the whole course of my thoughts and feelings there was nothing about miss glanville like a heroinei hate your heroines she had none of that modest ease and quiet dignity and english grace lord help us of which certain writers speak with such applause thank heaven she was alive she had great sense but the playfulness of a child extreme rectitude of mind but with the tenderness of a gazelle if she laughed all her countenance lips eyes forehead cheeks laughed too paradise seemed opened in her face if she looked grave it was such a lofty and upward yet sweet and gentle gravity that you might had you been gifted with the least imagination have supposed from the model of her countenance a new order of angels between the cherubim and the seraphim the angels of love and wisdom she was not perhaps quite so silent in society as my individual taste would desire but when she spoke it was with a propriety of thought and diction which made me lament when her voice had ceased it was as if something beautiful in creation had stopped suddenly enough of this now i was lazily turning the morning after lady rosevilles over some old books when vincent entered i observed that his face was flushed and his eyes sparkled with more than their usual brilliancy he looked carefully round the room and then approaching his chair towards mine said in a low tonepelham i have something of importance on my mind which i wish to discuss with you but let me entreat you to lay aside your usual levity and pardon me if i say affectation meet me with the candour and plainness which are the real distinctions of your character my lord vincent i replied there is in your words a depth and solemnity which pierce me through one of ns best stuffed coats even to the very heart let me ring for my poodle and some eau de cologne and i will hear you as you desire from the alpha to the omega of your discourse vincent bit his lip but i rung had my orders executed and then settling myself and my poodle on the sofa i declared my readiness to attend to him my dear friend said he i have often seen that in spite of all your love of pleasure you have your mind continually turned towards higher and graver objects and i have thought the better of your talents and of your future success for the little parade you make of the one and the little care you appear to pay to the other for tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder i have also observed that you have of late been much to lord dawtons i have even heard that you have been twice closeted with him it is well known that that person entertains hopes of leading the opposition to the grata arva of the treasury benches and notwithstanding the years in which the whigs have been out of office there are some persons who pretend to foresee the chance of a coalition between them and mr gaskell to whose principles it is also added that they have been gradually assimilating here vincent paused a moment and looked full at me i met his eye with a glance as searching as his own his look changed and he continued now listen to me pelham such a coalition never can take place you smile i repeat it it is my object to form a third party perhaps while the two great sects anticipate the cabinet designs of fate there may suddenly come by a third to whom the whole shall be referred say that you think it not impossible that you may join us and i will tell you more i paused for three minutes before i answered vincent i then saidi thank you very sincerely for your proposal tell me the names of two of your designed party and i will answer you lord lincoln and lord lesborough what said ithe whig who says in the upper house that whatever may be the distresses of the people they shall not be gratified at the cost of one of the despotic privileges of the aristocracy go toi will have none of him as to lesborough he is a fool and a boasterwho is always puffing his own vanity with the windiest pair of oratorical bellows that ever were made by air and brass for the purpose of sound and smoke signifying nothing go toi will have none of him either you are right in your judgment of my confreres answered vincent but we must make use </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> use of bad tools for good purposes nono said i the commonest carpenter will tell you the reverse vincent eyed me suspiciously look you said he i know well that no man loves better than you place power and reputation do you grant this i do was my reply join with us i will place you in the house of commons immediately if we succeed you shall have the first and the best post i can give you nowunder which king bezonian speak or die i answer you in the words of the same worthy you quote said ia foutra for thine officedo you know vincent that i have strange as it may seem to you such a thing as a conscience it is true i forget it now and then but in a public capacity the recollection of others would put me very soon in mind of it i know your party well i cannot imagineforgive meone more injurious to the country nor one more revolting to myself and i do positively affirm that i would sooner feed my poodle on paunch and liver instead of cream and fricassee than be an instrument in the hands of men like lincoln and lesborough who talk much who perform nothingwho join ignorance of every principle of legislation to indifference for every benefit to the peoplewho are full of wise saws but empty of modern instanceswho level upwards and trample downwardsand would only value the ability you are pleased to impute to me in the exact proportion that a sportsman values the ferret that burrows for his pleasure and destroys for his interest your party shant stand vincent turned paleand how long said he have you learnt the principles of legislation and this mighty affection for the benefit of the people ever since said i coldly i learnt any thing the first piece of real knowledge i ever gained was that my interest was incorporated with that of the beings with whom i had the chance of being cast if i injure them i injure myself if i can do them any good i receive the benefit in common with the rest now as i have a great love for that personage who has now the honour of addressing you i resolved to be honest for his sake so much for my affection for the benefit of the people as to the little knowledge of the principles of legislation on which you are kind enough to compliment me look over the books on this table or the writings in this desk and know that ever since i had the misfortune of parting from you at cheltenham there has not been a day in which i have spent less than six hours reading and writing on that sole subject but enough of thiswill you ride today vincent rose slowly gli arditi said he tuoi voti gia noti mi sono ma inveno a quel trono tu aspiri con me trema per te io trema i replied out of the same operaio tremadi te well answered vincent and his fine high nature overcame his momentary resentment and chagrin at my reception of his offerwell i honour your for your sentiments though they are opposed to my own i may depend on your secrecy you may said i i forgive you pelham rejoined vincent we part friends wait one moment said i and pardon me if i venture to speak in the language of caution to one in every way so superior to myself no one i say this with a safe conscience for i never flattered my friend in my life though i have often adulated my enemyno one has a greater admiration for your talents than myself i desire eagerly to see you in the station most fit for their display pause one moment before you link yourself not only to a party but to principles that cannot stand you have only to exert yourself and you may either lead the opposition or be among the foremost in the administration take something certain rather than what is doubtful or at least stand alonesuch is my belief in your powers if fairly tried that if you were not united to those men i would promise you faithfully to stand or fall by you alone even if we had not through all england another soldier to our standard but i thank you pelham said vincent interrupting me till we meet in public as enemies we are friends in privatei desire no morefarewell </chapter>

<chapter>chapter liv il vaut mieux employer notre esprit a supporter les infortunes qui nous arrivent qua prevoir celle qui nous peuvent arriverrochefoucault no sooner had vincent departed than i buttoned my coat and sallied out through a cold easterly wind to lord dawtons it was truly said by the political quoter that i had been often to that noblemans although i have not thought it advisable to speak of my political adventures hitherto i have before said that i was ambitious and the sagacious have probably already discovered that i was somewhat less ignorant than it was my usual pride and pleasure to appear heaven knows why but i had established among my uncles friends a reputation for talent which i by no means deserved and no sooner had i been personally introduced to lord dawton than i found myself courted by that personage in a manner equally gratifying and uncommon when i lost my seat in parliament dawton assured me that before the session was over i should be returned for one of his boroughs and though my mind revolted at the idea of becoming dependant on any party i made little scruple of promising conditionally to ally myself to his so far had affairs gone when i was honoured with vincents proposal i found lord dawton in his library with the marquess of clandonald lord dartmores father and from his rank and property classed among the highest as from his vanity and restlessness he was among the most active members of the opposition clandonald left the room when i entered few men in office are wise enough to trust the young as if the greater zeal and sincerity of youth did not more than compensate for its appetite for the gay or its thoughtlessness of the serious when we were alone dawton said to me we are in great despair at the motion upon the to be made in the lower house we have not a single person whom we can depend upon for the sweeping and convincing answer we ought to make and though we should at least muster our full force in voting our whipperin poor is so ill that i fear we shall make but a very pitiful figure give me said i full permission to go forth into the highways and byways and i will engage to bring a whole legion of dandies to the house door i can go no farther your other agents must do the rest thank you my dear young friend said lord dawton eagerly thank you a thousand times we must really get you in the house as soon as possible you will serve us more than i can express i bowed with a sneer i could not repress dawton pretended not to observe it come said i my lord we have no time to lose i shall meet you perhaps at brookess to morrow evening and report to you respecting my success lord dawton pressed my hand warmly and followed me to the door he is the best premier we could have thought i but he deceives himself if he thinks henry pelham will play the jackall to his lion he will soon see that i shall keep for myself what he thinks i hunt for him i passed through pall mall and thought of glanville i knocked at his door he was at home i found him leaning his cheek upon his hand in a thoughtful position an open letter was before him read that he said pointing to it i did so it was from the agent to the duke of and contained his appointment to an opposition borough a new toy pelham said he faintly smiling but a little longer and they will all be brokenthe rattle will be the last my dear dear glanville said i much affected do not talk thus you have every thing before you yes interrupted glanville you are right for every thing left for me is in the grave do you imagine that i can taste one of the possessions which fortune has heaped upon me that i have one healthful faculty one sense of enjoyment among the hundred which other men are heirs to when did you ever see me for a moment happy i live as it were on a rock barren and herbless and sapless and cut off from all human fellowship and intercourse i had only a single object left to live for when you saw me at paris i have gratified that and the end and purpose of my existence is fulfilled heaven is merciful but a little while and this feverish and unquiet spirit shall be at rest i took his hand and pressed it feel said he this dry burning skin count my pulse through the variations of a single minute and you will cease either to pity me or to speak to me of life for months i have had night and day a wastingwasting fever of brain and heart and frame the fire works well and the fuel is nearly consumed he paused and we were both silent in fact i was shocked at the fever of his pulse no less than affected at the despondency of his words at last i spoke to him of medical advice canst thou he said with a deep solemnity of voice and manner administer to a mind diseasedpluck from the memoryah away with the quotation and the reflection and he sprung from the sofa and going to the window opened it and leaned out for a few moments in silence when he turned again towards me his manner had regained its usual quiet he spoke about the important motion approaching on the and promised to attend and then by degrees i led </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> led him to talk of his sister he mentioned her with enthusiasm beautiful as ellen is he said her face is the very faintest reflection of her mind her habits of thought are so pure that every impulse is a virtue never was there a person to whom goodness was so easy vice seems something so opposite to her nature that i cannot imagine it possible for her to sin will you not call with me at your mothers said i i am going there today glanville replied in the affirmative and we went at once to lady glanvilles in berkeleysquare we were admitted into his mothers boudoir she was alone with miss glanville our conversation soon turned from commonplace topics to those of a graver nature the deep melancholy of glanvilles mind imbued all his thoughts when he once suffered himself to express them why said lady glanville who seemed painfully fond of her son why do you not go more into the world you suffer your mind to prey upon itself till it destroys you my dear dear son how very ill you seem ellen whose eyes swam in tears as they gazed upon her brother laid her beautiful hand upon his and said for my mothers sake reginald do take more care of yourself you want air and exercise and amusement no answered glanville i want nothing but occupation and thanks to the duke of i have now got it i am chosen member for i am too happy said the proud mother you will now be all i have ever predicted for you and in her joy at the moment she forgot the hectic of his cheek and the hollowness of his eye do you remember said reginald turning to his sister those beautiful lines in my favourite ford glories of human greatness are but pleasing dreams and shadows soon decaying on the stage of my mortality my youth has acted some scenes of vanity drawn out at length by varied pleasuressweetened in the mixture but tragical in issue beauty pomp with every sensuality our giddiness doth frame an idolare inconstant friends when any troubled passion makes us halt on the unguarded castle of the mind your verses said i are beautiful even to me who have no soul for poetry and never wrote a line in my life but i love not their philosophy in all sentiments that are impregnated with melancholy and instil sadness as a moral i question the wisdom and dispute the truth there is no situation in life which we cannot sweeten or embitter at will if the past is gloomy i do not see the necessity of dwelling upon it if the mind can make one vigorous exertion it can another the same energy you put forth in acquiring knowledge would also enable you to baffle misfortune determine not to think upon what is painful resolutely turn away from every thing that recals it bend all your attention to some new and engrossing object do this and you defeat the past you smile as if this were impossible yet it is not an iota more so than to tear ones self from a favourite pursuit and addict ones self to an object unwelcome to one at first this the mind does continually through life so can it also do the other if you will but make an equal exertion nor does it seem to me natural to the human heart to look much to the past all its plans its projects its aspirations are for the future it is for the future and in the future that we live our very passions when most agitated are most anticipative revenge avarice ambition love the desire of good and evil are all fixed and pointed to some distant goal to look backwards is like walking backwardsagainst our proper formation the mind does not readily adopt the habit and when once adopted it will readily return to its natural bias oblivion is therefore an easier obtained boon than we imagine forgetfulness of the past is purchased by increasing our anxiety for the future i paused for a moment but glanville did not answer me and encouraged by a look from ellen i continuedyou remember that according to an old creed if we were given memory as a curse we were also given hope as a blessing counteract the one by the other in my own life i have committed many weak many wicked actions i have chased away their remembrance though i have transplanted their warning to the future as the body involuntarily avoids what is hurtful to it without tracing the association to its first experience so the mind insensibly shuns what has formerly afflicted it even without palpably recalling the remembrance of the affliction the roman philosopher placed the secret of human happiness in the one maximnot to admire i never could exactly comprehend the sense of the moral my maxim for the same object would benever to regret alas my dear friend said glanvillewe are great philosophers to each other but not to ourselves the moment we begin to feel sorrow we cease to reflect on its wisdom time is the only comforter your maxims are very true but they confirm me in my opinionthat it is in vain for us to lay down fixed precepts for the regulation of the mind so long as it is dependent upon the body happiness and its reverse are constitutional in many persons and it is then only that they are independent of circumstances make the health the frames of all men alikemake their nerves of the same susceptibilitytheir memories of the same bluntness or acutenessand i will then allow that you can give rules adapted to all men till then your maxim never to regret is as idle as horaces never to admire it may be wise to youit is impossible to me with these last words glanvilles voice faltered and i felt averse to push the argument further ellens eye caught mine and gave me a look so kind and almost grateful that i forgot every thing else in the world a few moments afterwards a friend of lady glanvilles was announced and i left the room </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lv intus et in jecore aegro nascuntur dominipersius the next two or three days i spent in visiting all my male friends in the lower house and engaging them to dine with me preparatory to the great act of voting ons motion i led them myself to the house of commons and not feeling sufficiently interested in the debate to remain as a stranger where i ought in my own opinion to have acted as a performer i went to brookess to wait the result lord gravelton a stout bluff sixfoot nobleman with a voice like a stentor was blowing up the waiters in the coffeeroom mr the author of t was conning the courier in a corner and lord armadilleros the haughtiest and most honourable peer in the calendar was monopolizing the drawingroom with his right foot on one hob and his left on the other i sat myself down in silence and looked over the crack article in the edinburgh by and by the room got fuller every one spoke of the motion before the house and anticipated the merits of the speeches and the numbers of the voters at last a principal member entereda crowd gathered round him i have heard he said the most extraordinary speech for the combination of knowledge and imagination that i ever recollect to have listened to from gaskell i suppose was the universal cry no said mr gaskell has not yet spoken it was from a young man who has only just taken his seat it was received with the most unanimous cheers and was indeed a remarkable display what is his name i asked already half foreboding the answer i only just learnt it as i left the house replied mr the speaker was sir reginald glanville then every one whom i had often before heard censure glanville for his rudeness or laugh at him for his eccentricity opened their mouths in congratulations to their own wisdom for having long admired his talents and predicted his success i left the turba remi sequens fortunam i felt agitated and feverish those who have unexpectedly heard of the success of a man for whom great affection is blended with greater interest can understand the restlessness of mind with which i wandered into the streets the air was cold and nipping i was buttoning my coat round my chest when i heard a voice say you have dropped your glove mr pelham the speaker was thornton i thanked him coldly for his civility and was going on when he said if your way is up pall mall i have no objection to join you for a few minutes i bowed with some hauteur and as i seldom refuse any opportunity of knowing more perfectly individual character i said i should be happy of his company so long as our way lay together it is a cold night mr pelham said thornton after a pause i have been dining at hatchetts with an old paris acquaintance i am sorry we did not meet more often in france but i was so taken up with my friend mr warburton as thornton uttered that name he looked hard at me and then added by the by i saw you with sir reginald glanville the other day you know him well i presume tolerably well said i with indifference what a strange character he is rejoined thornton i also have known him for some years and again thornton looked pryingly into my countenance poor fool it was not for a penetration like his to read the cor inscrutabile of a man born and bred like me in the consummate dissimulation of bon ton he is very rich is he not said thornton after a brief silence i believe so said i humph answered thornton things have grown better with him in proportion as they grew worse with me who have had as good luck as the cow that stuck herself with her own horn i suppose he is not too anxious to recollect mepoverty parts </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> parts fellowship well hang pride say i give me an honest heart all the year round in summer or winter drought or plenty would to god some kind friend would lend me twenty pounds to this wish i made no reply thornton sighed mr pelham renewed he it is true i have known you but a short timeexcuse the liberty i takebut if you could lend me a trifle it would really assist me very much mr thornton said i if i knew you better and could serve you more you might apply to me for a more real assistance than any bagatelle i could afford you would be if twenty pounds would really be of service to you i will lend it you upon this condition that you never ask me for another farthing thorntons face brightened a thousand thousand he began no interrupted i no thanks only your promise upon my honour said thornton i will never ask you for another farthing there is honour among thieves thought i and so i took out the sum mentioned and gave it to him in good earnest though i disliked the man his threadbare garments and altered appearance moved me to compassion while he was pocketing the money which he did with the most unequivocal delight a tall figure passed us rapidly we both turned at the same instant and recognised glanville he had not gone seven yards beyond us before we observed his steps which were very irregular pause suddenly a moment afterwards he fell against the iron rails of an area we hastened towards him he was apparently fainting his countenance was perfectly livid and marked with the traces of extreme exhaustion i sent thornton to the nearest publichouse for some water before he returned glanville had recovered allallin vain he said slowly and unconsciously death is the only lethe he started when he saw me i made him lean on my arm and we walked on slowly i have already heard of your speech said i glanville smiled with the usual faint and sicklied expression which made his smile painful even in its exceeding sweetness you have also already seen its effects the excitement was too much for me it must have been a proud moment when you sat down said i it was one of the bitterest i ever feltit was fraught with the memory of the dead what are all honours to me nowo god o god have mercy upon me and glanville stopped suddenly and put his hand to his temples by this time thornton had joined us when glanvilles eyes rested upon him a deep hectic rose slowly and gradually over his cheeks thorntons lip curled with a malicious expression glanville marked it and his brow grew on the moment as black as night begone he said in a loud voice and with a flashing eye begone instantly i loathe the very sight of so base a thing thorntons quick restless eye grew like a living coal and he bit his lip so violently that the blood gushed out he made however no other answer thanyou seem agitated tonight sir reginald i wish your speedy restoration to better health mr pelham your servant glanville walked on in silence till we came to his door we parted there and for want of any thing better to do i sauntered towards the mhell there were only about ten or twelve persons in the rooms and all were gathered round the hazard tablei looked on silently seeing the knaves devour the fools and younger brothers make up in wit for the deficiencies of fortune the honourable mr blagrave came up to me do you never play said he sometimes was my brief reply lend me a hundred pounds rejoined my kind acquaintance i was just going to make you the same request said i blagrave laughed heartily well said he be my security to a jew and ill be yours my fellow lends me money at only forty per cent my governor is a dd stingy old fellow for i am the most moderate son in the universe i neither hunt nor race nor have i any one favourite expense except gambling and he wont satisfy me in thatnow i call such conduct shameful unheardof barbarity said i and you do well to ruin your property by jews before you have it you could not avenge yourself better on the governor no dme said blagrave leave me alone for that well i have got five pounds left i shall go and slap it down no sooner had he left me than i was accosted by mr goren a handsome little adventurer who lived the devil knew how for the devil seemed to take excellent care of him poor blagrave said he eyeing the countenance of that ingenious youth he is a strange fellowhe asked me the other day if i ever read the history of england and told me there was a great deal in it about his ancestor a roman general in the time of william the conqueror called caractacus he told me at the last newmarket that he had made up a capital book and it turned out that he had hedged with such dexterity that he must lose one thousand pounds and he might lose two well well continued goren with a sanctified expression i would sooner see those real fools here than the confounded scoundrels who pillage one under a false appearance never mr pelham trust to a man at a gaminghouse the honestest look hides the worst sharper shall you try your luck tonight no said i i shall only look on goren sauntered to the table and sat down next to a rich young man of the best temper and the worst luck in the world after a few throws goren said to him lord do put your money asideyou have so much on the table that in interferes with mineand that is really so unpleasant suppose you put some of it in your pocket lordtook a handful of notes and stuffed them carelessly in his coat pocket five minutes afterwards i saw goren insert his hand empty in his neighbours pocket and bring it out fulland half an hour afterwards he handed over a fifty pound note to the marker saying there sir is my debt to you god bless me lord how you have won i wish you would not leave all your money aboutdo put it in your pocket with the rest lordwho had perceived the trick though he was too indolent to resent it laughed no no goren said he you must let me keep some goren coloured and soon after rose dn my luck said he as he passed me i wonder i continue to playbut there are such sharpers in the room avoid a gaming house mr pelham if you wish to live and let live thought i i was just going away when i heard a loud laugh on the stairs and immediately afterwards thornton entered joking with one of the markers he did not see me but approaching the table drew out the identical twenty pound note i had given him and asked for change with the air of a millionaire i did not wait to witness his fortune good or ill i cared too little about it i descended the stairs and the servant on opening the door for me admitted sir john tyrrell what i thought is the habit still so strong we stopped each other and after a few words of greeting i went once more up stairs with him thornton was playing as eagerly with his small quota as lord cwith his ten thousands he nodded with an affected air of familiarity to tyrrell who returned his salutation with the most supercilious hauteur and very soon afterwards the baronet was utterly engrossed by the chances of the game i had however satisfied my curiosity in ascertaining that there was no longer any intimacy between him and thornton and accordingly once more i took my departure </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lvi the times have been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an endbut now they rise againmacbeth it was a strange thing to see a man like glanville with costly tastes luxurious habits great talents peculiarly calculated for display courted by the highest members of the state admired for his beauty and genius by half the women in london yet living in the most ascetic seclusion from his kind and indulging in the darkest and most morbid despondency no female was ever seen to win even his momentary glance of admiration all the senses seemed to have lost for his palate their customary allurements he lived among his books and seemed to make his favourite companions amidst the past at nearly all hours of the night he was awake and occupied and at daybreak his horse was always brought to his door he rode alone for several hours and then on his return he was employed till the hour he went to the house in the affairs and politics of the day ever since his debut he had entered with much constancy into the more leading debates and his speeches were invariably of the same commanding order which had characterised his first it was singular that in his parliamentary display as in his ordinary conversation there were none of the wild and speculative opinions or the burning enthusiasm of romance in which the natural inclination of his mind seemed so essentially to delight his arguments were always remarkable for the soundness of the principles on which they were based and the logical clearness with which they were expressed the feverish fervour of his temperament was it is true occasionally shown in a remarkable energy of delivery or a sudden and unexpected burst of the more impetuous powers of oratory but these were so evidently natural and spontaneous and so happily adapted to be impressive of the subject rather than irrelevant from its bearings that they never displeased even the oldest and coldest cynics and calculators of the house it is no uncommon contradiction in human nature and in glanville it seemed peculiarly prominent to find men of imagination and genius gifted </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> gifted with the strongest common sense for the admonition or benefit of others even while constantly neglecting to exert it for themselves he was soon marked out as the most promising and important of all the junior members of the house and the coldness with which he kept aloof from social intercourse with the party he adopted only served to increase their respect though it prevented their affection lady rosevilles attachment to him was scarcely a secret the celebrity of her name in the world of ton made her least look or action the constant subject of present remark and after conversation and there were too many moments even in the watchful publicity of society when that charming but imprudent person forgot every thing but the romance of her attachment glanville seemed not only perfectly untouched by it but even wholly unconscious of its existence and preserved invariably whenever he was forced into the crowd the same stern cold unsympathizing reserve which made him at once an object of universal conversation and dislike three weeks after glanvilles first speech in the house i called upon him with a proposal from lord dawton after we had discussed it we spoke on more familiar topics and at last he mentioned thornton it will be observed that we had never conversed respecting that person nor had glanville once alluded to our former meetings or to his disguised appearance and false appellation at paris whatever might be the mystery it was evidently of a painful nature and it was not therefore for me to allude to it this day he spoke of thornton with a tone of indifference the man he said i have known for some time he was useful to me abroad and notwithstanding his character i rewarded him well for his services he has since applied to me several times for money which is spent at the gamblinghouse as soon as it is obtained i believe him to be leagued with a gang of sharpers of the lowest description and i am really unwilling any farther to supply the vicious necessities of himself and his comrades he is a mean mercenary rascal who would scruple at no enormity provided he was paid for it glanville paused for a few moments and then added while his cheek blushed and his voice seemed somewhat hesitating and embarrassedyou remember mr tyrrell at paris yes said ihe is at present in london and glanville started as if he had been shot no no he exclaimed wildlyhe died at paris from wantfrom starvation you are mistaken said i he is now sir john tyrrell and possessed of considerable property i saw him myself three weeks ago glanville laying his hand upon my arm looked in my face with a long stern prying gaze and his cheek grew more ghastly and livid with every moment at last he turned and muttered something between his teeth and at that moment the door opened and thornton was announced glanville sprung towards him and seized him by the throat dog he cried you have deceived metyrrell lives hands off cried the gamester with a savage grin of defiancehands off or by the lord that made me you shall have gripe for gripe ho wretch said glanville shaking him violently while his worn and slender yet still powerful frame trembled with the excess of his passion dost thou dare to threaten me and with these words he flung thornton against the opposite wall with such force that the blood gushed out of his mouth and nostrils the gambler rose slowly and wiping the blood from his face fixed his malignant and fiery eye upon his aggressor with an expression of collected hate and vengeance that made my very blood creep it is not my day now he said with a calm quiet cold voice and then suddenly changing his manner he approached me with a sort of bow and made some remark on the weather meanwhile glanville had sunk on the sofa exhausted less by his late effort than the convulsive passion which had produced it he rose in a few moments and said to thornton pardon my violence let this pay your bruises and he placed a long and apparently well filled purse in thorntons hand that veritable philosophe took it with the same air as a dog receives the first caress from the hand which has just chastised him and feeling the purse between his short hard fingers as if to ascertain the soundness of its condition quietly slid it into his breeches pocket which he then buttoned with care and pulling his waistcoat down as if for further protection to the deposit he turned towards glanville and said in his usual quaint style of vulgarityleast said sir reginald the soonest mended gold is a good plaister for bad bruises now then your willask and i will answer unless you think mr pelham un de trop i was already at the door with the intention of leaving the room when glanville cried stay pelham i have but one question to ask mr thornton is john tyrrell still living he is answered thornton with a sardonic smile and beyond all want resumed glanville he is was the tautological reply mr thornton said glanville with a calm voice i have now done with youyou may leave the room thornton bowed with an air of ironical respect and obeyed the command i turned to look at glanville his countenance always better adapted to a stern than a soft expression was perfectly fearful every line in it seemed dug into a furrow the brows were bent over his large and flashing eyes with a painful intensity of anger and resolve his teeth were clenched firmly as if by a vice and the thin upper lip which was drawn from them with a bitter curl of scorn was as white as death his right hand had closed upon the back of the massy chair over which his tall nervous frame leant and was grasping it with an iron force which it could not support it snapped beneath his hand like a hazel stick this accident slight as it was recalled him to himself he apologized with apparent selfpossession for his disorder and after a few words of fervent and affectionate farewell on my part i left him to the solitude which i knew he desired </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lvii while i seemed only intent upon pleasure i locked in my heart the consciousness and vanity of power in the levity of the lip i disguised the knowledge and the workings of the brain and i looked as with a gifted eye upon the mysteries of the hidden depths while i seemed to float an idler with the herd only upon the surface of the stream falkland as i walked home revolving the scene i had witnessed the words of tyrrell came into my recollectionviz that the cause of glanvilles dislike to him had arisen in tyrrells greater success in some youthful liaison in this account i could not see much probability in the first place the cause was not sufficient to produce such an effect and in the second there was little likelihood that the young and rich glanville possessed of the most various accomplishments and the most remarkable personal beauty should be supplanted by a needy spendthrift as tyrrell at that time was of coarse manners and unpolished mind with a person not indeed unprepossessing but somewhat touched by time and never more comparable to glanvilles than that of the satyr to hyperion while i was meditating over a mystery which excited my curiosity more powerfully than anything not relating to himself ought ever to occupy the attention of a wise man i was accosted by vincent the difference in our politics had of late much dissevered us and when he took my arm and drew me up bondstreet i was somewhat surprised at his condescension listen to me pelham he said once more i offer you a settlement in our colony there will be great changes soon trust me so radical a party as that you have adopted can never come in ours on the contrary is no less moderate than liberal this is the last time of asking for i know you will soon have exposed your opinions in public more openly than you have yet done and then it will be too late at present i hold with hudibras and the ancients that it is more honourable far servare civem than slay an adversary alas vincent said i i am marked out for slaughter for you cannot convince me by words and so i suppose you must conquer me by blows adieu this is my way to lord dawtons where are you going to mount my horse and join the parca juventus said vincent with a laugh at his own witticism as we shook hands and parted i grieve much my beloved reader that i cannot unfold to thee all the particulars of my political intrigue i am by the very share which fell to my lot bound over to the strictest secrecy as to its nature and the characters of the chief agents in its execution suffice it to say that the greater part of my time was though furtively employed in a sort of home diplomacy gratifying alike to the activity of my tastes and the vanity of my mind and there were moments when i ventured to grasp in my imagination the highest honours of the state and the most lucrative offices of power i had filled dawton and his coadjutors with an exaggerated opinion of my abilities but i knew well how to sustain it i rose by candlelight and consumed in the intensest application the hours which every other individual of our party wasted in enervating slumbers from the hesternal dissipation or debauch was there a question in political economy debated mine was the readiest and the clearest reply did a period in our constitution become investigated it was i to whom the duty of expositor was referred from madame danville with whom though lost as a lover i constantly corresponded as a friend i obtained the earliest and most accurate detail of the prospects and manoeuvres of the court in which </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> which her life was spent and in whose more secret offices her husband was employed i spared no means of extending my knowledge of every the minutest point which could add to the reputation i enjoyed i made myself acquainted with the individual interests and exact circumstances of all whom it was our object to intimidate or to gain it was i who brought to the house the younger and idler members whom no more nominally powerful agent could allure from the ballroom or the gaminghouse in short while by the dignity of my birth and the independent hauteur of my bearing i preserved the rank of an equal amongst the highest of the set i did not scruple to take upon myself the labour and activity of the most subordinate dawton declared me his right hand and though i knew myself rather his head than his hand i pretended to feel proud of the appellation in truth i only waited for my entree into the house to fix my eye and grasp upon the very situation that nobleman coveted for himself meanwhile it was my pleasure to wear in society the coxcombical and eccentric costume of character i had first adopted and to cultivate the arts which won from women the smile which cheered and encouraged me in my graver contest with men it was only to ellen glanville that i laid aside an affectation which i knew was little likely to attract a taste so refined and unadulterated as hers i discovered in her a mind which while it charmed me by its tenderness and freshness elevated me by its loftiness of thought she was at heart perhaps as ambitious as myself but while my aspirations were concealed by affectation hers were softened by her timidity and purified by her religion there were moments when i opened myself to her and caught a new spirit from her look of sympathy and enthusiasm yes thought i i do long for honours but it is that i may ask her to share and ennoble them in fine i loved as other men lovedand i fancied a perfection in her and vowed an emulation in myself which it was reserved for time to ratify or deride where did i leave myself as the irishman saidon my road to lord dawtons i was lucky enough to find that personage at home he was writing at a table covered with pamphlets and books of reference hush pelham said his lordship who is a quiet grave meditative little man always ruminating on a very small cudhush or do oblige me by looking over this history to find out the date of the council of pisa that will do my young friend said his lordship after i had furnished him with the information he requiredi wish to heaven i could finish this pamphlet by tomorrow it is intended as an answer to but i am so perplexed with business that perhaps said i if you will pardon my interrupting you i can throw your observations togethermake your sibylline leaves into a book your lordship will find the matter and i will not spare the trouble lord dawton was profuse in his thanks he explained the subject and left the arrangement wholly to me he could not presume to dictate i promised him if he lent me the necessary books to finish the pamphlet against the following evening and now said lord dawtonthat we have settled this affairwhat news from france i wish sighed lord dawton as we were calculating our forces that we could gain over lord guloseton what the facetious epicure said i the same answered dawton we want him as a dinnergiver and besides he has four votes in the lower house well said i he is indolent and independentit is not impossible do you know him answered dawton no said i dawton sighedand young a said the statesman after a pause has an expensive mistress and races your lordship might be sure of him were you in power and sure not to have him while you are out of it and b rejoined dawton

<chapter>chapter lviii mangezvous bien monsieur oui et bois encore mieuxmons de porceaugnac my pamphlet took prodigiously the authorship was attributed to the most talented member of the opposition and though there were many errors in style and i now think many sophisms in the reasoning yet it carried the end proposed by all ambition of whatever speciesand imposed upon the taste of the public sometime afterwards i was going down the stairs at almacks when i heard an altercation high and grave at the door of reception to my surprise i found lord guloseton and a very young man in great wrath the latter had never been to almacks before and had forgotten his ticket guloseton who belonged to a very different set to that of the almackians insisted that his word was enough to bear his juvenile companion through the ticket inspector was irate and obdurate and having seldom or ever seen lord guloseton himself paid very little respect to his authority as i was wrapping myself in my cloak guloseton turned to me for passion makes men open their hearts too eager for an opportunity of acquiring the epicures acquaintance i offered to get his friend admittance in an instant the offer was delightedly accepted and i soon procured a small piece of pencilled paper from lady which effectually silenced the charon and opened the stygian via to the elysium beyond guloseton overwhelmed me with his thanks i remounted the stairs with himtook every opportunity of ingratiating myselfreceived an invitation to dinner on the following day and left williss transported at the goodness of my fortune at the hour of eight on the ensuing evening i had just made my entrance into lord gulosetons drawingroom it was a small apartment furnished with great luxury and some taste a venus of titians was placed over the chimneypiece in all the gorgeous voluptuousness of her unveiled beautythe pouting lip not silent though shutthe eloquent lid drooping over the eye whose reveille you could so easily imaginethe armsthe limbsthe attitude so composed yet so redolent of lifeall seemed to indicate that sleep was not forgetfulness and that the dreams of the goddess were not wholly inharmonious with the waking realities in which it was her gentle prerogative to indulge on either side was a picture of the delicate and golden hues of claude these were the only landscapes in the room the remaining pictures were more suitable to the venus of the luxurious italian here was one of the beauties of sir peter lely there was an admirable copy of the hero and leander on the table lay the basia of johannes secundus and a few french works on gastronomy as for the genius lociyou must imagine a middlesized middleaged man with an air rather of delicate than florid health but little of the effects of his good cheer were apparent in the external man his cheeks were neither swollen nor inflatedhis person though not thin was of no unwieldy obesitythe tip of his nasal organ was it is true of a more ruby tinge than the rest and one carbuncle of tender age and gentle dyes diffused its mellow and moonlight influence over the physiognomical sceneryhis forehead was high and bald and the few locks which still rose above it were carefully and gracefully curled a lantique beneath a pair of grey shaggy brows which their noble owner had a strange habit of raising and depressing according to the nature of his remarks rolled two very small piercing arch restless orbs of a tender green and the mouth which was wide and thicklipped was expressive of great sensuality and curved upwards in a perpetual smile such was lord guloseton to my surprise no other guest but myself appeared a new friend said he as we descended into the diningroom is like a new dishone must have him all to oneself thoroughly to enjoy and rightly to understand him a noble precept said i with enthusiasm of all vices indiscriminate hospitality is the most pernicious it allows us neither conversation nor dinner and realizing the mythological fable of tantalus gives us starvation in the midst of plenty you are right said guloseton solemnly i never ask above six persons to dinner and i never dine out for a bad dinner mr pelham a bad dinner is a most seriousi may add the most serious calamity yes i replied for it carries with it no consolation a buried friend may be replaceda lost mistress reneweda slandered character be recoveredeven a broken constitution restored but a dinner once lost is irremediable that day is for ever departed an appetite once thrown away can never till the cruel prolixity of the gastric agents is over be regained il y a tant de maitresses says the admirable corneille il ny a quun diner you speak like an oraclelike the cooks oracle mr pelham may i send you some soup it is a la carmelite but what are you about to do with that case it contains said i my spoon my knife and my fork nature afflicted me with a propensity which through these machines i have endeavoured to remedy by art i eat with too great a rapidity it is a most unhappy failing for one often hurries over in one minute what ought to have afforded the fullest delight for the period of five it is indeed a vice which deadens enjoyment as well as abbreviates it it is a shameful waste of the gifts and a melancholy perversion of the bounty of providence my conscience tormented me but the habit fatally indulged in early childhood was not easy to overcome at last i resolved to construct a spoon of peculiarly shallow dimensions a fork so small that it could only raise a certain portion to my mouth and a knife rendered blunt and jagged so that it required a proper and just time to carve the goods the gods provide me my lord the lovely thais sits beside me in the form of a bottle of madeira suffer me to take wine with you with pleasure my good friend let us drink to </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> to the memory of the carmelites to whom we are indebted for this inimitable soup yes i cried let us for once shake off the prejudices of sectarian faith and do justice to one order of those incomparable men who retiring from the cares of an idle and sinful world gave themselves with undivided zeal and attention to the theory and practice of the profound science of gastronomy it is reserved for us my lord to pay a grateful tribute of memory to those exalted recluses who through a long period of barbarism and darkness preserved in the solitude of their cloisters whatever of roman luxury and classic dainties have come down to this later age we will drink to the carmelites at a sect but we will drink also to the monks as a body had we lived in those days we had been monks ourselves it is singular answered lord gulosetonby the by what think you of this turbotto trace the history of the kitchen it affords the greatest scope to the philosopher and the moralist the ancients seemed to have been more mental more imaginative than we are in their dishes they fed their bodies as well as their minds upon delusion for instance they esteemed beyond all price the tongues of nightingales because they tasted the very music of the birds in the organs of their utterance that is what i call the poetry of gastronomy yes said i with a sigh they certainly had in some respects the advantage over us who can pore over the suppers of apicius without the fondest regret the venerable ude note qthe venerable bedeprinters devil implies that the study has not progressed cookery he says in the first part of his work possesses but few innovators it is with the greatest diffidence said guloseton his mouth full of truth and turbot that we may dare to differ from so great an authority indeed so high is my veneration for that wise man that if all the evidence of my sense and reason were on one side and the dictum of the great ude upon the other i should be inclinedi think i should be determinedto relinquish the former and adopt the latter note see the speech of mr brougham in honour of mr fox bravo my lord cried i warmly quun cuisinier est un mortel divin why should we not be proud of our knowledge in cookery it is the soul of festivity at all times and to all ages how many marriages have been the consequence of meeting at dinner how much good fortune has been the result of a good supper at what moment of our existence are we happier than at table there hatred and animosity are lulled to sleep and pleasure alone reigns here the cook by his skill and attention anticipates our wishes in the happiest selection of the best dishes and decorations here our wants are satisfied our minds and bodies invigorated and ourselves qualified for the high delights of love music poetry dancing and other pleasures and is he whose talents have produced these happy effects to rank no higher in the scale of man than a common servant note ude verbatim yes cries the venerable professor himself in a virtuous and prophetic paroxysm of indignant merityes my disciples if you adopt and attend to the rules i have laid down the selflove of mankind will consent at last that cookery shall rank in the class of the sciences and its professors deserve the name of artists note ibid my dear dear sir exclaimed guloseton with a kindred glow i discover in you a spirit similar to my own let us drink long life to the venerable ude i pledge you with all my soul said i filling my glass to the brim what a pity rejoined guloseton that ude whose practical science was so perfect should ever have written or suffered others to write the work published under his name true it is that the opening part which you have so feelingly recited is composed with a grace a charm beyond the reach of art but the instructions are vapid and frequently so erroneous as to make me suspect their authenticity but after all cooking is not capable of becoming a written scienceit is the philosophy of practice ah by lucullus exclaimed i interrupting my host what a visionary bechamelle oh the inimitable sauce these chickens are indeed worthy of the honour of being dressed never my lord as long as you live eat a chicken in the country excuse a pun you will have foul fare jai toujours redoute la volaille perfide qui brave les efforts dune dent intrepide souvent par un ami dans ses champs entraine jai reconnu le soir le coq infortune qui mavait le matin a laurore naissante reveille brusquement de sa voix glapissante je lavais admire dans le sein de la cour avec des yeux jaloux javais vu son amour helas la malheureux abjurant sa tendresse exercait a souper sa fureur vengeresse pardon the prolixity of my quotation for the sake of its value i do i do answered guloseton laughing at the humour of the lines till suddenly checking himself he said we must be grave mr pelham it will never do to laugh what would become of our digestions true said i relapsing into seriousness and if you will allow me one more quotation you will see what my author adds with regard to any abrupt interruption defendez que personne au milieu dun banquet ne vous vienne donner un avis indiscret ecartez ce facheux qui vers vous sachemine rien ne doit deranger lhonnete homme qui dine admirable advice said guloseton toying with a filet mignon de poulet do you remember an example in the bailly of suffren who being in india was waited upon by a deputation of natives while he was at dinner tell them said he that the christian religion peremptorily forbids every christian while at table to occupy himself with any earthly subject except the function of eating the deputation retired in the profoundest respect at the exceeding devotion of the french general well said i after we had chuckled gravely and quietly with the care of our digestion before us for a few minuteswell however good the invention was the idea is not entirely new for the greeks esteemed eating and drinking plentifully a sort of offering to the gods and aristotle explains the very word thoinai or feasts by an etymological exposition that it was thought a duty to the gods to be drunk no bad idea of our classical patterns of antiquity polypheme too in the cyclops of euripides no doubt a very sound theologian says his stomach is his only deity and xenophon tells us that as the athenians exceeded all other people in the number of their gods so they exceeded them also in the number of their feasts may i send your lordship an ortolan pelham my boy said guloseton whose eyes began to roll and twinkle with a brilliancy suited to the various liquids which ministered to their rejoicing orbs i love you for your classics polypheme was a wise fellow a very wise fellow and it was a terrible shame in ulysses to put out his eye no wonder that the ingenious savage made a deity of his stomach to what known and visible source on this earth was he indebted for a keener enjoymenta more rapturous and a more constant delight no wonder he honoured it with his gratitude and supplied it with his peaceofferingslet us imitate so great an examplelet us make our digestive receptacles a temple to which we will consecrate the choicest goods we possesslet us conceive no pecuniary sacrifice too great which procures for our altar an acceptable giftlet us deem it an impiety to hesitate if a sauce seems extravagant or an ortolan too dear and let our last act in this sublunary existence be a solemn festival in honour of our unceasing benefactor amen to your creed said i edibilatory epicurism holds the key to all morality for do we not see now how sinful it is to yield to an obscene and exaggerated intemperancewould it not be to the last degree ungrateful to the great source of our enjoyment to overload it with a weight which would oppress it with languor or harass it with pain and finally to drench away the effects of our impiety with some nauseous potation which revolts it tortures it convulses irritates enfeebles it through every particle of its system how wrong in us to give way to anger jealousy revenge or any evil passion for does not all that affects the mind operate also upon the stomach and how can we be so vicious so obdurate as to forget for a momentary indulgence our debt to what you have so justly designated our perpetual benefactor right said lord guloseton a bumper to the morality of the stomach the desert was now on the table i have dined well said guloseton stretching his legs with an air of supreme satisfaction but and here my philosopher sighed deeplywe cannot dine again till tomorrow happy happy happy common people who can eat supper would to heaven that i might have one boonperpetual appetitea digestive houri which renewed its virginity every time it was touched alas for the instability of human enjoyment but now that we have no immediate hope to anticipate let us cultivate the pleasures of memory what thought you of the veau a la dauphine pardon me if i hesitate at giving my opinion till i have corrected my judgment by yours why then i own i was somewhat displeaseddisappointed as it werewith that dish the fact is veal ought to be killed in its very first infancy they suffer it to grow to too great an age it becomes a sort of hobbydehoy and possesses nothing of veal but its insipidity or of beef but its toughness yes said i it is only in their veal that the french surpass us their other meats want the ruby juices and elastic freshness of ours monsieur lallowed this truth with a candour worthy of his vast mind mon dieu what claretwhat a body and let me </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> me add what a soul beneath it who would drink wine like this it is only made to taste it is like first lovetoo pure for the eagerness of enjoyment the rapture it inspires is in a touch a kiss it is a pity my lord that we do not serve perfumes at dessert it is their appropriate place in confectionary delicate invention of the sylphs we imitate the forms of the rose and the jessamine why not their odours too what is nature without its scentsand as long as they are absent from our desserts it is in vain that the bard exclaims that lobservateur de la belle nature sextasie en voyant des fleurs en confiture it is an exquisite idea of yours said gulosetonand the next time you dine here we will have perfumes dinner ought to be a reunion of all the senses gladness to the ear nerve heart and sense there was a momentary pause my lord said i what a lusty lusciousness in this pear it is like the style of the old english poets what think you of the seeming good understanding between mr gaskell and the whigs i trouble myself little about it replied guloseton helping himself to some preservespolitics disturb the digestion well thought i i must ascertain some point in this mans character easier to handle than his epicurism all men are vain let us find out the peculiar vanity of mine host the tories said i seem to think themselves exceedingly secure they attach no importance to the neutral members it was but the other day lordtold me that he did not care a straw for mr notwithstanding he possessed four votes heard you ever such arrogance no indeed said golouston with a lazy air of indifferenceare you a favourer of the olive no said i i love it not it hath an under taste of sourness and an upper of oil which do not make harmony to my palate but as i was saying the whigs on the contrary pay the utmost deference to their partizans and a man of fortune rank and parliamentary influence might have all the power without the trouble of a leader very likely said guloseton drowsily i must change my battery thought i but while i was meditating a new attack the

<chapter>chapter lix i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villainwhich to maintain i will allow him oddsshakspeare i found glanville walking before the door with a rapid and uneven step thank heaven he said when he saw mei have been twice to mivarts to find you the second time i saw your servant who told me where you were gone i knew you well enough to be sure of your kindness glanville broke off aburptly and after a short pause said with a quick low hurried tonethe office i wish you to take upon yourself is thisgo immediately to sir john tyrrell with a challenge from me ever since i last saw you i have been hunting out that man and in vain he had then left town he returned this evening and quits it tomorrow you have no time to lose my dear glanville said i i have no wish to learn any secret you would conceal from me but forgive me if i ask for some further instructions than those you have afforded me upon what plea am i to call out sir john tyrrell and what answer am i to give to any excuses he may create i have anticipated your reply said glanville with illsubdued impatience you have only to give this paper it will prevent all discussion read it if you will i have left it unsealed for that purpose i cast my eyes over the lines glanville thrust into my hand they ran thus the time has at length come for me to demand the atonement so long delayed the bearer of this who is probably known to you will arrange with any person you may appoint the hour and place of our meeting he is unacquainted with the grounds of my complaint against you but he is satisfied of my honour your second will i presume be the same with respect to yours it is for me only to question the latter and to declare you solemnly to be void alike of principle and courage a villain and a poltroon reginald glanville you are my earliest friend said i when i had read this soothing epistle and i will not flinch from the place you assign me but i tell you fairly and frankly that i would sooner cut off my right hand than suffer it to give this note to sir john tyrrell glanville made no answer we walked on till he stopped suddenly and said my carriage is at the corner of the street you must go instantly tyrrell lodges at the clarendon you will find me at home on your return i pressed his hand and hurried on my mission it was i own one peculiarly unwelcome and displeasing in the first place i did not love to be made a party in a business of the nature of which i was so profoundly ignorant besides glanville was more dear to me than any one judging only of my external character would suppose and constitutionally indifferent as i am to danger for myself i trembled like a woman at the peril i was instrumental in bringing upon him but what weighed upon me far more than either of these reflections was the recollection of ellen should her brother fall in an engagement in which i was his supposed adviser with what success could i hope for those feelings from her which at present constituted the tenderest and the brightest of my hopes in the midst of these disagreeable ideas the carriage stopped at the door of tyrrels hotel the waiter said sir john was in the coffeeroom thither i immediately marched seated in the box nearest the fire sat tyrrell and two men of that oldfashioned roue set whose members indulged in debauchery as if it were an attribute of manliness and esteemed it as long as it were hearty and english rather a virtue to boast of than a vice to disown tyrrel nodded to me familiarly as i approached him and i saw by the halfemptied bottles before him and the flush of his sallow countenance that he had not been sparing of his libations i whispered that i wished to speak to him on a subject of great importance he rose with much reluctance and after swallowing a large tumblerfull of port wine to fortify him for the task he led the way to a small room where he seated himself and asked me with his usual mixture of bluntness and goodbreeding the nature of my business i made him no reply i contented myself with placing glanvilles billet doux in his hand the room was dimly lighted with a single candle and the small and capricious fire near which the gambler was seated threw its upward light by starts and intervals over the strong features and deep lines of his countenance it would have been a study worthy of rembrandt i drew my chair near him and half shading my eyes with my hand sat down in silence to mark the effect the letter would produce tyrrel i imagine was a man originally of hardy nerves and had been thrown much in the various situations of life where the disguise of all outward emotion is easily and insensibly taught but whether his frame had been shattered by his excesses or that the insulting language of the note touched him to the quick he seemed perfectly unable to govern his feelings the lines were written hastily and the light as i said before was faint and imperfect and he was forced to pause over each word as he proceeded so that the iron had full time to enter into his soul passion however developed itself differently in him than in glanville in the latter it was a rapid transition of powerful feelings one angry wave dashing over another it was the passion of a strong and keenly susceptible mind to which every sting was a dagger and which used the force of a giant to dash away the insect which attacked it in tyrrell it was passion acting on a callous mind but a broken framehis hand trembled violentlyhis voice falteredhe could scarcely command the muscles which enabled him to speak but there was no fiery startno indignant burstno flashing forth of the soul in him it was the body overcoming and paralyzing the mind in glanville it was the mind governing and convulsing the body mr pelham he said at last after a few preliminary efforts to clear his voice this note requires some consideration i know not at present whom to appoint as my secondwill you call upon me early tomorrow i am sorry said i that my sole instructions were to get an immediate answer from you surely either of the gentlemen i saw with you would officiate as your second tyrrell made no reply for some moments he was endeavouring to compose himself and in some measure he succeeded he raised his head with a haughty air of defiance and tearing the paper deliberately though still with uncertain and trembling fingers he stamped his foot upon the atoms tell your principal said he that i retort upon him the foul and false words he has uttered against me that i trample </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> trample upon his assertions with the same scorn i feel towards himself and that before this hour tomorrow i will confront him to death as through life for the rest mr pelham i cannot name my second till the morning leave me your address and you shall hear from me before you are stirring have you any thing farther with me nothing said i laying my card on the table i have fulfilled the most ungrateful charge ever entrusted to me i wish you good night i reentered the carriage and drove to glanvilles i broke into the room rather abruptly glanville was leaning on the table and gazing intently on a small miniature a pistolcase lay beside him one of the pistols in order for use and the other still unarranged the room was as usual covered with books and papers and on the costly cushions of the ottoman lay the large black dog which i remembered well as his companion of yore and which he kept with him constantly as the only thing in the world whose society he could at all times bear the animal lay curled up with its quick black eye fixed watchfully upon its master and directly i entered it uttered though without moving a low warning growl glanville looked up and in some confusion thrust the picture into a drawer of the table and asked me my news i told him word for word what had passed glanville set his teeth and clenched his hand firmly and then as if his anger was at once appeased he suddenly changed the subject and tone of our conversation he spoke with great cheerfulness and humour on the various topics of the day touched upon politics laughed at lord guloseton and seemed as indifferent and unconscious of the event of the morrow as my peculiar constitution would have rendered myself when i rose to depart for i had too great an interest in him to feel much for the subjects he conversed on he said i shall write one line to my mother and another to my poor sister you will deliver them if i fall for i have sworn that one of us shall not quit the ground alive i shall be all impatience to know the hour you will arrange with tyrrells second god bless you and farewell for the present </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lx charge chester chargemarmion though this was one of the first mercantile transactions of my life i had no doubt about acquitting myself with reputationvicar of wakefield the next morning i was at breakfast when a packet was brought me from tyrrell it contained a sealed letter to glanville and a brief note to myself the latter i transcribe my dear sir the enclosed letter to sir reginald glanville will explain my reasons for not keeping my pledge suffice it to state to you that they are such as wholly to exonerate me and fairly to satisfy sir reginald it will be useless to call upon me i leave town before you will receive this respect for myself obliges me to add that although there are circumstances to forbid my meeting sir reginald glanville there are none to prevent my demanding satisfaction of any one whoever he may be who shall deem himself authorized to call my motives into question i have the honour john tyrrell it was not till i had thrice read this letter that i could credit its contents from all i had seen of tyrrells character i had no reason to suspect him to be less courageous than the generality of worldly men and the conclusion of his letter evidently pointed at myself should i venture to impugn his conduct seemed by no means favourable to any suspicion of his cowardice and yet when i considered the violent language of glanvilles letter and tyrrells apparent resolution the night before i scarcely knew to what more honourable motive to attribute his conduct however i lost no time in despatching the whole packet to glanville with a few lines from myself saying i should call in an hour when i fulfilled this promise glanvilles servant told me his master had gone out immediately on reading the letters i had sent and had merely left word that he should not return home the whole day that night he was to have brought an important motion before the house a message from him pleading sudden and alarming illness devolved this duty upon another member of our party lord dawton was in despair the motion was lost by a great majority the papers the whole of that week were filled with the most triumphant abuse and ridicule of the whigs never was that unhappy and persecuted party reduced to so low an ebb never did there seem a fainter probability of their coming into power they appeared almost annihilateda mere nominis umbra on the eighth day from glanvilles disappearance a sudden event in the cabinet threw the whole country into confusion the tories trembled to the very soles of their easy slippers of sinecure and office the eyes of the public were turned to the whigs and chance seemed to effect in an instant that change in their favour which all their toil trouble eloquence and art had been unable for so many years to render even a remote probability but there was a strong though secret party in the state which reminded me of the independents in the reign of charles the first that concealed under a general name worked only for a private end and made a progress in number and respectability not the less sure for being but little suspected foremost among the leaders of this party was lord vincent dawton who knew of their existence and regarded them with fear and jealousy considered the struggle rather between them and himself than any longer between himself and the tories and strove while it was yet time to reinforce himself by a body of allies which should the contest really take place might be certain of giving him the superiority the marquis of chester was among the most powerful of the neutral noblemen it was of the greatest importance to gain him to the cause he was a sturdy sporting independent man who lived chiefly in the country and turned his ambition rather towards promoting the excellence of quadrupeds than the bad passions of men to this personage lord dawton implored me to be the bearer of a letter and to aid with all the dexterity in my power the purpose it was intended to effect it was the most consequential mission yet entrusted to me and i felt eager to turn my diplomatic energies to so good an account accordingly one bright morning i wrapped myself carefully in my cloak placed my invaluable person safely in my carriage and set off to chester park in the county of suffolk </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxi hinc canibus blandis rabies venitvirgil georgics i should have mentioned that the day after i sent glanville tyrrells communication i received a short and hurried note from the former saying that he had left london in pursuit of tyrrell and that he would not rest till he had brought him to account in the hurry of the public events in which i had been of late so actively engaged my mind had not had leisure to dwell much upon glanville but when i was alone in my carriage that singular being and the mystery which attended him forced themselves upon my reflection in spite of all the importance of my mission i was leaning back in my carriage at i think ware while they were changing horses when a voice strongly associated with my meditations struck upon my ear i looked out and saw thornton standing in the yard attired with all his original smartness of boot and breeches he was employed in smoking a cigar sipping brandy and water and exercising his conversational talents in a mixture of slang and jokeyism addressed to two or three men of his own rank of life and seemingly his companions his brisk eye soon discovered me and he swaggered to the carriage door with that ineffable assurance of manner which was so peculiarly his own ah ah mr pelham said he going to newmarket i suppose bound there myselflike to be found among my betters ha haexcuse a pun what odds on the favourite what you wont bet mr pelham close and sly at present well the silent sow sups up all the brotheh im not going to newmarket i replied i never attend races indeed answered thornton well if i was as rich as you i would soon make or spend a fortune on the course seen sir john tyrrell no he is to be there nothing can cure him of gamblingwhats bred in the bone good day mr pelhamwont keep you any longersharp shower coming on the devil will soon be basting his wife with a leg of mutton as the proverb saysau plaisir mr pelham and at these words my postboy started and released me from my bete noire i spare my reader an account of my miscellaneous reflections on thornton dawton vincent politics glanville and ellen and will land him without further delay at chester park i was ushered through a large oak hall of the reign of james the first into a room strongly resembling the principal apartment of a club two or three round tables were covered with newspapers journals racing calendars an enormous fireplace was crowded with men of all ages i had almost said of all ranks but however various they might appear in their mien and attire they were wholly of the patrician order one thing however in this room belied its similitude to the apartment of a club viz a number of dogs that lay in scattered groups upon the floor before the windows were several horses in bodycloths led or rode to exercise upon a plain in the park levelled as smooth as a bowlinggreen at putney and stationed at an oriel window in earnest attention to the scene without were two men the tallest of these was lord chester there was a stiffness and inelegance in his address which prepossessed me strongly against him </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> him les manieres que lon neglige comme de petites choses sont souvent ce qui fait que les hommes decident de vous en bien ou en mal the manners which one neglects as trifles are often precisely that by which men decide on you favourably or the reverse i had long since when i was at the university been introduced to lord chester but i had quite forgotten his person and he the very circumstance i said in a low tone that i was the bearer of a letter of some importance from our mutual friend lord dawton and that i should request the honour of a private interview at lord chesters first convenience his lordship bowed with an odd mixture of the civility of a jockey and the hauteur of a head groom of the stud and led the way to a small apartment which i afterwards discovered he called his own i never could make out by the way why in england the very worst room in the house is always appropriated to the master of it and dignified by the appellation of the gentlemans own i gave the newmarket grandee the letter intended for him and quietly seating myself awaited the result he read it through slowly and silently and then taking out a huge pocketbook full of racing bets horses ages jockey opinions and such like memoranda he placed it with much solemnity among this dignified company and then said with a cold but wouldbe courteous air my friend lord dawton says you are entirely in his confidence mr pelham i hope you will honour me with your company at chester park for two or three days during which time i shall have leisure to reply to lord dawtons letter will you take some refreshment i answered the first sentence in the affirmative and the latter in the negative and lord chester thinking it perfectly unnecessary to trouble himself with any further questions or remarks which the whole jockey club might not hear took me back into the room we had quitted and left me to find or make whatever acquaintance i could pampered and spoiled as i was in the most difficult circles of london i was beyond measure indignant at the cavalier demeanour of this rustic thane whom i considered a being as immeasurably beneath me in every thing else as he really was in antiquity of birth and i venture to hope in cultivation of intellect i looked round the room and did not recognize a being of my acquaintance i seemed literally thrown into a new world the very language in which the conversation was held sounded strange to my ear i had always transgressed my general rule of knowing all men in all grades in the single respect of sporting characters they were a species of bipeds that i would never recognize as belonging to the human race alas i now found the bitter effects of not following my usual maxims it is a dangerous thing to encourage too great a disdain of ones inferiors pride must have a fall after i had been a whole quarter of an hour in this strange place my better genius came to my aid since i found no society among the twolegged brutes i turned to the quadrupeds at one corner of the room lay a black terrier of the true english breed at another was a short sturdy wirey one of the scotch i soon formed a friendship with each of these canine pelei little bodies with great souls and then by degrees alluring them from their retreat to the centre of the room i fairly endeavoured to set them by the ears thanks to the national antipathy i succeeded to my hearts content the contest soon aroused the other individuals of the genusup they started from their repose like roderic dhus merry men and incontinently flocked to the scene of battle to it said i and i took one by the leg and another by the throat and dashing them against each other turned all their peevish irascibility at the affront into mutual aggression in a very few moments the whole room was a scene of uproarious confusion the beasts yelled and bit and struggled with the most delectable ferocity to add to the effect the various owners of the dogs crowded roundsome to stimulate others to appease the fury of the combatants as for me i flung myself into an arm chair and gave way to an excess of merriment which only enraged the spectators more many were the glances of anger many the murmurs of reproach directed against me lord chester himself eyed me with an air of astonished indignation that redoubled my hilarity at length the conflict was assuagedby dint of blows and kicks and remonstrances from their dignified proprietors the dogs slowly withdrew one with the loss of half an ear another with a shoulder put out a third with a mouth increased by onehalf of its natural dimensions in short every one engaged in the conflict bore some token of its severity i did not wait for the thunderstorm i foresaw i rose with a nonchalant yaw n of ennuimarched out of the apartment

</chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxii noster ludos spectaverat una luserat in campo fortunae filius omnes horace i did not leave my room till the first dinnerbell had ceased a sufficient time to allow me the pleasing hope that i should have but a few moments to wait in the drawingroom previous to the grand epoch and ceremony of an european day the manner most natural to me is one rather open and easy but i pique myself peculiarly upon a certain though occasional air which keeps impertinence aloof in fine i am by no means a person with whom others would lightly take a liberty or to whom they would readily offer or resent an affront this day i assumed a double quantum of dignity in entering a room which i well knew must be filled with my enemies there were a few women round lady chester and as i always feel reassured by a sight of the dear sex i walked towards them judge of my delight when i discovered amongst the group lady harriett garrett it is true that i had no particular predilection for that lady but the sight of a negress i had seen before i should have hailed with rapture in so desolate and inhospitable a place if my pleasure at seeing lady harriett was great hers seemed equally so at receiving my salutation she asked me if i knew lady chesterand on my negative reply immediately introduced me to that personage i now found myself quite at home my spirits rose and i exerted every nerve to be as charming as possible in youth to endeavour is to succeed i gave a most animated account of the canine battle interspersed with various sarcasms on the owners of the combatants which were by no means illreceived either by the marchioness or her companions and in fact when the dinner was announced they all rose in a mirth sufficiently unrestrained to be any thing but patrician for my part i offered my arm to lady harriett and paid her as many compliments on crossing the suite that led to the diningroom as would have turned a much wiser head than her ladyships the dinner went off agreeably enough as long as the women stayed but the moment they quitted the room i experienced exactly the same feeling known unto a mothers darling left for the first time at that strange cold comfortless placeycleped a school i was not however in a mood to suffer my flowers of oratory to blush unseen besides it was absolutely necessary that i should make a better impression upon my host i leant therefore across the table and listened eagerly to the various conversations afloat at last i perceived on the opposite side sir lionel garrett a personage whom i had not before even inquired after or thought of he was busily and noisily employed in discussing the gamelaws thank heaven thought i i shall be on firm ground there the general interest of the subject and the loudness with which it was debated soon drew all the scattered conversation into one focus what said sir lionel in a high voice to a modest shrinking youth probably from cambridge who had supported the liberal side of the questionwhat are our interests to be never consulted are we to have our only amusement taken away from us what do you imagine brings country gentlemen to their seats do you not know sir the vast importance our residence at our country houses is to the nation destroy the game laws and you destroy our very existence as a people now thought i it is my time sir lionel said i speaking almost from one end of the table to the other i perfectly agree with your sentiments i am entirely of opinion first that it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the nation that game should be preserved secondly that if you take away game you take away country gentlemen no two propositions can be clearer than these but i do differ from you with respect to the intended alterations let us put wholly out of the question the interests of the poor people or of society at large those are minor matters not worthy of a moments consideration let us only see how far our interests as sportsmen will be affected i think by a very few words i can clearly prove to you that the proposed alterations will make us much better off than we are at present i then entered shortly yet fully enough into the nature of the laws as they now stood and as they were intended to be changed i first spoke of the two great disadvantages of the present system to country gentlemen viz in the number of poachers and the expense of preserving observing that i was generally and attentively listened to i dwelt upon these </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> these two points with much pathetic energy and having paused till i had got sir lionel and one or two of his supporters to confess that it would be highly desirable that these defects should if possible be remedied i proceeded to show how and in what manner it was possible i argued that to effect this possibility was the exact object of the alterations suggested i anticipated the objections i answered them in the form of propositions as clearly and concisely stated as possible and as i spoke with great civility and conciliation and put aside every appearance of care for any human being in the world who was not possessed of a qualification i perceived at the conclusion of my harangue that i had made a very favourable impression that evening completed my triumph for lady chester and lady harriett made so good a story of my adventure with the dogs that the matter passed off as a famous joke and i was soon considered by the whole knot as a devilish amusing goodnatured sensible fellow so true is it that there is no situation which a little tact cannot turn to our own account manage yourself well and you may manage all the world as for lord chester i soon won his heart by a few feats of horsemanship and a few extempore inventions respecting the sagacity of dogs three days after my arrival we became inseparable and i made such good use of my time that in two more he spoke to me of his friendship for dawton and his wish for a dukedom these motives it was easy enough to unite and at last he promised me that his answer to my principal should be as acquiescent as i could desire the morning after this promise commenced the great day at newmarket our whole party were of course bound to the raceground and with great reluctance i was pressed into the service we were not many miles distant from the course and lord chester mounted me on one of his horses our shortest way lay through rather an intricate series of cross roads and as i was very little interested in the conversation of my companions i paid more attention to the scenery we passed than is my customary wont for i study nature rather in men than fields and find no landscape afford such variety to the eye and such subject to the contemplation as the inequalities of the human heart but there were to be fearful circumstances hereafter to stamp forcibly upon my remembrance some traces of the scenery which now courted and arrested my view the chief characteristics of the country were broad dreary plains diversified at times by dark plantations of fir and larch the road was rough and stony and here and there a melancholy rivulet swelled by the first rains of spring crossed our path and lost itself in the rank weeds of some inhospitable marsh about six miles from chester park to the left of the road stood an old house with a new face the brown timehonoured bricks which composed the fabric were strongly contrasted by large venetian windows newly inserted in frames of the most ostentatious white a smart green veranda scarcely finished ran along the low portico and formed the termination to two thin rows of meagre and dwarfish sycamores which did duty for an avenue and were bounded on the roadside by a spruce white gate and a sprucer lodge so moderate in its dimensions that it would scarcely have boiled a turnip if a rat had got into it he might have run away with it the ground was dug in various places as if for the purpose of further improvements and here and there a sickly little tree was carefully hurdled round and seemed pining its puny heart out at the confinement in spite of all these welljudged and wellthriving graces of art there was such a comfortless and desolate appearance about the place that it quite froze one to look at it to be sure a damp marsh on one side and the skeleton rafters and beams of an old stable on the other backed by a few dull and sulkylooking fir trees might in some measure create or at least considerably add to the indescribable cheerlessness of the tout ensemble while i was curiously surveying the various parts of this northern delices and marvelling at the choice of two crows who were slowly walking over the unwholesome ground instead of making all possible use of the black wings with which providence had gifted them i perceived two men on horseback wind round from the back part of the building and proceed in a brisk trot down the avenue we had not advanced many paces before they overtook us the foremost of them turned round as he passed me and pulling up his horse abruptly discovered to my dismayed view the features of mr thornton nothing abashed by the slightness of my bow or the grave stares of my lordly companions who never forgot the dignity of their birth in spite of the vulgarity of their tastes thornton instantly and familiarly accosted me told you so mr pelhamsilent sow sure i should have the pleasure of seeing you though you kept it so snug well will you bet now noah youre a sly one staying here at that nicelooking housebelongs to dawson an old friend of mineshall be happy to introduce you sir said i abruptly you are too good permit me to request that you will rejoin your friend mr dawson oh said the imperturbable thornton it does not signify he wont be affronted at my lagging a little however and here he caught my eye which was assuming a sternness that perhaps little pleased him however as it gets late and my mare is none of the best ill wish you good morning with these words thornton put spurs to his horse and trotted off who the devil have you got there pelham said lord chester a person said i who picked me up at paris and insists on the right of treasure trove to claim me in england but will you let me ask in my turn whom that cheerful mansion we have just left belongs to to a mr dawson whose father was a gentleman farmer who bred horses a very respectable person for i made one or two excellent bargains with him the son was always on the turf and contracted the worst of its habits he bears but a very indifferent character and will probably become a complete blackleg he married a short time since a woman of some fortune and i suppose it is her taste which has so altered and modernized his house come gentlemen we are on even ground shall we trot we proceeded but a few yards before we were again stopped by a precipitous ascent and as lord chester was then earnestly engaged in praising his horse to one of the cavalcade i had time to remark the spot at the foot of the hill we were about slowly to ascend was a broad uninclosed patch of waste land a heron flapping its enormous wings as it rose directed my attention to a pool overgrown with rushes and halfsheltered on one side by a decayed tree which if one might judge from the breadth and hollowness of its trunk had been a refuge to the wild bird and a shelter to the wild cattle at a time when such were the only intruders upon its hospitality and when the country for miles and leagues round was honoured by as little of mans care and cultivation as was at present the rank waste which still nourished its gnarled and venerable roots there was something remarkably singular and grotesque in the shape and sinuosity of its naked and spectral branches two of exceeding length stretched themselves forth in the very semblance of arms held out in the attitude of supplication and the bend of the trunk over the desolate pond the form of the hoary and blasted summit and the hollow trunk half riven asunder in the shape of limbs seemed to favour the gigantic deception you might have imagined it an antediluvian transformation or a daughter of the titan race preserving in her metamorphosis her attitude of entreaty to the merciless olympian this was the only tree visible for a turn of the road and the unevenness of the ground completely veiled the house we had passed and the few low firs and sycamores which made its only plantations the sullen poolits ghostlike guardianthe dreary heath around the rude features of the country beyond and the apparent absence of all human habitation conspired to make a scene of the most dispiriting and striking desolation i know not how to account for it but as i gazed around in silence the whole place appeared to grow over my mind as one which i had seen though dimly and drearily before and a nameless and unaccountable presentiment of fear and evil sunk like ice into my heart we ascended the hill and the rest of the road being of a kind better adapted to expedition we mended our pace and soon arrived at the goal of our journey the raceground had its customary compliment of knaves and foolsthe dupers and the duped poor lady chester who had proceeded to the ground by the high road for the way we had chosen was inaccessible to those who ride in chariots and whose charioteers are set up in high places was driving to and fro the very picture of cold and discomfort and the few solitary carriages which honoured the course looked as miserable as if they were witnessing the funeral of their owners persons rather than the peril of their characters and purses as we rode along to the bettingpost sir john tyrrell passed us lord chester accosted him familiarly and the baronet joined us he had been an old votary of the turf in his younger days and he still preserved all his ancient predilection in its favour it seemed that chester had not met him for many years and after a short and characteristic conversation of god </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> god bless me how long since i saw youdd good horse youre onyou look thinadmirable conditionwhat have you been doinggrand actionant we behind handfamous forehandrecollect old queensberryhot in the mouthgone to the devilwhat are the odds lord chester asked tyrrell to go home with us the invitation was readily accepted with impotence of will we wheel tho ghastly shadows interpose round us and round each othershelley now then arose the noise the clatter the swearing the lying the perjury the cheating the crowd the bustle the hurry the rush the heat the ardour the impatience the hope the terror the rapture the agony of the race directly the first heat was over one asked me one thing one bellowed another i fled to lord chester he did not heed me i took refuge with the marchioness she was as sullen as an east wind could make her lady harriett would talk of nothing but the horses sir lionel would not talk at all i was in the lowest pit of despondency and the devils that kept me there were as blue as lady chesters nose silent sad sorrowful and sulky i rode away from the crowd and moralized on its vicious propensities one grows marvellously honest when the species of cheating before us is not suited to ones self fortunately my better angel reminded me that about the distance of three miles from the course lived an old college friend blessed since we had met with a parsonage and a wife i knew his tastes too well to imagine that any allurement of an equestrian nature could have seduced him from the ease of his library and the dignity of his books and hoping therefore that i should find him at home i turned my horses head in an opposite direction and rejoiced at the idea of my escape bade adieu to the course as i cantered across the far end of the heath my horse started from an object upon the ground it was a man wrapped from head to foot in a long horsemans cloak and so well guarded as to the face from the raw inclemency of the day that i could not catch even a glimpse of the features through the hat and neckshawl which concealed them the head was turned with apparent anxiety towards the distant throng and imagining the man belonging to the lower orders with whom i am always familiar i addressed to him en passant some trifling remark on the event of the race he made no answer there was something about him which induced me to look back several moments after i had left him behind he had not moved an atom there is such a certain uncomfortableness always occasioned to the mind by stillness and mystery united that even the disguising garb and motionless silence of the man innocent as i thought they must have been impressed themselves disagreeably on my meditations as i rode briskly on it is my maxim never to be unpleasantly employed even in thought if i can help it accordingly i changed the course of my reflection and amused myself with wondering how matrimony and clerical dignity sat on the indolent shoulders of my old acquaintance </chapter>

is game none that fro my bookes maketh me to gonechaucer christopher clutterbuck was a common individual of a common order but little known in this busy and toiling world i cannot flatter myself that i am about to present to your notice that rara avis a new characteryet there is something interesting and even unhacknied in the retired and simple class to which he belongs and before i proceed to a darker period in my memoirs i feel a calm and tranquillizing pleasure in the rest which a brief and imperfect delineation of my college companion affords me my friend came up to the university with the learning one about to quit the world might with credit have boasted of possessing and the simplicity one about to enter it would have been ashamed to confess quiet and shy in his habits and his manners he was never seen out of the precincts of his apartment except in obedience to the stated calls of dinner lectures and chapel then his small and stooping form might be marked crossing the quadrangle with a hurried step and cautiously avoiding the smallest blade of the barren grassplots which are forbidden ground to the feet of all the lower orders of the collegiate oligarchy many were the smiles and the jeers from the worse natured and better appointed students who loitered idly along the court at the rude garb and saturnine appearance of the humble undergraduate and the calm countenance of the grave but amiable man who then bore the honour and onus of mathematical lecturer at our college would soften into a glance of mingled approbation and pity as he noted the eagerness which spoke from the wan cheek and emaciated frame of the ablest of his pupils hurryingafter each legitimate interruptionto the enjoyment of the crabbed characters and wormworn volumes which contained for him all the seductions of pleasure and all the temptations of youth it is a melancholy thing which none but those educated at a college can understand to see the debilitated frames of the aspirants for academical honours to mark the primethe verdurethe glorythe lifeof life wasted irrevocably away in a labor ineptiarum which brings no harvest either to others or themselves for the poet the philosopher the man of science we can appreciate the recompence if we commiserate the sacrifice from the darkness of their retreat there goes a lightfrom the silence of their studies there issues a voice to illumine or convince we can imagine them looking from their privations to the far visions of the future and hugging to their hearts in the strength of no unnatural vanity the reward which their labours are certain hereafter to obtain to those who can anticipate the vast dominions of immortality among men what boots the sterility of the cabined and petty present but the mere man of languages and learningthe machine of a memory heavily but unprofitably employedthe columbus wasting at the galley oar the energies which should have discovered a worldfor him there is no daydream of the future no grasp at the immortality of fame beyond the walls of his narrow room he knows no object beyond the elucidation of a dead tongue he indulges no ambition his life is one long schoolday of lexicons and grammarsa fabric of ice cautiously excluded from a single sunbeamelaborately useless ingeniously unprofitable and leaving at the moment it melts away not a single trace of the space it occupied or the labour it cost at the time i went to the university my poor collegian had attained all the honours his employment could ever procure him he had been a pitt scholar he was a senior wrangler and a fellow of his college it often happened that i found myself next to him at dinner and i was struck by his abstinence and pleased with his modesty despite of the gaucherie of his manner and the fashion of his garb by degrees i insinuated myself into his acquaintance and as i had still some love of scholastic lore i took frequent opportunities of conversing with him upon horace and consulting him upon lucian many a dim twilight have we sat together reviving each others recollection and occasionally relaxing into the grave amusement of capping verses then if by any chance my ingenuity or memory enabled me to puzzle my companion his good temper would lose itself in a quaint pettishness or he would cite against me some line of aristophanes and ask me with a raised voice and arched brow to give him a fitting answer to that but if as was much more frequently the case he fairly run me down into a pause and confession of inability he would rub his hands with a strange chuckle and offer me in the bounteousness of his heart to read aloud a greek ode of his own while he treated me to a dish of tea there was much in the good mans innocence and guilelessness of soul which made me love him and i did not rest till i had procured him before i left the university the living which he now held since then he had married the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman an event of which he had duly informed me but though this great step in the life of a reading man had not taken place many months since i had completely after a hearty wish for his domestic happiness consigned it to a dormant place in my recollection the house which i now began to approach was small but comfortable perhaps there was something triste in the oldfashioned hedges cut and trimmed with mathematical precision which surrounded the glebe as well as in the heavy architecture and dingy bricks of the reverend recluses habitation to make amends for this there was also something peculiarly still and placid about the appearance of the house which must have suited well the tastes and habits of the owner a small formal lawn was adorned with a square fishpond bricked round and covered with the green weepings of four willows which drooped over it from their station at each corner at the opposite side of this pierian reservoir was a hermitage or arbour of laurels shaped in the stiff rusticity of the dutch school in the prevalence of which it was probably planted behind this arbour the ground after a slight railing terminated in an orchard the sound i elicited from the gate bell seemed to ring through that retired place with singular shrillness and i observed at the opposite window all that bustle of drawing curtains peeping faces and hasty retreats which denote female anxiety and perplexity at the unexpected approach of a stranger after some time the parsons single servant a middleaged slovenly man in a loose frock and buff </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> buff kerseymere nondescripts opened the gate and informed me that his master was at home with a few earnest admonitions to my admittorwho was like the domestics of many richer men both groom and valetrespecting the safety of my borrowed horse i entered the house the servant did not think it necessary to inquire my name but threw open the door of the study with the brief introduction ofa gentleman sir clutterbuck was standing with his back towards me upon a pair of library steps turning over some dusky volumes and below stood a pale cadaverous youth with a set and serious countenance that bore no small likeness to clutterbuck himself mon dieu thought i he cannot have made such good use of his matrimonial state as to have raised this lanky impression of himself in the space of seven months the good man turned round and almost fell off the steps with the nervous shock of beholding me so near him he descended with precipitation and shook me so warmly and tightly by the hand that he brought tears into my eyes as well as his own gently my good friend said iparce precor or you will force me to say ibimus una ambo flentes valido connexi foedere clutterbucks eyes watered still more when he heard the grateful sounds of what to him was the mother tongue he surveyed me from head to foot with an air of benign and fatherly complacency and dragging forth from its sullen rest a large arm chair on whose cushions of rusty horsehair sat an eternal cloud of classic dust too sacred to be disturbed he plumped me down upon it before i was aware of the cruel hospitality oh my nether garments thought i quantus sudor incrit bedoso to restore you to your pristine purity but whence come you said my host who cherished rather a formal and antiquated method of speech from the pythian games said i the campus hight newmarket do i see right or is not yon insignis juvenis marvellously like you of a surety he rivals the titans if he is only a seven months child now truly my worthy friend answered clutterbuck you indulge in jesting the boy is my nephew a goodly child and a painstaking i hope he will thrive at our gentle mother he goes to trinity next october benjamin jeremiah my lad this is my worthy friend and benefactor of whom i have often spoken go and order him of our besthe will partake of our repast no really i began but clutterbuck gently placed the hand whose strength of affection i had already so forcibly experienced upon my mouth pardon me my friend said he no stranger should depart till he had broken bread with us how much more then a friend go benjamin jeremiah and tell your aunt that mr pelham will dine with us and order furthermore that the barrel of oysters sent unto us as a present by my worthy friend dr swallowem be dressed in the fashion that seemeth best they are a classic dainty and we shall think of our great masters the ancients whilst we devour them andstop benjamin jeremiah see that we have the wine with the black seal andnowgo benjamin jeremiah well my old friend said i when the door closed upon the sallow and smileless nephew how do you love the connubiale jugum do you give the same advice as socrates i hope at least it is not from the same experience hem answered the grave christopher in a tone that struck me as somewhat nervous and uneasy you are become quite a humourist since we parted i suppose you have been warming your wit by the lambent fires of horace and aristophanes no said i the living allow those whose toilsome lot it is to mix constantly with them but little time to study the monuments of the dead but in sober earnest are you as happy as i wish you clutterbuck looked down for a moment and then turning towards the table laid one hand upon a ms and pointed with the other to his books with this society said he how can i be otherwise i gave him no reply but put my hand upon his ms he made a modest and coy effort to detain it but i knew that writers were like women and making use of no displeasing force i possessed myself of the paper it was a treatise on the greek participle my heart sickened within me but as i caught the eager glance of the poor author i brightened up my countenance into an expression of pleasure and appeared to read and comment upon the difficiles nugae with an interest commensurate to his own meanwhile the youth returned he had much of that delicacy of sentiment which always accompanies mental cultivation of whatever sort it may be he went with a scarlet blush over his thin face to his uncle and whispered something in his ear which from the angry embarrassment it appeared to occasion i was at no loss to divine come said i we are too long acquainted for ceremony your placens uxor like all ladies in the same predicament thinks your invitation a little unadvised and in real earnest i have so long a ride to perform that i would rather eat your oysters another day no no said clutterbuck with greater eagerness than his even temperament was often hurried into betrayingno i will go and reason with her myself wives obey your husbands saith the preacher and the quondam senior wrangler almost upset his chair in the perturbation with which he arose from it i laid my hand upon him let me go myself said i since you will have me dine with you the sex is ever to a stranger kind and i shall probably be more persuasive than you in despite of your legitimate authority so saying i left the room with a curiosity more painful than pleasing to see the collegians wife i arrested the man servant and ordered him to usher and announce me i was led instanter into the apartment where i had discovered all the signs of female inquisitiveness which i have before detailed there i discovered a small woman in a robe equally slatternly and fine with a sharp pointed nose small cold grey eyes and a complexion high towards the cheek bones but waxing of a light green before it reached the wide and querulous mouth which well i ween seldom opened to smile upon the unfortunate possessor of her charms she like the rev christopher was not without her companions a tall meagre woman of advanced age and a girl some years younger than herself were introduced to me as her mother and sister my entree occasioned no little confusion but i knew well how to remedy that i held out my hand so cordially to the wife that i enticed though with evident reluctance two bony fingers into my own which i did not dismiss without a most mollifying and affectionate squeeze and drawing my chair close towards her began conversing as familiarly as if i had known the whole triad for years i declared my joy at seeing my old friend so happily settledcommented on the improvement of his looksventured a sly joke at the good effects of matrimonypraised a cat couchant worked in worsted by the venerable hand of the eldest matronoffered to procure her a real cat of the true persian breed black ears four inches long with a tail like a squirrels and then slid all at once into the unauthorized invitation of the good man of the house clutterbuck said i has asked me very warmly to stay dinner but before i accepted his offer i insisted upon coming to see how far it was confirmed by you gentlemen you are aware my dear madam know nothing of these matters and i never accept a married mans invitation till it has the sanction of his lady i have an example of that at home my mother lady frances is the besttempered woman in the world but my father could no more take the liberty for i may truly call it such to ask even his oldest friend to dinner without consulting the mistress of the house than he could think of flying no one says my mother and she says what is very true can tell about the household affairs but those who have the management of them and in pursuance of this aphorism i dare not accept any invitation in this house except from its mistress really said mrs clutterbuck colouring with mingled embarrassment and gratification you are very considerate and polite mr pelham i only wish mr clutterbuck had half your attention to these things nobody can tell the trouble and inconvenience he puts me to if i had known a little time before that you were comingbut now i fear we have nothing in the house but if you can partake of our fare such as it is mr pelham your kindness enchants me i exclaimed and i no longer scruple to confess the pleasure i have in accepting my old friends offer this affair being settled i continued to converse for some minutes with as much vivacity as i could summon to my aid and when i went once more to the library it was with the comfortable impression of having left those as friends whom i had visited as foes the dinner hour was four and till it came clutterbuck and i amused ourselves in commune wise and sage there was something high in the sentiments and generous in the feelings of this man which made me the more regret the bias of mind which rendered them so unavailing at college he had never illis dissimilis in nostro tempore natis cringed to the possessors of clerical power in the duties of his station as dean of the college he was equally strict to the black cap and the lordly hat nay when one of his private pupils whose father was possessed of more church preferment than any nobleman in the peerage disobeyed his repeated summons and constantly neglected to attend his instructions he sent for him </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> him resigned his tuition and refused any longer to accept a salary which the negligence of his pupil would not allow him to requite in his clerical tenets he was high in his judgment of others he was mild his knowledge of the liberty of greece was not drawn from the ignorant historian of her republics note it is really a disgrace to the university that any of its colleges should accept as a reference or even tolerate as an author the presumptuous bigot who has bequeathed to us in his history of greece the masterpiece of a declaimer without energy and of a pedant without learning nor did he find in the contemplative mildness and gentle philosophy of the ancients nothing but a sanction for modern bigotry and existing abuses it was a remarkable trait in his conversation that though he indulged in many references to the old authors and allusions to classic customs he never deviated into the innumerable quotations with which his memory was stored no words in spite of all the quaintness and antiquity of his dialect purely latin or greek ever escaped his lips except in our engagements at capping verses or when he was allured into accepting a challenge of learning from some of its pretenders then indeed he could pour forth such a torrent of authorities as effectually silenced his opponent but these contests were rarely entered into and these triumphs moderately indulged yet he loved the use of quotations in others and i knew the greatest pleasure i could give him was in the frequent use of them perhaps he thought it would seem like an empty parade of learning in one who so confessedly possessed it to deal in the strange words of another tongue and consequently rejected them while with an innocent inconsistency characteristic of the man it never occurred to him that there was any thing either in the quaintness of his dialect or the occupations of his leisure which might subject him to the same imputation of pedantry and yet at times when he warmed in his subject there was a tone in his language as well as sentiment which might not be improperly termed eloquent and the real modesty and quiet enthusiasm of his nature took away from the impression he made the feeling of pomposity and affectation with which otherwise he might have inspired you you have a calm and quiet habitation here said i the very rooks seem to have something lulling in that venerable caw which it always does me such good to hear yes answered clutterbuck i own that there is much that is grateful to the temper of my mind in this retired spot i fancy that i can the better give myself up to the contemplation which makes as it were my intellectual element and food and yet i dare say that in this as in all other things i do strongly err for i remember that during my only sojourn in london i was wont to feel the sound of wheels and of the throng of steps shake the windows of my lodging in the strand as if it were but a warning to recal my mind more closely to its studiesof a verity that noisy evidence of mans labour reminded me how little the great interests of this rolling world were to me and the feeling of solitude amongst the crowds without made me cling more fondly to the company i found within for it seems that the mind is ever addicted to contraries and that when it be transplanted into a soil where all its neighbours do produce a certain fruit it doth from a strange perversity bring forth one of a different sort you would little believe my honoured friend that in this lonely seclusion i cannot at all times prohibit my thoughts from wandering to that gay world of london which during my tarry therein occupied them in so partial a degree you smile my friend nevertheless it is true and when you reflect that i dwelt in the western department of the metropolis near unto the noble mansion of somerset house and consequently in the very centre of what the idle call fashion you will not be so surprised at the occasional migration of my thoughts here the worthy clutterbuck paused and sighed slightly do you farm or cultivate your garden said i they are no ignoble nor unclassical employments unhappily answered clutterbuck i am inclined to neither my chest pains me with a sharp and piercing pang when i attempt to stoop and my respiration is short and asthmatic and in truth i seldom love to stir from my books and papers i go with pliny to his garden and with virgil to his farm those mental excursions are the sole ones i indulge in and when i think of my appetite for application and my love of idleness i am tempted to wax proud of the propensities which reverse the censure of tacitus on our german ancestors and incline so fondly to quiet while they turn so restlessly from sloth here the speaker was interrupted by a long low dry cough which penetrated me to the heart alas thought i as i heard it and looked upon my poor friends hectic and hollow cheek it is not only his mind that will be the victim to the fatality of his studies it was some moments before i renewed the conversation and i had scarcely done so before i was interrupted by the entrance of benjamin jeremiah with a message from his aunt that dinner would be ready in a few minutes another long whisper to christopher succeeded the cidevant fellow of trinity looked down at his garments with a perplexed air i saw at once that he had received a hint on the propriety of a change of raiment to give him due leisure for this i asked the youth to shew me a room in which i might perform the usual ablutions previous to dinner and followed him upstairs to a comfortless sort of dressingroom without a fireplace where i found a yellow were jug and basin and a towel of so coarse a huckaback that i did not dare adventure its rough texture next my complexionmy skin is not made for such rude fellowship while i was tenderly and daintily anointing my hands with some hard water of no blandusian spring and that vile composition entitled windsor soap i heard the difficult breathing of poor clutterbuck on the stairs and soon after he entered the adjacent room two minutes more and his servant joined him for i heard the rough voice of the domestic say there is no more of the wine with the black seal left sir no more good dixon you mistake grievously i had two dozen not a week since dont know im sure sir answered dixon with a careless and half impertinent accent but there are great things like alligators in the cellar which break all the bottles alligators in my cellar said the astonished clutterbuck yes sirat least a venomous sort of reptile like them which the people about here call efts what said clutterbuck innocently and evidently not seeing the irony of his own question what have the efts broken two dozen bottles in a week of an exceeding surety it is strange that a little creature of the lizard species should be so destructiveperchance they have an antipathy to the vinous smell i will confer with my learned friend dr dissectall touching their strength and habits bring up some of the port then good dixon yes sir all the corn is out i had none for the gentlemans horse why dixon my memory fails me strangely or i paid you the sum of four pounds odd shillings for corn on friday last yes sir but your cow and the chickens eat so much and then blind dobbin has four feeds a day and farmer johnson always puts his horse in our stable and mrs clutterbuck and the ladies fed the jackass the other day in the hired donkeychaise besides the rats and mice are always at it it is a marvel unto me answered clutterbuck how detrimental the vermin race are they seem to have noted my poor possessions as their especial prey remind me that i write to dr dissectall tomorrow good dixon yes sir and now i think of it but here mr dixon was cut short in his items by the entrance of a third person who proved to be mrs clutterbuck what not dressed yet mr clutterbuck what a dawdler you areand do lookwas ever woman so used you have wiped your razor upon my nightcapyou dirty slovenly i crave you many pardons i own my error said clutterbuck in a nervous tone of interruption error indeed cried mrs clutterbuck in a sharp overstretched querulous falsetto suited to the occasion but this is always the casei am sure my poor temper is tried to the utmostand lord help thee idiot you have thrust those spindle legs of yours into your coatsleeves instead of your breeches of a truth good wife your eyes are more discerning than mine and my legs which are as you say somewhat thin have indued themselves in what appertaineth not unto them but for all that dorothea i am not deserving of the epithet of idiot with which you have been pleased to favour me although my humble faculties are indeed of no eminent or surpassing order pooh pooh mr clutterbuck i am sure i dont know what else you are muddling your head all day with those goodfornothing books and now do tell me how you could think of asking mr pelham to dinner when you knew we had nothing in the world but hashed mutton and an apple pudding is that the way sir you disgrace your wife after her condescension in marrying you really answered the patient clutterbuck i was forgetful of those matters but my friend cares as little as myself about the grosser tastes of the table and the feast of intellectual converse is all that he desires in his brief sojourn beneath our roof feast of fiddlesticks mr clutterbuck did ever man talk such nonsense </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> nonsense besides rejoined the master of the house unheeding this interruption we have a luxury even of the palate than which there are none more delicate and unto which he as well as myself is i know somewhat unphilosophically given i speak of the oysters sent here by our good friend dr swallowem what do you mean mr clutterbuck my poor mother and i had those oysters last night for our supper i am sure she as well as my sister are almost starved but you are always wanting to be pampered up above us all nay nay answered clutterbuck you know you accuse me wrongfully dorothea but now i think of it would it not be better to modulate the tone of our conversation seeing that our guest a circumstance which until now quite escaped my recollection was shown into the next room for the purpose of washing his hands the which from their notable cleanliness seemed to me wholly unnecessary i would not have him overhear you dorothea lest his kind heart should imagine me less happy thanthan it wishes me good god mr clutterbuck were the only words i heard farther and with tears in my eyes and a suffocating feeling in my throat for the matrimonial situation of my unfortunate friend i descended into the drawingroom the only one yet there was the pale nephew he was bending painfully over a book i took it from him it was bentley upon phalaris i could scarcely refrain from throwing it into the fireanother victim thought ioh the curse of an english education by and by down came the mother and the sister then clutterbuck and lastly bedizened out with gewgaws and trumperythe wife born and nurtured as i was in the art of the volto sciolto pensieri stretti i had seldom found a more arduous task of dissimulation than that which i experienced now however the hope to benefit my friends situation assisted me the best way i thought of obtaining him more respect from his wife would be by showing her the respect he meets with from others accordingly i sat down by her and having first conciliated her attention by some of that coin termed compliments in which there is no counterfeit that does not have the universal effect of real i spoke with the most profound veneration of the talents and learning of clutterbucki dilated upon the high reputation he enjoyedupon the general esteem in which he was heldupon the kindness of his heartthe sincerity of his modestythe integrity of his honourin short whatever i thought likely to affect her most of all i insisted upon the high panegyrics bestowed upon him by lord this and the earl that and wound up with adding that i was certain he would die a bishop my eloquence had its effect all dinner time mrs clutterbuck treated her husband with even striking consideration my words seemed to have gifted her with a new light and to have wrought a thorough transformation in her view of her lord and masters character who knows not the truth that we have dim and shortsighted eyes to estimate the nature of our own kin and that we borrow the spectacles which alone enable us to discern their merits or their failings from the opinion of strangers it may be readily supposed that the dinner did not pass without its share of the ludicrousthat the waiter and the dishes the family and the host would have afforded ample materials no less for the student of nature in hogarth than of caricature in bunbury but i was too seriously occupied in pursuing my object and marking its success to have time even for a smile ah if ever you would allure your son to diplomacy show him how subservient he may make it to benevolence when the women had retired we drew our chairs near to each other and laying down my watch on the table as i looked out upon the declining day i said let us make the best of our time i can only linger here one half hour longer and how my friend said clutterbuck shall we learn the method of making the best use of time there whether it be in the larger segments or the petty subdivisions of our life rests the great enigma of our being who is there that has ever exclaimedpardon my pedantry i am for once driven into greekeuzexa to this most difficult of the sciences come said i it is not for you the favoured scholarthe honoured academicianwhose hours are never idly employed to ask this question your friendship makes too flattering the acumen of your judgment answered the modest clutterbuck it has indeed been my lot to cultivate the fields of truth as transmitted unto our hands by the wise men of old and i have much to be thankful for that i have in the employ been neither curtailed in my leisure nor abased in my independencethe two great goods of a calm and meditative mind yet are there moments in which i am led to doubt of the wisdom of my pursuits and when with a feverish and shaking hand i put aside the books which have detained me from my rest till the morning hour and repair unto a couch often baffled of slumber by the pains and discomforts of this worn and feeble frame i almost wish i could purchase the rude health of the peasant by the exchange of an idle and imperfect learning for the ignorance content with the narrow world it possesses because unconscious of the limitless creation beyond yet my dear and esteemed friend there is a dignified and tranquillizing philosophy in the writings of the ancients which ought to teach me a better condition of mind and when i have risen from the lofty albeit somewhat melancholy strain which swells through the essays of the graceful and tender cicero i have indeed felt a momentary satisfaction at my studies and an elation even at the petty success with which i have cherished them but these are brief and fleeting moments and deserve chastisement for their pride there is one thing my pelham which has grieved me bitterly of late and that is that in the earnest attention which it is theperhaps fastidiouscustom of our university to pay to the minutiae of classic lore i do now oftentimes lose the spirit and beauty of the general bearing nay i derive a far greater pleasure from the ingenious amendment of a perverted text than from all the turn and thought of the sense itself while i am straightening a crooked nail in the winecask i suffer the wine to evaporate but to this i am somewhat reconciled when i reflect that it was also the misfortune of the great porson and the elaborate parr men with whom i blush to find myself included in the same sentence my friend said i i wish neither to wound your modesty nor to impugn your pursuits but think you not that it would be better both for men and for yourself that while you are yet in the vigour of your age and reason you occupy your ingenuity and application in some more useful and lofty work than that which you suffered me to glance at in your library and moreover as the great object of him who would perfect his mind is first to strengthen the faculties of his body would it not be prudent in you to lessen for a time your devotion to books to exercise yourself in the fresh airto relax the bow by loosing the string to mix more with the living and impart to men in conversation as well as in writing whatever the incessant labour of many years may have hoarded come if not to town at least to its vicinity the profits of your living if even tolerably managed will enable you to do so without inconvenience leave your books to their shelves and your flock to their curate andyou shake your headdo i displease you no no my kind and generous adviserbut as the twig was set the tree must grow i have not been without that ambition which however vain and sinful is the first passion to enter the wayward and tossing vessel of our soul and the last to leave its stranded and shattered wreck but mine found and attained its object at an age when in others it is as yet a vague and unsettled feeling and it feeds now rather upon the recollections of what has been than ventures forward on a sea of untried and strange expectation as for my studies how can you who have and in no moderate draught drank of the old stream of castaly how can you ask me now to change them are not the ancients my food my aliment my solace in sorrowmy sympathizers my very benefactors in joy take them away from me and you take away the very winds which purify and give motion to the obscure and silent current of my life besides my pelham it cannot have escaped your observation that there is little in my present state which promises a long increase of days the few that remain to me must glide away like their predecessors and whatever be the infirmities of my body and the little harassments which i am led to suspect do occasionally molest the most fortunate who link themselves unto the unstable and fluctuating part of creation which we term women more especially in an hymeneal capacitywhatever these may be i have my refuge and my comforter in the goldensouled and dreaming plato and the sententious wisdom of the less imaginative seneca nor when i am reminded of my approaching dissolution by the symptoms which do mostly at the midnight hour press themselves upon me is there a small and inglorious pleasure in the hope that i may meet hereafter in those islands of the blest which they dimly dreamt of but which are opened unto my vision without a cloud or mist or shadow of uncertainty and doubt with those bright spirits which we do now converse with so imperfectly that i may catch from the very lips of homer the unclouded </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> unclouded gorgeousness of fiction and from the accents of archimedes the unadulterated calculations of truth clutterbuck ceased and the glow of his enthusiasm diffused itself over his sunken eye and consumptive cheek the boy who had sat apart and silent during our discourse laid his head upon the table and sobbed audibly and i rose deeply affected to offer to one for whom they were indeed unavailing the wishes and blessing of an eager but not hardened disciple of the world we parted on this earth we can never meet again the light has wasted itself away beneath the bushel it will be six weeks tomorrow since the meek and nobleminded academician breathed his last </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxiv tis but a single murderlillo fatal curiosity it was in a melancholy and thoughtful mood that i rode away from the parsonage numerous and hearty were the maledictions i bestowed upon a system of education which while it was so ineffective with the many was so pernicious to the few miserable delusion thought i that encourages the ruin of health and the perversion of intellect by studies that are as unprofitable to the world as they are destructive to the possessorthat incapacitate him for public and unfit him for private lifeand that while they expose him to the ridicule of strangers render him the victim of his wife and the prey of his domestic busied in such reflections i rode quickly on till i found myself once more on the heath i looked anxiously round for the conspicuous equipage of lady chester but in vainthe ground was thinnearly all the higher orders had retiredthe common people grouped together and clamouring noisily were withdrawing and the shrill voices of the itinerant hawkers of cards and bills had at length subsided into silence i rode over the ground in the hope of finding some solitary straggler of our party alas there was not one and with much reluctance at and distaste to my lonely retreat i turned in a homeward direction from the course the evening had already set in but there was a moon in the cold grey sky that i could almost have thanked in a sonnet for a light which i felt was never more welcomely dispensed when i thought of the cross roads and dreary country i had to pass before i reached the longed for haven of chester park after i had left the direct road the wind which had before been piercingly keen fell and i perceived a dark cloud behind which began slowly to overtake my steps i care little in general for the discomfort of a shower yet as when we are in one misfortune we always exaggerate the consequence of a new one i looked upon my dark pursuer with a very impatient and petulant frown and set my horse on a trot much more suitable to my inclination than his own indeed he seemed fully alive to the cornless state of the parsons stable and evinced his sense of the circumstance by a very languid mode of progression and a constant attempt whenever his pace abated and i suffered the rein to slumber upon his neck to crop the rank grass that sprung up on either side of our road i had proceeded about three miles on my way when i heard the clatter of hoofs behind me my even pace soon suffered me to be overtaken and as the stranger checked his horse when he was nearly by my side i turned towards him and beheld sir john tyrrell well said he this is really fortunatefor i began to fear i should have my ride this cold evening entirely to myself i imagined that you had long reached chester park by this time said i did not you leave the course with our party no answered tyrrell i had business at newmarket with a rascally fellow of the name of dawson he lost to me rather a considerable wager and asked me to come to the town with him after the race in order to pay me as he said he lived on the direct road to chester park and would direct and even accompany me through all the difficult part of the ride i the less regretted not joining chester and his party and you know pelham that when pleasure pulls one way and money another it is all over with the first wellto return to my rascalwould you believe that when we got to newmarket he left me at the inn in order he said to fetch the money and after having kept me in a cold room with a smoky chimney for more than an hour without making his appearance i sallied out into the town and found mr dawson quietly seated in a hell with that scoundrel thornton whom i did not conceive till then he was acquainted with it seems that he was to win at hazard sufficient to pay his wager you may fancy my anger and the consequent increase to it when he rose from the table approached me expressed his sorrow dd his ill luck and informed me that he could not pay me for three months you know that i could not ride home with such a fellowhe might have robbed me by the wayso i returned to my inndinedordered my horse set offen cavalier seulinquired my way of every passenger i passed and after innumerable misdirectionshere i am i cannot sympathise with you said i since i am benefitted by your misfortunes but do you think it very necessary to trot so fast i fear my horse can scarcely keep up with yours tyrrell cast an impatient glance at my panting steed it is cursed unlucky you should be so badly mounted and we shall have a pelting shower presently in complaisance to tyrrell i endeavoured to accelerate my steed the roads were rough and stony and i had scarcely got the tired animal into a sharper trot beforewhether or no by some wrench among the deep ruts and flinty causewayhe fell suddenly lame the impetuosity of tyrrell broke out in oaths and we both dismounted to examine the cause of my horses hurt in the hope that it might only be the intrusion of some pebble between the shoe and the hoof while we were yet investigating the cause of our misfortune two men on horseback overtook us tyrrell looked up by heaven said he in a low tone its that dog dawson and his worthy coadjutor tom thornton whats the matter gentlemen cried the bluff voice of the latter can i be of any assistance and without waiting our reply he dismounted and came up to us he had no sooner felt the horses leg than he assured us it was a most severe strain and that the utmost i could effect would be to walk the brute gently home as tyrrell broke out into impatient violence at this speech the sharper looked up at him with an expression of countenance i by no means liked but in a very civil and even respectful tone said if you want sir john to reach chester park sooner than mr pelham can possibly do suppose you ride on with us i will put you in the direct road before i quit you good breeding thought i to propose leaving me to find my own way through this labyrinth of ruts and stones however tyrrell who was in a vile humour in no very courteous manner refused the offer and added that he should continue with me as long as he could and did not doubt that when he left me he should be able to find his own way thornton pressed the invitation still closer and even offered sotto voce to send dawson on before should the baronet object to his company pray sir said tyrrell leave me alone and busy yourself about your own affairs after so tart a reply thornton thought it useless to say more he remounted and with a silent and swaggering nod of familiarity soon rode away with his companion i am sorry said i as we were slowly proceeding that you rejected thorntons offer why to say truth answered tyrrell i have so very bad an opinion of him that i was almost afraid to trust myself in his company on so dreary a road i have nearly and he knows it to the amount of two thousand pounds about me for i was very fortunate in my bettingbook today i know nothing about racing regulations said i but i thought one never paid sums of that amount upon the ground ah answered tyrrell but i won this sum which is l1800 of a country squire from norfolk who said he did not know when he should see me again and insisted on paying me on the spot faith i was not nice in the matter thornton was standing by at the time and i did not half like the turn of his eye when he saw me put it up do you know too continued tyrrell after a pause that i have had a dd fellow dodging me all day and yesterday too wherever i go i am sure to see him he seems constantly though distantly to follow me and what is worse he wraps himself up so well and keeps at so cautious a distance that i can never catch a glimpse of his face i know not why but at that moment the recollection of the muffled figure i had seen upon the course flashed upon me does he wear a long horsemans cloak said i he does answered tyrrell in surprise have you observed him i saw such a person on the race ground replied i but only for an instant farther conversation was suspended by a few heavy drops which fell upon us the cloud had passed over the moon and was hastening rapidly and loweringly over our heads tyrrell was neither of an age a frame nor a temper to be so indifferent to a hearty wetting as myself god he cried you must put on that beast of yoursi cant get wet for all the horses in the world i was not much pleased with </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> with the dictatorial tone of this remark it is impossible said i especially as the horse is not my own and seems considerably lamer than at first but let me not detain you well cried tyrrell in a raised and angry voice which pleased me still less than his former remark but how am i to find my way if i leave you keep straight on said i for a mile farther then a signpost will direct you to the left after a short time you will have a steep hill to descend at the bottom of which is a large pool and a singularly shaped tree then keep straight on till you pass a house belonging to mr dawson come come pelham make haste exclaimed tyrrell impatiently as the rain began now to descend fast and heavy when you have passed that house i resumed coolly rather enjoying his petulance you must bear to the right for six miles and you will be at chester park in less than an hour tyrrell made no reply but put spurs to his horse the pattering rain and the angry heavens soon drowned the last echoes of the receding hoofclang for myself i looked in vain for a tree not even a shrub was to be found the fields lay bare on either side with no other partition but a dead hedge and a deep dyke patientia fit melius thought i as horace said and vincent would say and in order to divert my thoughts from my situation i turned them towards my diplomatic success with lord chester presently for i think scarcely five minutes had elapsed since tyrrells departure a horseman passed me at a sharp pace the moon was hid by the dense cloud and the night though not wholly dark was dim and obscured so that i could only catch the outline of the flitting figure a thrill of fear crept over me when i saw that it was enveloped in a horsemans cloak i soon ralliedthere are more cloaks in the world than one said i to myself besides even if it be tyrrells dodger as he calls him the baronet is better mounted than any highwayman since the days of du val and is moreover strong enough and cunning enough to take admirable care of himself with this reflection i dismissed the occurrence from my thoughts and once more returned to selfcongratulations upon my own incomparable genius i shall now i thought have well earned my seat in parliament dawton will indisputably be if not the prime the principal minister in rank and influence he cannot fail to promote me for his own sake as well as mine and when i have once fairly got my legs in st stephens i shall soon have my hands in office power says some one is a snake that when it once finds a hole into which it can introduce its head soon manages to wriggle in the rest of its body with such meditations i endeavoured to beguile the time and cheat myself into forgetfulness of the lameness of my horse and the dripping wetness of his rider at last the storm began sullenly to subside one impetuous torrent tenfold more violent than those that had preceded it was followed by a momentary stillness which was again broken by a short relapse of a less formidable severity and the moment it ceased the beautiful moon broke out the cloud rolled heavily away and the sky shone forth as fair and smiling as ladyat a ball after she has been beating her husband at home but at that instant or perhaps a second before the storm ceased i thought i heard the sound of a human cry i paused and my heart stood stilli could have heard a gnat hum the sound was not repeated my ear caught nothing but the plashing of the rain drops from the dead hedges and the murmur of the swollen dykes as the waters pent within them rolled hurriedly on by and by an owl came suddenly from behind me and screamed as it flapped across my path that too went rapidly away and with a smile at what i deemed my own fancy i renewed my journey i soon came to the precipitous descent i have before mentioned i dismounted for safety from my drooping and jaded horse and led him down the hill at a distance beyond i saw something dark moving on the grass which bordered the road as i advanced it started forth from the shadow and fled rapidly before me in the moonshineit was a riderless horse a chilling foreboding seized me i looked round for some weapon such as the hedge might afford and finding a strong stick of tolerable weight and thickness i proceeded more cautiously but more fearlessly than before as i wound down the hill the moonlight fell full upon the remarkable and lonely tree i had observed in the morning bare wan and giantlike as it rose amidst the surrounding waste it borrowed even a more startling and ghostly appearance from the cold and lifeless moonbeams which fell around and upon it like a shroud the retreating animal i had driven before me paused by this tree i hastened my steps as if by an involuntary impulse as well as the enfeebled animal i was leading would allow me and discovered a horseman galloping across the waste at full speed the ground over which he passed was steeped in the moonshine and i saw the long and disguising cloak in which he was developed as clearly as by the light of day i paused and as i was following him with my looks my eye fell upon some obscure object by the left side of the pool i threw my horses rein over the hedge and firmly grasping my stick hastened to the spot as i approached the object i perceived that it was a human figure it was lying still and motionless the limbs were half immersed in the waterthe face was turned upwardsthe side and throat were wet with a deep red stainit was of blood the thin dark hairs of the head were clotted together over a frightful and disfiguring contusion i bent over the face in a shuddering and freezing silence it was the countenance of sir john tyrrell </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxv marry he was deadand the right valiant barlquo walked too late whom you may say if it please you fleance killed for fleance fled macbeth it is a fearful thing even to the hardiest nerves to find ourselves suddenly alone with the dead how much more so if we have but a breathing interval before moved and conversed with the warm and living likeness of the motionless clay before us and this was the man from whom i had parted in coldnessalmost in angerat a worda breath i took up the heavy handit fell from my grasp and as it did so i thought a change passed over the livid countenance i was deceived it was but a light cloud flitting over the moonit rolled away and the placid and guiltless light shone over that scene of dread and blood making more wild and chilling the eternal contrast of earth and heavenman and his makerpassion and immutabilitydust and immortality but that was not a moment for reflectiona thousand thoughts hurried upon me and departed as swift and confusedly as they came my mind seemed a jarring and benighted chaos of the faculties which were its elements and i had stood several minutes over the corpse before by a vigorous effort i shook off the stupor that possessed me and began to think of the course that it now behoved me to pursue the house i had noted in the morning was i knew within a few minutes walk of the spot but it belonged to dawson upon whom the first weight of my suspicions rested i called to mind the disreputable character of that man and the still more daring and hardened one of his companion thornton i remembered the reluctance of the deceased to accompany them and the wellgrounded reason he assigned and my suspicions amounting to certainty i resolved rather to proceed to chester park and there give the alarm than to run the unnecessary risk of interrupting the murderers in the very lair of their retreat and yet thought i as i turned slowly away how if they were the villains is the appearance and flight of the disguised horseman to be accounted for then flashed upon my recollection all that tyrrell had said of the dogged pursuit of that mysterious person and the circumstance of his having passed me upon the road so immediately after tyrrell had quitted me these reflections associated with a name i did not dare breathe even to myself although i could not suppress a suspicion which accounted at once for the pursuit and even for the deed made me waver in and almost renounce my former condemnation of thornton and his friend and by the time i reached the white gate and dwarfish avenue which led to dawsons house i resolved at all events to halt at the solitary mansion and mark the effect my information would cause a momentary fear for my own safety came across me but was as instantly dismissedfor even supposing the friends were guilty still it would be no object to them to extend their remorseless villany to me and i knew that i could sufficiently command my own thoughts to prevent any suspicion i might form from mounting to my countenance or discovering itself in my manner there was a light in the upper story it burned still and motionless how holy seemed the tranquillity of life to the forced and fearful silence of the death scene i had just witnessed i rung twice at the doorno one came to answer my summons but the light in the upper window moved hurriedly to and fro they are coming said i to myself no such thingthe casement above was openedi looked up and discovered to my infinite comfort and delight a blunderbuss protruded eight inches out of the window in a direct line with my head i receded close to </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> to the wall with no common precipitation get away you rascal said a gruff but trembling voice or ill blow your brains out my good sir i replied still keeping my situation i come on urgent business either to mr thornton or mr dawson and you had better therefore if the delay is not very inconvenient defer the honour you offer me till i have delivered my message master and squire thornton are not returned from newmarket and we cannot let any one in till they come home replied the voice in a tone somewhat mollified by my rational remonstrance and while i was deliberating what rejoinder to make a rough red head like listons in a farce poked itself cautiously out under cover of the blunderbuss and seemed to reconnoitre my horse and myself presently another head but attired in the more civilized gear of a cap and flowers peeped over the first persons left shoulder the view appeared to reassure them sir said the female my husband and mr thornton are not returned and we have been so much alarmed of late by an attack on the house that i cannot admit any one till their return madam i replied reverently doffing my hat i do not like to alarm you by mentioning the information i should have given to mr dawson only oblige me by telling them on their return to look beside the pool on the common they will then do as best pleases them upon this speech which certainly was of no agreeable tendency the blunderbuss palpitated so violently that i thought it highly imprudent to tarry any longer in so immediate a vicinity accordingly i made the best of my way out of the avenue and once more resumed my road to chester park i arrived there at length the gentlemen were still in the diningroom i sent out for lord chester and communicated the scene i had witnessed and the cause of my delay what brown bob lamed said he and tyrrellpoorpoor fellow how shocking we must send instantly here john tom wilson and his lordship shouted and rung the bell in an indescribable agitation the under butler appeared and lord chester beganmy head groomsir john tyrrell is murderedviolent sprain in off legsend lights with mr pelhampoor gentlemanan express instantly to dr physiconmr pelham will tell you allbrown bobhis throat cut from ear to earwhat shall be done and with this coherent and explanatory harangue the marquis sunk down in his chair in a sort of hysteria the under butler looked at him in suspicious bewilderment come said i i will explain what his lordship means and taking the man out of the room i gave him in brief the necessary particulars i ordered a fresh horse for myself and four horsemen to accompany me while these were preparing the news was rapidly spreading and i was soon surrounded by the whole house many of the men wished to accompany me and lord chester who had at last recovered from his stupor insisted upon heading the search we set off to the number of fourteen and soon arrived at dawsons house the light in the upper room was still burning we rang and after a brief pause thornton himself opened the door to us he looked pale and agitated how shocking he said directlywe are only just returned from the spot accompany us mr thornton said i sternly and fixing my eye upon him certainly was his immediate answer without testifying any confusioni will fetch my hat he went into the house for a moment do you suspect these people whispered lord chester not suspect said i but doubt we proceeded down the avenue where is mr dawson said i to thornton oh within answered thornton shall i fetch him do was my brief reply thornton was absent some minutes when he reappeared dawson was following him poor fellow said he to me in a low tonehe was so shocked by the sight that he is still all in a panic besides as you will see he is half drunk still i made no answer but looked narrowly at dawson he was evidently as thornton said greatly intoxicated his eyes swam and his feet staggered as he approached us yet through all the natural effects of drunkenness he seemed nervous and frightened this however might be the natural and consequently innocent effect of the mere sight of an object so full of horror and accordingly i laid little stress upon it we reached the fatal spot the body seemed perfectly unmoved why said i apart to thornton while all the rest were crowding fearfully round the corpsewhy did you not take the body within i was going to return here with our servant for that purpose answered the gambler for poor dawson was both too drunk and too nervous to give me any assistance and how came it i rejoined eyeing him searchingly that you and your friend had not returned home when i called there although you had both long since passed me on the road and i had never overtaken you thornton without any hesitation repliedbecause during the violence of the shower we cut across the fields to an old shed which we recollected and we remained there till the rain had ceased they are probably innocent thought iand i turned to look once more at the body which our companions had now raised there was upon the head a strong contusion as if inflicted by some blunt and heavy instrument the fingers of the right hand were deeply gashed and one of them almost dissevered the unfortunate man had in all probability grasped the sharp weapon from which his other wounds proceeded these were one wide cut along the throat and another in the side either of them would have occasioned his death in loosening the clothes another wound was discovered but apparently of a less fatal nature and in lifting the body the broken blade of a long sharp instrument like a caseknife was discovered it was the opinion of the surgeon who afterwards examined the body that the blade had been broken by coming in contact with one of the rib bones and it was by this that he accounted for the slightness of the last mentioned wound i looked carefully among the fern and long grass to see if i could discover any other token of the murderer thornton assisted me at the distance of some feet from the body i thought i perceived something glitter i hastened to the place and picked up a miniature i was just going to cry out when thornton whisperedhush i know the picture it is as i suspected an icy thrill ran through my very heart with a desperate but trembling hand i cleansed from the picture the blood in which notwithstanding its distance from the corpse the grater part of it was bathed i looked upon the features they were those of a young and singularly beautiful female i recognized them not i turned to the other side of the miniature upon it were braided two locks of hairone was the long dark ringlet of a woman the other was of a light auburn beneath were four letters i looked eagerly at them my eyes are dim said i in a low tone to thornton i cannot trace the initials but i can replied he in the same whispered key but with a savage exultation which made my heart stand stillthey are g d r g they are the initials of gertrude douglas and reginald glanville i looked up at the speakerour eyes meti grasped his hand vehemently he understood me put it up said he we will keep the secret all this so long in the recital passed in the rapidity of a moment have you found any thing there pelham shouted one of our companions no cried i thrusting the miniature in my bosom and turning unconcernedly away we carried the corpse to dawsons house the poor wife was in fits we heard her scream as we laid the body upon a table in the parlour what more can be done said lord chester nothing was the general answer no excitation makes the english people insensible to the chance of catching cold let us go home then and send to the nearest magistrate exclaimed our host and this proposal required no repetition on our way chester said to me that fellow dawson looked devilish uneasydont you still suspect him and his friend i do not answered i emphatically </chapter> </volume>

<chapter>chapter lxvi and now im the world alone but why for others should i groan when none will sigh for mebyron the whole country was in confusion at the news of the murder all the myrmidons of justice were employed in the most active research for the murderers some few persons were taken up on suspicion but were as instantly discharged thornton and dawson underwent a long and rigorous examination but no single tittle of evidence against them appeared they were consequently dismissed the only suspicious circumstance against them was their delay on the road but the cause given the same as thornton had at first assigned to me was probable and natural the shed was indicated and as if to confirm thorntons account a glove belonging to that person was found there to crown all my own evidence in which i was constrained to mention the circumstance of the muffled horseman having passed me on the road and being found by me on the spot itself threw the whole weight of suspicion upon that man whoever he might be all attempts however to discover him were in vain it was ascertained that a man muffled in a cloak was seen at newmarket but not remarkably observed it was also discovered that a person so habited had put up a grey horse to bait in one of the inns at newmarket but in the throng of strangers neither the horse nor its owner had drawn down any particular remark on further inquiry testimony differed four or five men in cloaks had left their horses at the stables one ostler changed the colour of the steed to brown a second to black a </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> a third deposed that the gentleman was remarkably tall and the waite swore solemnly he had given a glass of brandy and water to an unked looking gentleman in a cloak who was remarkably short in fine no material point could be proved and though the officers were still employed in active search they could trace nothing that promised a speedy discovery as for myself as soon as i decently could i left chester park with a most satisfactory dispatch in my pocket from its possessor to lord dawton and found myself once more on the road to london alas how different were my thoughts how changed the temper of my mind since i had last travelled that road then i was full of hope energy ambitionof interest for reginald glanvilleof adoration for his sister and now i leaned back listless and dispirited without a single feeling to gladden the restless and feverish despair which ever since that night had possessed me what was ambition henceforth to me the most selfish amongst us must have some human being to whom to referwith whom to connectto associateto treasure the triumphs and gratifications of self where now was such a being to me my earliest friend for whom my esteem was the greater for his sorrows my interest the keener for his mystery reginald glanville was a murderer a dastardly a barbarous felon whom the chance of an instant might convictand sheshe the only woman in the world i had ever really lovedwho had ever pierced the thousand folds of my ambitious and scheming heartshe was the sister of the assassin then came over my mind the savage and exulting eye of thornton when it read the damning record of glanvilles guilt and in spite of my horror at the crime of my former friend i trembled for his safety nor was i satisfied with myself at my prevarication as a witness it is true that i had told the truth but i had concealed all the truth and my heart swelled proudly and bitterly against the miniature which i still concealed in my bosom light as i may seem to the reader bent upon the pleasures and the honours of the great world as i really was there had never since i had recognized and formed a decided code of principles been a single moment in which i had transgressed it and perhaps i was sterner and more inflexible in the tenets of my morality such as they were than even the most zealous worshipper of the letter as well as the spirit of the law and the prophets would require certainly there were many pangs within me when i reflected that to save a criminal in whose safety i was selfishly concerned i had tampered with my honour paltered with the truth and broken what i felt to be a peremptory and inviolable duty let it be for ever remembered that once acknowledge and ascertain that a principle is publicly good and no possible private motive should ever induce you to depart from it it was with a heightened pulse and a burning cheek that i entered london before midnight i was in a high fever they sent for the vultures of physici was bled copiouslyi was kept quiet in bed for six days at the end of that time my constitution and youth restored me i took up one of the newspapers listlessly glanvilles name struck me i read the paragraph which contained itit was a highflown and fustian panegyric on his genius and promise i turned to another column it contained a long speech he had the night before made in the house of commons can such things be thought i yea and thereby hangs a secret and an anomaly in the human heart a man may commit the greatest of crimes and if no other succeed to it it changes not the current of his beingto all the worldto all intentsfor all objects he may be the same he may equally serve his countryequally benefit his friendsbe generousbravebenevolent all that he was before one crime however heinous makes no revolution in the systemit is only the perpetual course of sins vices follies however insignificant they may seem which alters the nature and hardens the heart my mother was out of town when i returned there they had written to her during my illness and while i was yet musing over the days journal a letter from her was put into my hand i transcribe it my dearest henry how dreadfully uneasy i am about you write to me directly i would come to town myself but am staying with dear lady dawton who wont hear of my going and i cannot offend her for your sake by the by why have you not called upon lord dawton but i forgot you have been ill my dear dear child i am wretched about you and now pale your illness will make you look just too as the best part of the season is coming on how unlucky pray dont wear a black cravat when you next call on lady roseville but choose a very fine baptiste oneit will make you look rather delicate than ill what physician do you have i hope in god that it is sir henry halford i shall be too miserable if it is not i am sure no one can conceive the anguish i suffer your father too poor man has been laid up with the gout for the last three days keep up your spirits my dearest child and get some light books to entertain you but pray as soon as you are well do go to lord dawtonshe is dying to see you but be sure not to catch cold how did you like lady chester pray take the greatest care of yourself and write soon to your wretched and most affectionate mother f p ps how dreadfully shocking about that poor sir john tyrrell i tossed the letter from me heaven pardon me if the misanthropy of my mood made me less grateful for the maternal solicitude than i should otherwise have been i took up one of the numerous books with which my table was covered it was a worldly work of one of the french reasoners it gave a new turn to my thoughtsmy mind reverted to its former projects of ambition who does not know what active citizens private misfortune makes us the public is like the pools of bethesdawe all hasten there to plunge in and rid ourselves of our afflictions i drew my portfeuille to me and wrote to lord dawton three hours after i had sent the note he called upon me i gave him lord chesters letter but he had already received from that nobleman a notification of my success he was profuse in his compliments and thanks and do you know added the statesman that you have quite made a conquest of lord guloseton he speaks of you publicly in the highest terms i wish we could get him and his votes we must be strengthened my dear pelham every thing depends on the crisis are you certain of the cabinet i asked yes it is not yet publicly announced but it is fully known amongst us who comes in and who stays out i am to have the place of i congratulate your lordship from my heart what post do you design for me lord dawton changed countenance whyreallypelham we have not yet filled up the lesser appointments but you shall be well rememberedwell my dear pelham be sure of it i looked at the noble speaker with a glance which i flatter myself is peculiar to me if thought i the embryo minister is playing upon me as upon one of his dependant characters if he dares forget what he owes to my birth and zeal i will grind myself to powder but i will shake him out of his seat the anger of the moment passed away lord dawton said i one word and i have done discussing my claims for the present do you mean to place me in parliament as soon as you are in the cabinet what else you intend for me i question not yes assuredly pelham how can you doubt it enoughand now read this letter from france two days after my interview with lord dawton as i was riding leisurely through the green park in no very bright and social mood one of the favoured carriages whose owners are permitted to say hic iter est nobis overtook me a sweet voice ordered the coachman to stop and then addressed itself to me what the hero of chester park returned without having once narrated his adventures tome beautiful lady roseville said i i plead guilty of negligencenot treason i forgot it is true to appear before you but i forget not the devotion of my duty now that i behold you command and i obey see ellen said lady roseville turning to a bending and blushing countenance beside her which i then first perceivedsee what it is to be a knight errant even his language is worthy of amadis of gaulbutagain addressing me your adventures are really too shocking a subject to treat lightly we lay our serious orders on you to come to our castle this night we shall be alone willingly shall i repair to your bower fayre ladie but tell me i beseech you how many persons are signified in the world alone why answered lady roseville i fear we may have two or three people with us but i think ellen we may promise our chevalier that the number shall not exceed twelve i bowed and rode on what worlds would i not have given to have touched the hand of the countesss companion though only for an instant butand that fearful but chilled me like an icebolt i put spurs to my horse and dashed fiercely onwards there was rather a high wind stirring and i bent my face from it so as scarcely to see the course of my spirited and impatient horse what ho sirwhat ho cried a shrill voicefor gods sake dont ride over me before dinner whatever you do after </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> after it i pulled up ah lord guloseton how happy i am to see you pray forgive my blindness and my horses stupidity tis an ill wind answered the noble gourmand which blows nobody good an excellent proverb the veracity of which is daily attested for however unpleasant a keen wind may be there is no doubt of its being a marvellous whetter of that greatest of heavens blessingsan appetite little however did i expect that besides blowing me a relish for my saute de foie gras it would also blow me one who might probably be a partaker of my enjoyment honour me with your company at dinner today what saloon will you dine in my lord lucullus said i in allusion to the custom of the epicure by whose name i addressed him the saloon of diana replied gulosetonfor she must certainly have shot the fine buck of which lord h sent me the haunch that we shall have today it is the true old meynell breed i ask you not to meet mr soandso and lord whatdyecallhim i ask you to meet a saute de foie gras and a haunch of venison i will most certainly pay them my respects never did i know before how far things were better company than persons your lordship has taught me that great truth god bless me cried guloseton with an air of vexation here comes the duke of stilton a horrid person who told me the other day at my petit diner when i apologized to him for some strange error of my artistes by which common vinegar had been substituted for chiliwho told mewhat think you he told me you cannot guess he told me forsooth that he did not care what he eat and for his part he could make a very good dinner off a beefsteak why the deuce then did he come and dine with me could he have said any thing more cutting imagine my indignation when i looked round my table and saw so many good things thrown away upon such an idiot scarcely was the last word out of the gourmands mouth before the noble personage so designated joined us it amused me to see gulosetons contempt which he scarcely took the pains to suppress of a person whom all europe honoured and his evident weariness of a companion whose society every one else would have coveted as the summum bonum of worldly distinction as for me feeling any thing but social i soon left the illmatched pair and rode into the other park just as i entered it i perceived on a dull yet crosslooking pony mr wormwood of bitter memory although we had not met since our mutual sojourn at sir lionel garratts and were then upon very cool terms of acquaintance he seemed resolved to recognize and claim me my dear sir said he with a ghastly smile i am rejoiced once more to see you bless me how pale you look i heard you had been very ill pray have you been yet to that man who professes to cure consumption in the worst stages yes said i he read me two or three letters of reference from the patients he had cured his last he said was a gentleman very far gone a mr wormwood oh you are pleased to be facetious said the cynic coldlybut pray do tell me about that horrid affair at chester park how disagreeable it must have been to you to be taken up on suspicion of the murder sir said i haughtily what do you mean oh you were notwernt you well i always thought it unlikely but every one says so my dear sir i rejoined how long is it since you have minded what every body says if i were so foolish i should not be riding with you now but i have always said in contradiction to every body and even in spite of being universally laughed at for my singular opinion that you my dear mr wormwood were by no means silly nor ignorant nor insolent nor intrusive that you were on the contrary a very decent author and a very good sort of man and that you were so benevolent that you daily granted to some one or other the greatest happiness in your power it is a happiness i am now about to enjoy and it consists in wishing you good bye and without waiting for mr wormwoods answer i gave the rein to my horse and was soon lost among the crowd which had now began to assemble hyde park is a stupid place the english make business an enjoyment and enjoyment a businessthey are born without a smilethey rove about public places like so many easterly windscold sharp and cutting or like a group of fogs on a frosty day sent out of his hall by boreas for the express purpose of looking black at one another when they ask you how you do you would think they were measuring the length of your coffin they are ever it is true labouring to be agreeable but they are like sisyphus the stone they roll up the hill with so much toil runs down again and hits you a thump on the legs they are sometimes polite but invariably uncivil their warmth is always artificialtheir cold never they are stiff without dignity and cringing without manners they offer you an affront and call it plain truth they wound your feelings and tell you it is manly to speak their minds at the same time while they have neglected all the graces and charities of artifice they have adopted all its falsehood and deceit while they profess to abhor servility they adulate the peeragewhile they tell you they care not a rush for the minister they move heaven and earth for an invitation from the ministers wife there is not another court in europe where such systematized meanness is carried onwhere they will even believe you when you assert that it exists abroad you can smile at the vanity of one class and the flattery of another the first is too well bred to affront the latter too graceful to disgust but here the pride of a noblesse by the way the most mushroom in europe knocks you down in a hailstorm and the fawning of the bourgeois makes you sick with hot water then their amusementsthe heatthe dustthe

<chapter>chapter lxvii in solo vivendi causa palato estjuvenal they would talk of nothing but high life and highlived company with other fashionable topics such as pictures taste shakspeare and the musical glassesvicar of wakefield the reflections which closed the last chapter will serve to show that i was in no very amiable or convivial temper when i drove to lord gulosetons dinner however in the world it matters little what may be our real mood the mask hides the bent brow and the writhing lip guloseton was stretched on his sofa gazing with upward eye at the beautiful venus which hung above his hearth you are welcome pelham i am worshipping my household divinity i prostrated myself on the opposite sofa and made some answer to the classical epicure which made us both laugh heartily we then talked of pictures painters poets the ancients and dr henderson on wines we gave ourselves up without restraint to the enchanting fascination of the lastnamed subject and our mutual enthusiasm confirming our cordiality we went down stairs to our dinner as charmed with each other as boon companions always should be this is comme il faut said i looking round at the well filled table and the sparkling spirits immersed in the icepails a genuine friendly dinner it is very rarely that i dare entrust myself to such extempore hospitalitymiserum est aliena vivere quadraa friendly dinner a family meal are things from which i fly with undisguised aversion it is very hard that in england one cannot have a friend on pain of being shot or poisoned if you refuse his familiar invitations he thinks you mean to affront him and says something rude for which you are forced to challenge him if you accept them you perish beneath the weight of boiled mutton and turnips or my dear friend interrupted guloseton with his mouth full it is very true but this is no time for talking let us eat i acknowledged the justice of the rebuke and we did not interchange another word beyond the exclamations of surprise pleasure admiration or dissatisfaction called up by the objects which engrossed our attention till we found ourselves alone with our dessert when i thought my host had imbibed a sufficient quantity of wine i once more renewed my attack i had tried him before upon that point of vanity which is centered in power and political consideration but in vain i now bethought me of another how few persons there are said i capable of giving even a tolerable dinnerhow many capable of admiring one worthy of estimation i could imagine no greater triumph for the ambitious epicure than to see at his board the first and most honoured persons of the state all lost in wonder at the depth the variety the purity the munificence of his taste all forgetting in the extorted respect which a gratified palate never fails to produce the more visionary schemes and projects which usually occupy their thoughtsto find those whom all england are soliciting for posts and power become in their turn eager and craving aspirants for placesat his tableto know that all the grand movements of the ministerial body are planned and agitated over the inspirations of his viands and the excitement of his winefrom a haunch of venison like the one of which we have partaken today what noble and substantial measures might arise from a saute </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> saute de foie what delicate subtleties of finesse might have their origin from a ragout a la financiere what godlike improvements in taxation oh could such a lot be mine i would envy neither napoleon for the goodness of his fortune nor sfor the grandeur of his genius guloseton laughed the ardour of your enthusiasm blinds your philosophy my dear pelham like montesquieu the liveliness of your fancy often makes you advance paradoxes which the consideration of your judgment would afterwards condemn for instance you must allow that if one had all those fine persons at ones table one would be forced to talk more and consequently to eat less moreover you would either be excited by your triumph or you would not that is indisputable if you are not excited you have the bore for nothing if you are excited you spoil your digestion nothing is so detrimental to the stomach as the feverish inquietude of the passions all philosophies recommend calm as the to kalon of their code and you must perceive that if in the course you advise one has occasional opportunities of pride one also has those of mortification mortification terrible word how many apoplexies have arisen from its source no pelham away with ambition fill your glass and learn at last the secret of real philosophy confound the man was my mental anathemalong life to the solomon of sautes was my audible exclamation there is something resumed guloseton in your countenance and manner at once so frank lively and ingenuous that one is not only prepossessed in your favour but desirous of your friendship i tell you therefore in confidence that nothing more amuses me than to see the courtship i receive from each party i laugh at all the unwise and passionate contests in which others are engaged and i would as soon think of entering into the chivalry of don quixote or attacking the visionary enemies of the bedlamite as of taking part in the fury of politicians at present looking afar off at their delirium i can ridicule it were i to engage in it i should be hurt by it i have no wish to become the weeping instead of the laughing philosopher i sleep well nowi have no desire to sleep ill i eat wellwhy should i lose my appetite i am undisturbed and unattacked in the enjoyments best suited to my tastefor what purpose should i be hurried into the abuse of the journalists and the witticisms of pamphleteers i can ask those whom i like to my housewhy should i be forced into asking those whom i do not like in fine my good pelham why should i sour my temper and shorten my life put my green old age into flannel and physic and become from the happiest of sages the most miserable of fools ambition reminds me of what bacon says of angerit is like rain it breaks itself upon that which it falls on pelham my boy taste the chateau margot however hurt my vanity might be in having so ill succeeded in my object i could not help smiling with satisfaction at my entertainers principles of wisdom my diplomatic honour however was concerned and i resolved yet to gain him if hereafter i succeeded it was by a very different method than i had yet taken meanwhile i departed from the house of this modern apicius with a new insight into the great book of mankind and a new conclusion from its pages viz that no virtue can make so perfect a philosopher as the senses there is no content like that of the epicureno active code of morals so difficult to conquer as the inertness of his indolence he is the only being in the world for whom the present has a supremer gratification than the future my cabriolet soon whirled me to lady rosevilles door the first person i saw in the drawingroom was ellen she lifted up her eyes with that familiar sweetness with which they had long since began to welcome me her brother may perish on the gibbet was the thought that curdled my blood and i bowed distantly and passed on i met vincent he seemed dispirited and dejected he already saw how ill his party had succeeded above all he was enraged at the idea of the person assigned by rumour to fill the place he had intended for himself this person was a sort of rival to his lordship a man of quaintness and quotation with as much learning as vincent equal wit andbut that personage is still in office and i will say no more lest he should think i flatter to our subject it has probably been observed that lord vincent had indulged less of late in that peculiar strain of learned humour formerly his wont the fact is that he had been playing another part he wished to remove from his character that appearance of literary coxcombry with which he was accused he knew well how necessary in the game of politics it is to appear no less a man of the world than of books and though he was not averse to display his clerkship and scholastic information yet he endeavoured to make them seem rather valuable for their weight than curious for their fashion how few there are in the world who retain after a certain age the character originally natural to them we all get as it were a second skin the little foibles propensities eccentricities we first indulged through affectation conglomerate and encrust till the artificiality grows into nature pelham said vincent with a cold smile the day will be yours the battle is not to the strongthe whigs will triumph fugere pudor verumque fidesque in quorum subiere locum fraudesque dolique insidioeque et vis et amor sceleratus habendi a pretty modest quotation said i you must allow at least that the amor sceleratus habendi was also in some moderate degree shared by the pudor and fides which characterize your party otherwise i am at a loss how to account for the tough struggle against us we have lately had the honour of resisting never mind replied vincent i will not refute you la richesse permet une juste fierte mais il faut etre souple avec la pauvrete it is not for us the defeated to argue with you the victors but pray continued vincent with a sneer which pleased me not pray among this windfall of the hesperian fruit what nice little apple will fall to your share my good vincent dont let us anticipate if any such apple should come into my lap let it not be that of discord between us who talks of discord asked lady roseville joining us lord vincent said i fancies himself the celebrated fruit on which was written detur pulcerrimoe to be given to the fairest suffer me therefore to make him a present to your ladyship vincent muttered something which as i really liked and esteemed him i was resolved not to hear accordingly i turned to another part of the room there i found lady dawtonshe was a tall handsome woman as proud as a liberals wife ought to be she received me with unusual graciousness and i sat myself beside her three dowagers and an old beau of the old school were already sharing the conversation with the haughty countess i found that the topic was society no said the old beau who was entitled mr clarendon society is very different from what it was in my younger days you remember lady paulet those delightful parties at dhouse where shall we ever find any thing like them such ease such companyeven the mixture was so piquant if one chanced to sit next a bourgeois he was sure to be distinguished for his wit or talent people were not tolerated as now merely for their riches true cried lady dawton it is the introduction of low persons without any single pretension which spoils the society of the present day and the three dowagers sighed amen to this remark and yet said i since i may safely say so here without being suspected of a personality in the shape of a compliment dont you think that without any such mixture we should be very indifferent company do we not find those dinners and soirees the pleasantest where we see a minister next to a punster a poet to a prince and a coxcomb like me next to a beauty like lady dawton the more variety there is in the conversation the more agreeable it becomes very just answered mr clarendon but it is precisely because i wish for that variety that i dislike a miscellaneous society if one does not know the person beside whom one has the happiness of sitting what possible subject can one broach with any prudence i put politics aside because thanks to party spirit we rarely meet those we are strongly opposed to but if we sneer at the methodists our neighbour may be a saintif we abuse a new book he may have written itif we observe that the tone of the pianoforte is bad his father may have made itif we complain of the uncertainty of the banking interest his uncle may have been gazetted last week i name no exaggerated instances on the contrary i refer these general remarks to particular individuals whom all of us have probably met thus you see that a variety of topics is prescribed in a mixed company because some one or other of them will be certain to offend perceiving that we listened to him with attention mr clarendon continuednor is this more than a minor objection to the great mixture prevalent amongst us a more important one may be found in the universal imitation it produces the influx of common persons being once permitted certain sets recede as it were from the contamination and contract into very diminished coteries living familiarly solely amongst themselves however they may be forced into visiting promiscuously they imbibe certain manners certain peculiarities in mode and wordseven in an accent or a pronunciation which are confined to themselves and whatever differs from these little eccentricities they are apt to condemn as vulgar and suburban now the fastidiousness </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> fastidiousness of these sets making them difficult of intimate access even to many of their superiors in actual rank those very superiors by a natural feeling in human nature of prizing what is rare even if it is worthless are the first to solicit their acquaintance and as a sign that they enjoy it to imitate those peculiarities which are the especial hieroglyphics of this sacred few the lower grades catch the contagion and imitate those they imagine most likely to know the proprietes of the mode and thus manners unnatural to all are transmitted secondhand thirdhand fourthhand till they are ultimately filtered into something worse than no manners at all hence you perceive all people timid stiff unnatural and ill at ease they are dressed up in a garb which does not fit them to which they have never been accustomed and are as little at home as the wild indian in the boots and garments of the more civilized european and hence said i springs that universal vulgarity of idea as well as manner which pervades all societyfor nothing is so plebeian as imitation a very evident truism said clarendonwhat i lament most is the injudicious method certain persons took to change this order of things and diminish the desagremens of the mixture we speak of i remember well when almacks was first set up the intention was to keep away the rich roturiers from a place the tone of which was also intended to be contrary to their own for this purpose the patronesses were instituted the price of admission made extremely low and all ostentatious refreshments discarded it was an admirable institution for the interests of the little oligarchy who ruled itbut it has only increased the general imitation and vulgarity perhaps the records of that institution contain things more disgraceful to the aristocracy of england than the whole history of europe can furnish and how could the monsieur and madame jourdains help following the servile and debasing example of monseigneur le duc et pair how strange it is said one of the dowagers that of all the novels on society with which we are annually inundated there is scarcely one which gives even a tolerable description of it not strange said clarendon with a formal smile if your ladyship will condescend to reflect most of the writers upon our little great world have seen nothing of it at most they have been occasionally admitted into the routs of the bs and cs of the second or rather the third set a very few are it is true gentlemen but gentlemen who are not writers are as bad as writers who are not gentlemen in one work which since it is popular i will not name there is a stiffness and stiltedness in the dialogue and descriptions perfectedly ridiculous the author makes his countesses always talking of their family and his earls always quoting the peerage there is as much fuss about state and dignity and pride as if the greatest amongst us were not far too busy with the petty affairs of the world to have time for such lofty vanities there is only one rule necessary for a clever writer who wishes to delineate the beau monde it is this let him consider that dukes and lords and noble princes eat drink talk move exactly the same as any other class of civilized peoplenay the very subjects in conversation are for the most part the same in all setsonly perhaps they are somewhat more familiarly and easily treated than among the lower orders who fancy rank is distinguished by pomposity and that state affairs are discussed with the solemnity of a tragedythat we are always my lording and my ladying each otherthat we ridicule commoners and curl our hair with debretts peerage we all laughed at this speech the truth of which we readily acknowledged nothing said lady dawton amuses me more than to see the great distinction novel writers make between the titled and the untitled they seem to be perfectly unaware that a commoner of ancient family and large fortune is very often of far more real rank and estimation and even weight in what they are pleased to term fashion than many of the members of the upper house and what amuses me as much is the no distinction they make between all people who have titleslord a the little baron is exactly the same as lord z the great marquess equally haughty and equally important mais mon dieu said a little french count who had just joined us how is it that you can expect to find a description of society entertaining when the society itself is so dullthe closer the copy the more tiresome it must be your manner pour vous amuser consists in standing on a crowded staircase and complaining that you are terribly bored lon saccoutume difficilement a une vie qui se passe sur lescalier it is very true said clarendon we cannot defend ourselves we are a very sensible thinking brave sagacious generous industrious nobleminded people but it must be confessed that we are terrible bores to ourselves and all the rest of the world lady paulet if you are going so soon honour me by accepting my arm you should say your hand said the frenchman pardon me answered the gallant old beau i say with your brave countryman when he lost his legs in battle and was asked by a lady like the one who now leans on me whether he would not sooner have lost his arms no madam said he and this monsieur le comte is the answer i give to your rebuke i want my hands to guard my heart finding our little knot was now broken up i went into another part of the room and joined vincent lady roseville ellen and one or two other persons who were assembled round a table covered with books and prints ellen was sitting on one side of lady roseville there was a vacant chair next her but i avoided it and seated myself on the other side of lady roseville pray miss glanville said lord vincent taking up a thin volume do you greatly admire the poems of this lady what mrs hemans answered ellen i am more enchanted with her poetry than i can express if that is the forest sanctuary which you have taken up i am sure you will bear me out in my admiration vincent turned over the leaves with the quiet cynicism of manner habitual to him but his countenance grew animated after he had read two pages this is indeed beautiful said he really and genuinely beautiful how singular that such a work should not be more known i never met with it before but whose pencil marks are these mine i believe said ellen modestly well said lady roseville i fear we shall never have any popular poet in our time now that lord byron is dead so the booksellers say replied vincent but i doubt it there will be always a certain interregnum after the death of a great poet during which poetry will be received with distaste and chiefly for this reason that nearly all poetry about the same period will be of the same school as the most popular author now the public soon wearies of this monotony and no poetry even equally beautiful with that of the most approved writer will become popular unless it has the charm of variety it must not be perfect in the old school it must be daring in a new oneit must effect a through revolution in taste and build itself a temple out of the ruins of the old worship all this a great genius may do if he will take the pains to alter radically the style he may have formed already he must stoop to the apprenticeship before he aspires to the mastery cest un metier que de faire un livre comme de faire une pendule i must confess for my part said lord edward neville an author of some celebrity and more merit that i was exceedingly weary of those doleful ditties with which we were favoured for so many years no sooner had lord byron declared himself unhappy than every young gentleman with a pale face and dark hair used to think himself justified in frowning in the glass and writing odes to despair all persons who could scribble two lines were sure to make them into rhymes of blight and night never was there so grand a penchant for the triste it would be interesting enough observed vincent to trace the origin of this melancholy mania people are wrong to attribute it to poor lord byronit certainly came from germany perhaps werter was the first hero of that school there seems said i an unaccountable prepossession among all persons to imagine that whatever seems gloomy must be profound and whatever is cheerful must be shallow they have put poor philosophy into deep mourning and given her a coffin for a writingdesk and a skull for an inkstand oh cried vincent i remember some lines so applicable to your remark that i must forthwith interrupt you in order to introduce them madame de stael said in one of her works that melancholy was a source of perfection listen now to my author une femme nous dit et nous prouve en effet quavant quelques mille ans lhomme sera parfait quil devra cet etat a la melancolie on sait que la tristesse annonce le genie nous avons deja fait des progres etonnans que de tristes ecritsque de tristes romans des plus noires horreurs nous sommes idolatres et la melancolie a gagne nos theatres what cried i are you so well acquainted with my favourite book yours exclaimed vincent gods what a sympathy la gastronomie poeme par j berchoux it has long been my most familiar acquaintance but tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad my eye followed vincents to ascertain the meaning of this question and rested upon glanville who had that moment entered the room i might have known that he was expected by lady rosevilles abstraction the restlessness with which she started at times from her seat and as instantly resumed </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> resumed it and her fond expecting looks towards the door every time it shut or opened which denoted so strongly the absent and dreaming heart of the woman who loves glanville seemed paler than usual and perhaps even sadder but he was less distrait and abstracted no sooner did he see than he approached me and extended his hand with great cordiality his hand thought i and i could not bring myself to accept it i merely addressed him in the commonplace salutation he looked hard and inquisitively at me and then turned abruptly away lady roseville had risen from her chairher eyes followed him he had thrown himself on a settee near the window she went up to him and sate herself by his side i turnedmy face burntmy heart beati was now next to ellen glanville she was looking down apparently employed with some engravings but i thought her hand that small delicate titania hand trembled there was a pause vincent was talking with the other occupiers of the table a woman at such times is always the first to speak we have not seen you mr pelham said ellen since your return to town i have been very ill i answered and i felt my voice falter ellen looked up anxiously at my face i could not brook those large deep tender eyes and it now became my turn to occupy myself with the prints you do look pale she said in a low voice i did not trust myself with a further remarkdissimulator as i was to others i was like a guilty child before the woman i loved there was another pauseat last ellen said how do you think my brother looks i started yes he was her brother and i was once more myself at that thought i answered so coldly and almost haughtily that ellen coloured and said with some dignity that she should join lady roseville i bowed slightly and she withdrew to the countess i seized my hat and departedbut not utterly alonei had managed to secrete the book which ellens hand had marked through many a bitter day and sleepless night that book has been my only companion i have it before me now and it is open at a page which is yet blistered with the traces of former tears </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxviii our mistress is a little given to philosophy what disputations shall we have here by and bygil blas it was now but seldom that i met ellen for i went little into general society and grew every day more engrossed in political affairs sometimes however when wearied of myself and my graver occupations i yielded to my mothers solicitations and went to one of the nightly haunts of the goddess we term pleasure and the greeks moria the game of dissipation to use a spanish proverb shuffled us together it was then that i had the most difficult task of my life to learn and to perform to check the lipthe eyethe soulto heap curb on curb upon the gushings of the heart which daily and hourly yearned to overflow and to feel that while the mighty and restless tides of passion were thus fettered and restrained all within was a parched and arid wilderness that wasted itself for want of very moisture away yet there was something grateful in the sadness with which i watched her form in the dance or listened to her voice in the song and i felt soothed and even happy when my fancy flattered itself that her step never now seemed so light as it was wont to be when in harmony with mine nor the songs that pleased her most so gay as those that were formerly her choice distant and unobserved i loved to feed my eyes upon her pale and downcast cheek to note the abstraction that came over her at moments even when her glance seemed brightest and her lip most fluent and to know that while a fearful mystery might for ever forbid the union of our hands there was an invisible but electric chain which connected the sympathies of our hearts ah why is it that the noblest of our passions should be also the most selfishthat while we would make all earthly sacrifice for the one we love we are perpetually demanding a sacrifice in return that if we cannot have the rapture of blessing we find a consolation in the power to afflict and that we acknowledge while we reprobate the maxim of the sage lon veut faire tout le bonheur ou si cela ne se peut ainsi tout le malheur de ce quon aime the beauty of ellen was not of that nature which rests solely upon the freshness of youth nor even the magic of expression it was as faultless as it was dazzling no one could deny its excess or its perfection her praises came constantly to my ear into whatever society i went say what we will of the power of love it borrows greatly from opinion pride above all things sanctions and strengthens affection when all voices were united to panegyrize her beautywhen i knew that the powers of her witthe charms of her conversationthe accurate judgment united to the sparkling imagination were even more remarkable characteristics of her mind than loveliness of her person i could not but feel my ambition as well as my tenderness excited i dwelt with a double intensity on my choice and with a tenfold bitterness on the obstacles which forbade me to indulge it yet there was one circumstance to which in spite of all the evidence against reginald my mind still fondly and eagerly clung in searching the pockets of the unfortunate tyrrell the money he had mentioned to me as being in his possession could not be discovered had glanville been the murderer at all events he could not have been the robber it was true that in the death scuffle which in all probability took place the money might have fallen from the person of the deceased either among the long grass which grew rankly and luxuriantly around or in the sullen and slimy pool close to which the murder was perpetrated it was also possible that thornton knowing the deceased had so large a sum about him and not being aware that the circumstance had been communicated to me or any one else might not have been able when he and dawson first went to the spot to resist so great a temptation however there was a slight crevice in this fact for a sunbeam of hope to enter and i was too sanguine by habitual temperament and present passion not to turn towards it from the general darkness of my thoughts with glanville i was often brought into immediate contact both united in the same party and engaged in concerting the same measures we frequently met in public and sometimes even alone however i was invariably cold and distant and glanville confirmed rather than diminished my suspicions by making no commentary on my behaviour and imitating it in the indifference of his own yet it was with a painful and aching heart that i marked in his emaciated from and sunken cheek the gradual but certain progress of disease and death and while all england rung with the renown of the young but almost unrivalled orator and both parties united in anticipating the certainty and brilliancy of his success i felt how improbable it was that even if his crime escaped the unceasing vigilance of justice this living world would long possess any traces of his genius but the remembrance of his name there was something in his love of letters his habits of luxury and expence the energy of his mindthe solitude the darkness the hauteur the reserve of his manners and life which reminded me of the german wallenstein nor was he altogether without the superstition of that evil but extraordinary man it is true that he was not addicted to the romantic fables of astrology but he was an earnest though secret advocate of the world of spirits he did not utterly disbelieve the various stories of their return to earth and their visits to the living and it would have been astonishing to me had i been a less diligent observer of human inconsistencies to mark a mind otherwise so reasoning and strong in this respect so credulous and weak and to witness its reception of a belief not only so adverse to ordinary reflection but so absolutely contradictory to the philosophy it passionately cultivated and the principles it obstinately espoused one evening i vincent and clarendon were alone at lady rosevilles when reginald and his sister entered i rose to depart la belle contesse would not suffer it and when i looked at ellen and saw her blush at my glance the weakness of my heart conquered and i remained our conversation turned partly upon books and principally on the science du coeur et du monde for lady roseville was un peu philosophe as well as more than un peu litteraire and her house like those of the du deffands and depinays of the old french regime was one where serious subjects were cultivated as well as the lighter ones where it was the mode to treat no less upon things than to scandalize persons and where maxims on men and reflections on manners were as much in their places as strictures on the opera and invitations to balls all who were now assembled were more or less suited to one another all were people of the world and yet occasional students of the closet but all had a different method of expressing their learning or their observations clarendon was dry formal shrewd and possessed of the suspicious philosophy common to men hacknied in the world vincent relieved his learning by the quotation or metaphor or originality of some sort with which it was expressed lady roseville seldom spoke much but when she did it was rather with grace than solidity she was naturally melancholy and pensive and her observations partook of the colourings of her mind but she was also a dame de la cour accustomed to conceal and her language was gay and trifling </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> trifling while the sentiments it clothed were pensive and sad ellen glanville was an attentive listener but a diffident speaker though her knowledge was even masculine for its variety and extent she was averse to displaying it the childish the lively the tender were the outward traits of her characterthe flowers were above but the mine was beneath one noted the beauty of the formerone seldom dreamt of the value of the latter glanvilles favourite method of expressing himself was terse and sententious he did not love the labour of detail he conveyed the knowledge of years in a problem sometimes he was fanciful sometimes false but generally dark melancholy and bitter as for me i entered more into conversation at lady rosevilles than i usually do elsewhere being according to my favourite philosophy gay on the serious and serious on the gay and perhaps this is a juster method of treating the two than would be readily imagined for things which are usually treated with importance are for the most part deserving of ridicule and those which we receive as trifles swell themselves into a consequence we little dreamt of before they depart vincent took up a volume it was shelleys posthumous poems how fine said he some of these are but they are fine fragments of an architecture in bad taste they are imperfect in themselves and faulty in the school they belonged to yet such as they are the masterhand is evident upon them they are like the pictures of paul veroneseoften offending the eye often irritating the judgment but redolent of something vast and loftytheir very faults are majesticthis age perhaps no other will ever do them justicebut the disciples of future schools will make glorious pillage of their remains the writings of shelley would furnish matter for a hundred volumes they are an admirable museum of illarranged curiositiesthey are diamonds awkwardly set but one of them in the hands of a skilful jeweller would be inestimable and the poet of the future will serve him as mercury did the tortoise in his own translation from homermake him sing sweetly when hes dead their lyres will be made out of his shell if i judge rightly said clarendon his literary faults were these he was too learned in his poetry and too poetical in his learning learning is the bane of a poet imagine how beautiful petrarch would be without his platonic conceits fancy the luxuriant imagination of cowley left to run wild among the lofty objects of nature not the minute peculiarities of art even milton who made a more graceful and gorgeous use of learning than perhaps any other poet would have been far more popular if he had been more familiar poetry is for the multitudeerudition for the few in proportion as you mix them erudition will gain in readers and poetry lose true said glanville and thus the poetical among philosophers are the most popular of their time and the philosophical among poets the least popular of theirs take care said vincent smiling that we are not misled by the point of your deduction the remark is true but with a certain reservation viz that the philosophy which renders a poet less popular must be the philosophy of learning not of wisdom wherever it consists in the knowledge of the plainer springs of the heart and not in abstruse inquiry into its metaphysical and hidden subtleties it necessarily increases the popularity of the poem because instead of being limited to the few it comes home to every one thus it is the philosophy of shakspeare byron horace pope moliere which has put them into every ones hands and heartswhile that of propertius even of lucretius of cowley and shelley makes us often throw down the book because it fatigues us with the scholar philosophy therefore only sins in poetry when in the severe garb of learning it becomes harsh and crabbed and not musical as is apollos lute alas said i how much more difficult than of yore education is becomeformerly it had only one objectto acquire learning and now we have not only to acquire it but to know what to do with it when we havenay there are not a few cases where the very perfection of learning will be to appear ignorant perhaps said glanville the very perfection of wisdom may consist in retaining actual ignorance where was there ever the individual who after consuming years life health in the pursuit of science rested satisfied with its success or rewarded by its triumph common sense tells us that the best method of employing life is to enjoy it common sense tells us also the ordinary means of this enjoyment health competence and the indulgence but the moderate indulgence of our passions what have these to do with science i might tell you replied vincent that i myself have been no idle nor inactive seeker after the hidden treasures of mind and that from my own experience i could speak of pleasure pride complacency in the pursuit that were no inconsiderable augmenters of my stock of enjoyment but i have the candour to confess also that i have known disappointment mortification despondency of mind and infirmity of body that did more than balance the account the fact is in my opinion that the individual is a sufferer for his toils but then the mass is benefited by his success it is we who reap in idle gratification what the husbandman has sown in the bitterness of labour genius did not save milton from poverty and blindnessnor tasso from the madhousenor galileo from the inquisition they were the sufferers but posterity the gainers the literary empire reverses the political it is not the many made for oneit is the one made for many wisdom and genius must have their martyrs as well as religion and with the same results viz semen ecclesioeest sanguis martyrorum and this reflection must console us for their misfortunes for perhaps it was sufficient to console them in the midst of the most affecting passage in the most wonderful work perhaps ever produced for the mixture of universal thought with individual interesti mean the two last cantos of childe haroldthe poet warms from himself at his hopes of being remembered in his line with his lands language and who can read the noble and heartspeaking apology of algernon sidney without entering into his consolation no less than his misfortunes speaking of the law being turned into a snare instead of a protection and instancing its uncertainty and danger in the times of richard the second he says god only knows what will be the issue of the like practices in these our days perhaps he will in his mercy speedily visit his afflicted people i die in the faith that he will do it though i know not the time or ways i love said clarendon the enthusiasm which places comfort in so noble a source but is vanity think you a less powerful agent than philanthropy is it not the desire of shining before men that prompts us to whatever may effect it and if it can create can it not also support i mean that if you allow that to shine to eclater to enjoy praise is no ordinary incentive to the commencement of great works the conviction of future success for this desire becomes no inconsiderable reward grant for instance that this desire produced the paradise lost and you will not deny that it might also support the poet through his misfortunes do you think that he thought rather of the pleasure his work should afford to posterity than of the praises posterity should extend to his work had not cicero left us such frank confessions of himself how patriotic how philanthropic we should have esteemed him now we know both his motive and meed was vanity may we not extend the knowledge of human nature which we have gained in this instance by applying it to others for my part i should be loth to inquire how great a quantum of vanity mingled with the haughty patriotism of sidney or the unconquered spirit of cato glanville bowed his head in approval but observed i why be so uncharitable to this poor and persecuted principle since none of you deny the good and great actions it effects why stigmatize vanity as a vice when it creates or at least participates in so many virtues i wonder the ancients did not erect the choicest of their temples to its worship quant a moi i shall henceforth only speak of it as the primum mobile of whatever we venerate and admire and shall think it the highest compliment i can pay to a man to tell him he is eminently vain i incline to your opinion cried vincent laughing the reason we dislike vanity in others is because it is perpetually hurting our own of all passions if for the moment i may call it such it is the most indiscreet it is for ever blabbing out its own secrets if it would but keep its counsel it would be as graciously received in society as any other welldressed and wellbred intruder of quality its garrulity makes it despised but in truth it must be clear that vanity in itself is neither a vice nor a virtue any more than this knife in itself is dangerous or useful the person who employs gives it its qualities thus for instance a great mind desires to shine or is vain in great actions a frivolous one in frivolities and so on through the varieties of the human intellect but i cannot agree with mr clarendon that my admiration of algernon sidney cato i never did admire would be at all lessened by the discovery that his resistance to tyranny in a great measure originated in vanity or that the same vanity consoled him when he fell a victim to that resistance for what does it prove but this that among the various feelings of his soul indignation at oppression so common to all menenthusiasm for liberty so predominant in himthe love of benefiting othersthe noble pride of being in death consistent with himself among all these feelings among a crowd of others equally </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> equally honourable and purethere was also one and perhaps no inconsiderable feeling of desire that his life and death should be hereafter appreciated justlycontemptu famoe contemni virtutemcontempt of fame is the contempt of virtue never consider that vanity an offence which limits itself to wishing for the praise of good men for good actions next to our own esteem says the best of the roman philosophers it is a virtue to desire the esteem of others by your emphasis on the word esteem said lady roseville i suppose you attach some peculiar importance to the word i do answered vincent i use it in contradistinction to admiration we may covet general admiration for a bad actionfor many bad actions have the clinquant which passes for real goldbut one can expect general esteem only for a good one from this distinction said ellen modestly may we not draw an inference which will greatly help us in our consideration of vanity may we not deem that vanity which desires only the esteem of others to be invariably a virtue and that which only longs for admiration to be frequently a vice we may admit your inference said vincent and before i leave this question i cannot help remarking upon the folly of the superficial who imagine by studying human motives that philosophers wish to depreciate human actions to direct our admiration to a proper point is surely not to destroy it yet how angry inconsiderate enthusiasts are when we assign real in the place of exaggerated feelings thus the advocates for the doctrine of utilitythe most benevolent because the most indulgent of all philosophiesare branded with the epithets of selfish and interested decriers of moral excellence and disbelievers in generous actions vice has no friend like the prejudices which call themselves virtue la pretexte ordinaire de ceux qui font le malheur des autres est quils veulent leur bien my eyes were accidentally fixed on glanville as vincent ceased he looked up and coloured faintly as he met my look but he did not withdraw his ownkeenly and steadily we gazed upon each other till ellen turning round suddenly remarked the unwonted meaning of our looks and placed her hand in her brothers with a sort of fear it was late he rose to withdraw and passing me said in a low tone a little while and you shall know all i made no answerhe left the room with ellen lady roseville has had but a dull evening i fear with our stupid saws and antient instances said vincent the eyes of the person he addressed were fixed upon the door i was standing close by her and as the words struck her ear she turned abruptlya tear fell upon my handshe perceived it and though i would not look upon her face i saw that her very neck blushed but she like me if she gave way to feeling had learnt too deep a lesson from the world not readily to resume her selfcommand she answered vincent railingly upon his bad compliment to us and received our adieus with all her customary grace and more than her customary gaiety </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxix ah sir had i but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade that i have in learning to be a scoundrel i might have been a rich man at this day but rogue as i am still i may be your friend and that perhaps when you least expect itvicar of wakefield what with the anxiety and uncertainty of my political prospects the continued dissipation in which i lived and above all the unpropitious state of my belle passion my health gave way my appetite forsook memy sleep failed mea wrinkle settled itself under my left eye and my mother declared that i should have no chance with an heiress all these circumstances together were not without their weight so i set out one morning to hampton court with a volume of bishop berkely and a bottle of wrinkle water for the benefit of the country air it is by no means an unpleasant thing to turn ones back upon the great city in the height of its festivities misanthropy is a charming feeling for a short time and one inhales the country and animadverts on the town with the most melancholy satisfaction in the world i sat myself down at a pretty little cottage a mile out of the town from the window of my drawingroom i revelled in the luxurious contemplation of three pigs one cow and a strawyard and i could get to the thames in a walk of five minutes by a short cut through a limekiln such pleasing opportunities of enjoying the beauties of nature are not often to be met with you may be sure therefore that i made the most of them i rose early walked before breakfast pour ma sante and came back with a most satisfactory headache pour mes peines i read for just three hours walked for two more thought over abernethy dyspepsia and blue pills till dinner and absolutely forgot lord dawton ambition guloseton epicurismaye all butof course reader you know whom i am about to exceptthe ladye of my love one bright laughing day i threw down my book an hour sooner than usual and sallied out with a lightness of foot and exhilaration of spirit to which i had long been a stranger i had just sprung over a stile that led into one of those green shady lanes which make us feel the old poets who loved and lived for nature were right in calling our island the merry englandwhen i was startled by a short quick bark on one side of the hedge i turned sharply round and seated upon the sward was a man apparently of the pedlar profession a large deal box was lying open before him a few articles of linen and female dress were scattered round and the man himself appeared earnestly occupied in examining the deeper recesses of his itinerant warehouse a small black terrier flew towards me with no friendly growl down said i all strangers are not foes though the english generally think so the man hastily looked up perhaps he was struck with the quaintness of my remonstrance to his canine companion for touching his hat civilly he saidthe dog sir is very quiet he only means to give me the alarm by giving it to you for dogs seem to have no despicable insight into human nature and know well that the best of us may be taken by surprise you are a moralist said i not a little astonished in my turn by such an address from such a person i could not have expected to stumble upon a philosopher so easily have you any wares in your box likely to suit me if so i should like to purchase of so moralizing a vendor no sir said the seeming pedlar smiling and yet at the same time hurrying his goods into his box and carefully turning the keyno sir i am only a bearer of other mens goods my morals are all that i can call my own and those i will sell you at your own price you are candid my friend said i and your frankness alone would be inestimable in this age of deceit and country of hypocrisy ah sir said my new acquaintance i see already that you are one of those persons who look to the dark side of things for my part i think the present age the best that ever existed and our own country the most virtuous in europe i congratulate you mr optimist on your opinions quoth i but your observation leads me to suppose that you are both an historian and a traveller am i right why answered the boxbearer i have dabbled a little in books and wandered not a little among men i am just returned from germany and am now going to my friends in london i am charged with this box of goods god send me the luck to deliver it safe amen said i and with that prayer and this trifle i wish you a good morning thank you a thousand times sir for both replied the manbut do add to your favours by informing me of the right road to the town of i am going in that direction myself if you choose to accompany me part of the way i can ensure your not missing the rest your honour is too good returned he of the box rising and slinging his fardel across himit is but seldom that a gentleman of your rank will condescend to walk three paces with one of mine you smile sir perhaps you think i should not class myself among gentlemen and yet i have as good a right to the name as most of the set i belong to no tradei follow no calling i rove where i list and rest where i please in short i know no occupation but my indolence and no law but my will now sir may i not call myself a gentleman of a surety quoth i you seem to me to hold a middle rank between a halfpay captain and the king of the gipsies you have hit it sir rejoined my companion with a slight laugh he was now by my side and as we walked on i had leisure more minutely to examine him he was a middlesized and rather athletic man apparently about the age of thirtyeight he was attired in a dark blue frock coat which was neither shabby nor new but ill made and much too large and long for its present possessor beneath this was a faded velvet waistcoat that had formerly like the persian ambassadors tunic blushed with crimson and blazed with gold but which might now have been advantageously exchanged in monmouthstreet for the lawful sum of two shillings and ninepence under this was an inner vest of the cashmere shawl pattern which seemed much too new for the rest of the dress though his shirt was of a very unwashed hue i remarked with some suspicion that it was of a very respectable fineness and a pin which might be </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> be paste or could be diamond peeped below a tattered and dingy black kid stock like a gipseys eye beneath her hair his trowsers were of a light grey and providence or the tailor avenged itself upon them for the prodigal length bestowed upon their illsorted companion the coat for they were much too tight for the muscular limbs they concealed and rising far above the ankle exhibited the whole of a thick wellington boot which was the very picture of italy upon the map the face of the man was commonplace and ordinary one sees a hundred such every day in fleetstreet or the change the features were small irregular and somewhat flat yet when you looked twice upon the countenance there was something marked and singular in the expression which fully atoned for the commonness of the features the right eye turned away from the left in that watchful squint which seems constructed on the same considerate plan as those irish guns made for shooting round a corner his eyebrows were large and shaggy and greatly resembled bramble bushes in which his foxlike eyes had taken refuge round these vulpine retreats were a labyrinthean maze of those wrinkles vulgarly called crowsfeetdeep intricate and intersected they seemed for all the world like the web of a chancery suit singular enough the rest of the countenance was perfectly smooth and unindented even the lines from the nostril to the corners of the mouth usually so deeply traced in men of his age were scarcely more apparent than in a boy of eighteen his smile was frankhis voice clear and heartyhis address open and much superior to his apparent rank of life claiming somewhat of equality yet conceding a great deal of respect but notwithstanding all these certainly favourable points there was a sly and cunning expression in his perverse and vigilant eye and all the wrinkled demesnes in its vicinity that made me mistrust even while i liked my companion perhaps indeed he was too frank too familiar too degage to be quite natural your honest men soon buy reserve by experience rogues are communicative and open because confidence and openness cost them nothing to finish the description of my new acquaintance i should observe that there was something in his countenance which struck me as not wholly unfamiliar it was one of those which we have not in all human probability seen before and yet which perhaps from their very commonness we imagine we have encountered a hundred times we walked on briskly notwithstanding the warmth of the day in fact the air was so pure the grass so green the laughing noonday so full of the hum the motion and the life of creation that the sensation produced was rather that of freshness and invigoration than of languor and heat we have a beautiful country sir said my hero of the box it is like walking through a garden after the more sterile and sullen features of the continenta pure mind sir loves the country for my part i am always disposed to burst out in thanksgiving to providence when i behold its works and like the vallies in the psalm i am ready to laugh and sing an enthusiast said i as well as a philosopherperhaps and i believed it likely i have the honour of addressing a poet also why sir replied the man i have made verses in my life in short there is little i have not done for i was always a lover of variety but perhaps your honour will let me return the suspicion are you not a favourite of the muse i cannot say that i am said i i value myself only on my common sensethe very antipodes to genius you know according to the orthodox belief common sense repeated my companion with a singular and meaning smile and a twinkle with his left eye common sense ah that is not my forte sir you i dare say are one of those gentlemen whom it is very difficult to take in either passively or actively by appearance or in act for my part i have been a dupe all my lifea child might cheat me i am the most unsuspicious person in the world too candid by half thought i the man is certainly a rascal but whats that to me i shall never see him again and true to my love of never losing an opportunity of ascertaining individual character i observed that i thought such an acquaintance very valuable especially if he were in trade it was a pity therefore for my sake that my companion had informed me that he followed no calling why sir said he i am occasionally in employment my nominal profession is that of a broker i buy shawls and handkerchiefs of poor countesses and retail them to rich plebeians i fit up new married couples with linen at a more moderate rate than the shops and procure the bridegroom his present of jewels at forty per cent less than the jewellers nay i am as friendly to an intrigue as a marriage and when i cannot sell my jewels i will my good offices a gentleman so handsome as your honour may have an affair upon your hands if so you may rely upon my secrecy and zeal in short i am an innocent goodnatured fellow who does harm to no one for nothing and good to every one for something i admire your code quoth i and whenever i want a mediator between venus and myself will employ you have you always followed your present idle profession or were you brought up to any other i was intended for a silversmith answered my friend but providence willed it otherwise they taught me from childhood to repeat the lords prayer heaven heard me and delivered me from temptationthere is indeed something terribly seducing in the face of a silver spoon well said i you are the honestest knave i ever met and one would trust you with ones purse for the ingenuousness with which you own you would steal it pray think you it is probable that i have ever had the happiness to meet you before i cannot help fancying soyet as i have never been in the watchhouse or the old bailey my reason tells me that i must be mistaken not at all sir returned my worthy i remember you well for i never saw a face like yours that i did not remember i had the honour of sipping some british liquors in the same room with yourself one evening you were then in company with my friend mr gordon ha said i i thank ye for the hint i now remember well by the same token that he told me you were the most ingenious gentleman in england and that you had a happy propensity of mistaking other peoples possessions for your own i congratulate myself upon so desirable an acquaintance note see vol ii p 127 my friend who was indeed no other than mr job jonson smiled with his usual blandness and made me a low bow of acknowledgment before he resumed no doubt sir mr gordon informed you right i flatter myself few gentlemen understand better than myself the art of appropriation though i say it who should not say it i deserve the reputation i have acquired sir i have always had ill fortune to struggle against and have always remedied it by two virtuesperseverance and ingenuity to give you an idea of my ill fortune know that i have been taken up twentythree times on suspicion of my perseverance know that twentythree times i have been taken up justly and of my ingenuity know that i have been twentythree times let off because there was not a tittle of legal evidence against me i venerate your talents mr jonson replied i if by the name of jonson it pleaseth you to be called although like the heathen deities i presume that you have many other titles whereof some are more grateful to your ears than others nay answered the man of two virtuesi am never ashamed of my name indeed i have never done any thing to disgrace me i have never indulged in low company nor profligate debauchery whatever i have executed by way of profession has been done in a superior and artistlike manner not in the rude bungling way of other adventurers moreover i have always had a taste for polite literature and went once as apprentice to a publishing bookseller for the sole purpose of reading the new works before they came out in fine i have never neglected any opportunity of improving my mind and the worst that can be said against me is that i have remembered my catechism and taken all possible pains to learn and labour truly to get my living and do my duty in that state of life to which it has pleased providence to call me i have often heard answered i that there is honour among thieves i am happy to learn from you that there is also religion your baptismal sponsors must be proud of so diligent a godson they ought to be sir replied mr jonson for i gave them the first specimens of my address the story is long but if you ever give me an opportunity i will relate it thank you said i meanwhile i must wish you good morning your road now lies to the right i return you my best thanks for your condescension in accompanying so undistinguished an individual as myself oh never mention it your honour rejoined mr jonson i am always too happy to walk with a gentleman of your common sense farewell sir may we meet again so saying mr jonson struck into his new road and we parted note if any one should think this sketch from nature exaggerated i refer him to the memoirs of james hardy vaux i went home musing on my adventure and delighted with my adventurer when i was about three paces from the door of my home i was accosted in a most pitiful tone by a poor old beggar apparently in the last extreme of misery </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> misery and disease notwithstanding my political economy i was moved into almsgiving by a spectacle so wretched i put my hand into my pocket my purse was gone and on searching the other lomy handkerchief my pocketbook and a gold bracelet which had belonged to madame danville had vanished too one does not keep company with men of two virtues and receive compliments upon ones common sense for nothing the beggar still continued to importune me give him some food and half a crown said i to my landlady two hours afterwards she came up to meoh sir my silver teapotthat villain the beggar a light flashed upon meah mr job jonson mr job jonson cried i in an indescribable rage out of my sight woman out of my sight i stopped short my speech failed me never tell me that shame is the companion of guiltthe sinful knave is never so ashamed of himself as is the innocent fool who suffers by him </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxx then must i plunge again into the crowd and follow all that peace disdains to seekbyron in the quiet of my retreat i remained for eight daysduring which time i never looked once at a newspaperimagine how great was my philosophy on the ninth i began to think it high time i should hear from dawton and finding that i had eaten two rolls for breakfast and that my untimely wrinkle began to assume a more mitigated appearance i bethought me once more of the beauties of babylon while i was in this kindly mood towards the great city and its inhabitants my landlady put two letters in my handone was from my mother the other from guloseton i opened the latter first it ran thus dear pelham i was very sorry to hear you had left townand so unexpectedly too i obtained your address from mivarts and hasten to avail myself of it pray come to town immediately i have received some chevreuil as a present and long for your opinion it is too nice to keep for all things nice were made but to grow bad when nicest as moore i believe says of flowers substituting sweet and fleetest for bad and nicest so you see you must come without loss of time but you my friendhow can you possibly have been spending your time i was kept awake all last night by thinking what you could have for dinner fish is out of the question in the country chickens die of the pip every where but in london game is out of season it is impossible to send to gibblets for meat it is equally impossible to get it any where else and as for the only two natural productions of the country vegetables and eggs i need no extraordinary penetration to be certain that your cook cannot transmute the latter into an omelette aux huitres on the former into legumes a la creme thus you see by a series of undeniable demonstrations you must absolutely be in a state of starvation at this thought the tears rush into my eyes for heavens sake for my sake for your own sake but above all for the sake of the chevreuil hasten to london i figure you to myself in the last stage of atrophyairy as a trifle thin as the ghost of a greyhound i need say no more on the subject i may rely on your own discretion to procure me the immediate pleasure of your company indeed were i to dwell longer on your melancholy situation my feelings would overcome memais revenons a nos moutonsa most pertinent phrase by the byoh the french excel us in every thing from the paramount science of cookery to the little art of conversation you must tell me your candid your unbiased your deliberate opinion of chevreuil for my part i should not wonder at the mythology of the northern heathen nations which places hunting among the chief enjoyments of their heaven were chevreuil the object of their chace but nihil est omni parte beatum it wants fat my dear pelham it wants fat nor do i see how to remedy this defect for were we by art to supply the fat we should deprive ourselves of the flavour bestowed by nature and this my dear pelham was always my great argument for liberty cooped chained and confined in cities and slavery all things lose the fresh and generous tastes which it is the peculiar blessing of freedom and the country to afford tell me my friend what has been the late subject of your reflections my thoughts have dwelt much and seriously on the terra incognita the undiscovered tracts in the pays culinaire which the profoundest investigators have left untouched and unexplored in veal but more of this hereafterthe lightness of a letter is ill suited to the depths of philosophical research lord dawton sounded me upon my votes yesterday a thousand pities too said he that you never speak in the house of lords orator fit said iorators are subject to apoplexy adieu my dear friend for friend you are if the philosopher was right in defining true friendship to consist in liking and disliking the same things seneca you hate parsnips au naturelso do i you love pates du foie gras et moi aussinous voila les meilleurs amis du monde guloseton so much for my friend thought iand now for my mother opening the maternal epistle which i herewith transcribe my dear henry lose no time in coming to town every day the ministers are filling up the minor places and it requires a great stretch of recollection in a politician to remember the absent mr v said yesterday at a dinner party where i was present that lord dawton had promised him the borough of now you know my dear henry that was the very borough he promised to you you must see further into this lord dawton is a good sort of man enough but refused once to fight a duel therefore if he has disregarded his honour in one instance he may do so in another at all events you have no time to lose the young duke ofgives a ball tomorrow evening mrspays all the expenses and i know for a certainty that she will marry him in a week this as yet is a secret there will be a great mixture but the ball will be worth going to i have a card for you lady huffemall and i think that we shall not patronize the future duchess but have not yet made up our minds lady roseville however speaks of the intended match with great respect and says that since we admit convenance as the chief rule in matrimony she never remembers an instance in which it has been more consulted there are to be several promotions in the peerage lord hs friends wish to give out that he will have a dukedom mais jen doute however he has well deserved it for he not only gives the best dinners in town but the best account of them in the morning post afterwards which i think is very properly upholding the dignity of our order i hope most earnestly that you do not in your country retreat neglect your health nor i may add your mind and that you take an opportunity every other day of practising waltzing which you can very well do with the help of an armchair i would send you down did i not expect you here so soon lord mount es musical reminiscences not only because it is a very entertaining book but because i wish you to pay much greater attention to music than you seem inclined to do t hwho is never very refined in his bon mots says that lord m seems to have considered the world a concert in which the best performer plays first fiddle it is indeed quite delightful to see the veneration our musical friend has for the orchestra and its occupants i wish to heaven my dear henry he could instil into you a little of his ardour i am quite mortified at times by your ignorance of tunes and operas nothing tells better in conversation than a knowledge of music as you will one day or other discover god bless you my dearest henry fully expecting you i have sent to engage your former rooms at mivarts do not let me be disappointed yours f p i read the above letter twice over and felt my cheek glow and my heart swell as i passed the passage relative to lord dawton and the borough the new minister had certainly for some weeks since been playing a double part with me it would long ago have been easy to procure me a subordinate situationstill easier to place me in parliament yet he had contented himself with doubtful promises and idle civilities what however seemed to me most unaccountable was his motive in breaking or paltering with his engagement he knew that i had served him and his party better than half his corps he professed not only to me but to society the highest opinion of my abilities knowledge and application he saw consequently how serviceable i could be as a friend and from the same qualities joined to the rank of my birth and connections and the high and resentful temper of my mind he might readily augur that i could be equally influential as a foe with this reflection i stilled the beating of my heart and the fever of my pulse i crushed the obnoxious letter in my hand walked thrice up and down my room paused at the bellrung it violentlyordered post horses instantly and in less than an hour was on the road to london how different is the human mind according to the difference of place in our passions as in our creeds we are the mere dependents of geographical situation nay the trifling variation of a single mile will revolutionize the whole tides and torrents of our hearts the man who is meek generous benevolent and kind in the country enters the scene of contest and becomes forthwith fiery or mean selfish or stern just as if the virtues </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> virtues were only for solitude and the vices for the city i have ill expressed the above reflection nimporteso much the better shall i explain my feelings at the time i speak offor i was then too eager and engrossed to attend to the niceties of words on my arrival at mivarts i scarcely allowed myself time to change my dress before i set out to lord dawton he shall afford me an explanation i thought or a recompence or a revenge i knocked at the doorthe minister was out give him this card said i haughtily to the porter and say i shall call tomorrow at three i walked to brookessthere i met mr v my acquaintance with him was small but he was a man of talent and what was more to my purpose of open manners i went up to him and we entered into conversation is it true said i that i am to congratulate you upon the certainty of your return for lord dawtons borough of i believe so replied v lord dawton engaged it to me last week and mr h the present member has accepted the chiltern hundreds you know all our family support lord dawton warmly on the present crisis and my return for this borough was materially insisted upon such things are you see mr pelham even in these virtuous days of parliamentary purity true said i dissembling my chagrin yourself and dawton have made an admirable exchange think you the ministry can be said to be fairly seated by no means every thing depends upon the motion of brought on next week dawton looks to that as to the decisive battle for this session lord gavelton now joined us and i sauntered away with the utmost seeming indifference at the top of st jamessstreet lady rosevilles well known carriage passed meshe stopped for a moment we shall meet at the duke ofs tonight said she shall we not if you gocertainly i replied i went home to my solitary apartment and if i suffered somewhat of the torments of baffled hope and foiled ambition the pang is not for the spectator my lighter moments are for the worldmy deeper for myself and like the spartan boy i would keep even in the pangs of death a mantle over the teeth and fangs which are fastening upon my breast </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxi nocet empta dolore voluptasovid the first person i saw at the duke ofs was mr mivarthe officiated as gentleman usher the second was my mothershe was as usual surrounded by men the shades of heroes that have been remnants of a former day when the feet of the young and fair lady frances were as light as her head and she might have rivalled in the science de la danse even the graceful duchess of bd over the dandies of her own time she still preserved her ancient empire and it was amusing enough to hear the address of the cidevant jeunes hommes who continued through habit the compliments began thirty years since through admiration my mother was indeed what the world calls a very charming agreeable woman few persons were more popular in society her manners were perfectionher smile enchantment she lived moved breathed only for the world and the world was not ungrateful for the constancy of her devotion yet if her letters have given my readers any idea of her character they will perceive that the very desire of supremacy in ton gave god forgive my filial impiety a sort of demivulgarism to her ideas for they who live wholly for the opinion of others always want that selfdignity which alone confers a high cast to the sentiments and the most really unexceptionable in mode are frequently the least genuinely patrician in mind i joined the maternal party and lady frances soon took an opportunity of whispering you are looking very well and very handsome i declare you are not unlike me especially about the eyes i have just heard that miss glanville will be a great heiress for poor sir reginald cannot live much longer she is here tonight pray do not lose the opportunity my cheek burnt like fire at this speech and my mother quietly observing that i had a beautiful colour and ought therefore immediately to find out miss glanville lest it should vanish by the least delay turned from me to speak of a public breakfast about shortly to be given i passed into the dancingroom there i found vincent he was in unusually good spirits well said he with a sneer you have not taken your seat yet i suppose lord dawtons representative whose place you are to supply is like theseus sedet eternumque sedebit a thousand pities you cant come in before next week we shall then have fiery motions in the lower house as the astrologers say i smiled ah mon cher said i sparta hath many a worthier son than me meanwhile how get on the noble lords lesborough and lincoln sure such a pair were never seen so justly formed to meet by nature pooh said vincent coarsely they shall get on well enough before you get in look to yourself and remember that caesar plays the ingrate vincent turned away my eyes were rivetted on the ground the beautiful ladypassed by me what you in a reverie said she laughing our very host will turn thoughtful next nay said i in your absence would you have me glad however if moores mythology be truebeauty loves folly the better for borrowing something from reason but come this is a place not for the grave but the giddy let us join the waltzers i am engaged i know it do you think i would dance with any woman who was not engagedthere would be no triumph to ones vanity in that case allons ma belle you must prefer me to an engagement and so saying i led off my prize her intended partner was mr v just as we had joined the dancers he spied us out and approached with his long serious respectful face the music struck up and the next moment poor v was very nearly struck down fraught with the most political spite i whirled up against him apologized with my blandest smile and left him wiping his mouth and rubbing his shoulder the most forlorn picture of hope in adversity that can possibly be conceived i soon grew wearied of my partner and leaving her to fate rambled into another room there seated alone was lady roseville i placed myself beside her there was a sort of freemasonry between her and myself each knew something more of the other than the world did and we read his or her heart by other signs than words i soon saw that she was in no mirthful mood so much the bettershe was the fitter companion for a baffled aspirant like me the room we were in was almost deserted and finding ourselves uninterrupted the stream of our conversation flowed into sentiment how little said lady roseville can the crowd know of the individuals who compose it as the most opposite colours may be blended into one and so lose their individual hues and be classed under a single name so every one here will go home and speak of the gay scene without thinking for a moment how many breaking hearts may have composed it i have often thought said i how harsh we are in our judgments of othershow often we accuse those persons of being worldly who merely seem so to the world who for instance that saw you in your brightest moments would ever suppose that you could make the confession you have just made i would not make such a confession to many beside yourself answered lady roseville nay you need not thank me i am some years older than you i have lived longer in the world i have seen much of its various characters and my experience has taught me to penetrate and prize a character like yours while you seem frivolous to the superficial i know you to have a mind not only capable of the most solid and important affairs but habituated by reflection to consider them you appear effeminate i know that none are more daringindolent none are more actively ambitiousutterly selfish and i know that no earthly interest could bribe you into meanness or injusticeno nor even into a venial dereliction of principle it is from this estimate of your character that i am frank and open to you besides i recognize something in the careful pride with which you conceal your higher and deeper feelings resembling the strongest actuating principle in my own mind all this interests me warmly in your fate may it be as bright as my presentiments forebode i looked into the beautiful face of the speaker as she concluded perhaps at that solitary moment my heart was unfaithful to ellen but the infidelity passed away like the breath from the mirror coxcomb as i was i knew well how passionless was the interest expressed for me libertine as i had been i knew also how pure may be the friendship of a woman provided she loves another i thanked lady roseville warmly for her opinion perhaps i added dared i solicit your advice you would not find me wholly undeserving of your esteem my advice answered lady roseville would be indeed worse than useless were it not regulated by a certain knowledge which perhaps you do not possess you seem surprised eh bien listen to meare you not in no small degree lie with lord dawtondo you not expect something from him worthy of your rank and merit you do indeed surprise me said i however close my connection with lord dawton may be i thought it much more secret than it appears to be however i own that i have a right to expect from lord dawton not perhaps a recompense of service but at least a fulfilment of promises in this expectation i begin to believe i shall be deceived you will answered lady roseville bend your head lowerthe walls have ears you have a friend an unwearied and earnest friend with those now </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> now in power directly he heard that mr vwas promised the borough which he knew had been long engaged to you he went straight to lord dawton he found him with lord clandonald however he opened the matter immediately he spoke with great warmth of your claimshe did morehe incorporated them with his own which are of no mean order and asked no other recompense for himself than the fulfilment of a long made promise to you dawton was greatly confused and lord clandonald replied for him that certainly there was no denying your talentsthat they were very greatthat you had unquestionably been of much service to their party and that consequently it must be politic to attach you to their interests but that there was a certain fierte and assumption and he might say mark the climax independence about you which could not but be highly displeasing in one so young moreover that it was impossible to trust to youthat you pledged yourself to no partythat you spoke only of conditions and termsthat you treated the proposal of placing you in parliament rather as a matter of favour on your part than on lord dawtonsand in a word that there was no relying upon you lord dawton then took courage and chimed in with a long panegyric on v and a long account of what was due to him and to the zeal of his family adding that in a crisis like this it was absolutely necessary to engage a certain rather than a doubtful and undecided support that for his part if he placed you in parliament he thought you quite as likely to prove a foe as a friend that owing to the marriage of your uncle your expectations were by no means commensurate with your presumption and that the same talents which made your claims to favour as an ally created also no small danger in placing you in any situation where you could become hurtful as an enemy all this and much more to the same purpose was strenuously insisted upon by the worthy pair and your friend was obliged to take his leave perfectly convinced that unless you assumed a more complaisant bearing or gave a more decided pledge to the new minister it was hopeless for you to expect any thing from him at least for the present the fact is he stands too much in awe of you and would rather keep you out of the house than contribute an iota towards obtaining you a seat upon all this you may rely as certain i thank you from my heart said i warmly seizing and pressing lady rosevilles hand you tell me what i have long suspected i am now upon my guard and they shall find that i can offend as well as defend but it is no time for me to boast oblige me by informing me of the name of my unknown friend i little thought there was a being in the world who would stir three steps for henry pelham that friend replied lady roseville with a faltering voice and a glowing cheek was sir reginald glanville what cried i repeat the name to me again or i paused and recovered myself sir reginald glanville i resumed haughtily is too gracious to enter into my affairs i must be strangely altered if i need the officious zeal of any intermeddler to redress my wrongs nay mr pelham said the countess hastily you do glanvilleyou do yourself injustice for him there never passes a day in which he does not mention you with the highest encomiums and the most affectionate regard he says of late that you have altered towards him but that he does not blame youhe never mentions the cause if i am not intruding suffer me to inquire into it perhaps oh how happy it would make me i may be able to reconcile you if you knewif you could but guess half of the noble and lofty character of reginald glanville you would suffer no petty difference to divide you it is no petty difference said i rising nor am i permitted to mention the cause meanwhile may god bless you dearest lady roseville and preserve that kind and generous heart from worse pangs than those of disappointed ambition or betrayed trust lady roseville looked downher bosom heaved violently she felt the meaning of my words i left her and st js square i returned home to court sleep as vainly as the monarch in the tragedy and exclaim as idly as the peasant in the farce oh that there were no house of commons in the world </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxii good mr knave give me my due i like a tart as well as you but i would starve on good roast beef ere i would look so like a thiefthe queen of hearts nune vino pellite curas cras ingens iterabimus aequor horace the next morning i received a note from guloseton asking me to dine with him at eight to meet his chevreuil i sent back an answer in the affirmative and then gave myself wholly up to considering what was the best line of conduct to pursue with regard to lord dawton it would be pleasant enough said anger to go to him to ask him boldly for the borough so often pledged to you and in case of his refusal to confront to taunt and to break with him true replied that more homely and less stage effect arguer which we term knowledge of the world but this would be neither useful nor dignifiedcommon sense never quarrels with any one call upon lord dawton if you willask him for his promise with your second best smile and receive his excuses with your very best then do as you pleasebreak with him or notyou can do either with grace and quiet never make a scene about any thingreproach and anger always do make a scene very true said i in answer to the latter suggestionand having made up my mind i repaired a quarter before three to lord dawtons house ah pelham said the little minister delighted to see you look so much the better from the country air you will stay in town now i hope till the end of the season certainly my lord or at all events till the prorogation of parliament how indeed could i do otherwise with your lordships kind promise before my eyes mr the member for your borough of has i believe accepted the chiltern hundreds i feel truly obliged to you for so promptly fulfilling your promise to me hem my dear pelham hem murmured lord dawton i bent forward as if in the attitude of listening respect but really the more clearly to perceive and closely to enjoy his confusion he looked up and caught my eye and not being too much gratified with its involuntary expression he grew more and more embarrassed at last he summoned courage why my dear sir he said i did it is true promise you that borough but individual friendship must frequently be sacrificed to the public good all our party insisted upon returning mr vin place of the late member what could i do i mentioned your claims they all to a man enlarged upon your rivals to be sure he is an older person and his family is very powerful in the lower house in short you perceive my dear pelhamthat is you are awareyou can feel for the delicacy of my situationone could not appear too eager for ones own friends at first and i was forced to concede lord dawton was now fairly delivered of his speech it was therefore only left me to congratulate him on his offspring my dear lord i began you could not have pleased me better mr v is a most estimable man and i would not for the world have had you suspected of placing such a trifle as your own honourthat is to sayyour promise to me before the commandsthat is to say the interestsof your party but no more of this now was your lordship at the duke ofs last night dawton seized joyfully the opportunity of changing the conversation and we talked and laughed on indifferent matters till i thought it time to withdraw this i did with the most cordial appearance of regard and esteem nor was it till i had fairly set my foot out of his door that i suffered myself to indulge the black bile at my breast i turned towards the green park and was walking slowly along the principal mall with my hands behind me and my eyes on the ground when i heard my own name uttered on looking back i perceived lord vincent on horseback he stopped and conversed with me in the humour i was in with lord dawton i received him with greater warmth than i had done of late and he also being in a social mood seemed so well satisfied with our rencontre and my behaviour that he dismounted to walk with me this park is a very different scene now said vincent from what it was in the times of the merry monarch yet it is still a spot much more to my taste than its more gaudy and less classical brother of hyde there is something pleasingly melancholy in walking over places haunted by history for all of us live more in the past than the present and how exactly alike in all ages said i men have been on the very spot we are on now how many have been actuated by the same feelings that now actuate ushow many have made perhaps exactly the same remark just made by you it is this universal identity which forms our most powerful link with those that have beenthere is a satisfaction in seeing how closely we resemble the agamemnons of gone times and we take care to lose none of it by thinking how closely we also resemble the sordidi thersites true replied vincent if wise and great men did but know how little difference there is between them and the foolish or the mean they would not take such pains to be wise and great </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> great to use the chinese proverb they sacrifice a picture to get possession of its ashes it is almost a pity that the desire to progress should be so necessary to our being ambition is often a fine but never a felicitous feeling cyprian in a beautiful passage on envy calls it the moth of the soul but perhaps even that passion is less gnawing less a tabes pectoris than ambition you are surprised at my heatthe fact is i am enraged at thinking how much we forfeit when we look up only and trample unconsciously in the blindness of our aspiration on the affections which strew our path now you and i have been utterly estranged from each other of late whyfor any disputeany disagreement in privateany discovery of meannesstreachery unworthiness in the other no merely because i dine with lord lincoln and you with lord dawton voila tout well say the jesuits that they who live for the public must renounce all private ties the very day we become citizens we are to cease to be men our privacy is like leo decimus note see jovius directly it dies all peace comfort joy and sociality are to die with it and an iron age barbara vis et dira malorum omnium incommoda note see jovius to succeed it is a pity that we struck into different paths said i no pleasure would have been to me greater than making our political interests the same but perhaps there is no but interrupted vincent perhaps like the two knights in the hacknied story we are only giving different names to the same shield because we view it on different sides let us also imitate them in their reconciliation as well as their quarrel and since we have already run our lances against each other be convinced of our error and make up our difference i was silent indeed i did not like to trust myself to speak vincent continued i know said he and it is in vain for you to conceal it that you have been illused by dawton mr v is my first cousin he came to me the day after the borough was given to him and told me all that clandonald and dawton had said to him at the time believe me they did not spare youthe former you have grievously offended you know that he has quarrelled irremediably with his son dartmore and he insists that you are the friend and abettor of that ingenuous youth in all his debaucheries and extravagancetu illum corrumpi sinis i tell you this without hesitation for i know you are less vain than ambitious and i do not care about hurting you in the one point if i advance you in the other as for me i own to you candidly and frankly that there is no pains i would spare to secure you to our party join us and you shall as i have often said be on the parliamentary benches of our corps without a moment of unnecessary delay more i cannot promise you because i cannot promise more to myself but from that instant your fortune if i augur aught aright from your ability will be in your own hands you shake your headsurely you must see that there is not a difference between two vehemently opposite parties to be reconciledaut numen aut nebuchadrezar there is but a verbal disagreement between us and we must own the wisdom of the sentence recorded in aulus gellius that he is but a madman who splits the weight of things upon the hairbreadths of words you laugh at the quaintness of the quotation quaint proverbs are often the truest if my reader should think lightly of me when i own that i felt wavering and irresolute at the end of this speech let him for a moment place himself in my situationlet him feel indignant at the treachery the injustice the ingratitude of one man and at the very height of his resentment let him be soothed flattered courted by the offered friendship and favour of another let him personally despise the former and esteem the latter and let him above all be convinced as well as persuaded of the truth of vincents remark viz that no sacrifice of principle nor of measures was requirednothing but an alliance against men not measures and who were those men bound to me by a single tiemeriting from my gratitude a single consideration no the men above all others who had offered me the greatest affront and deserved from me the smallest esteem but however human feelings might induce me to waver i felt that it was not by them only i was to decide i am not a man whose vices or virtues are regulated by the impulse and passion of the moment if i am quick to act i am habitually slow to deliberate i turned to vincent and pressed his hand i dare not trust myself to answer you now said i give me till tomorrow i shall then have both considered and determined i did not wait for his reply i sprung from him turned down the passage which leads to pall mall and hastened home once more to commune with my own heart andnot to be still in these confessions i have made no scruple of owning my errors and my foibles all that could occasion mirth or benefit to the reader were his own i have kept a veil over the darker and stormier emotions of my soul all that could neither amuse nor instruct him are mine hours passed onit became time to dressi rung for bedosdressed with my usual elaborateness of painsgreat emotions interfere little with the mechanical operations of lifeand drove to gulosetons he was unusually entertaining the dinner too was unusually good but thinking that i was sufficiently intimate with my host not to be obliged to belie my feelings i remained distrait absent and dull what is the matter with you my friend said the good natured epicure you have neither applauded my jokes nor tasted my escallopes and your behaviour has trifled alike with my chevreuil and my feelings the proverb is right in saying grief is communicative i confess that i was eager to unbosom myself to one upon whose confidence i could depend guloseton heard me with great attention and interestlittle said he kindly little as i care for these matters myself i can feel for those who do i wish i could serve you better than by advice however you cannot i imagine hesitate to accept vincents offer what matters it whether you sit on one bench or on another so that you do not sit in a thorough draughtor dine at lord lincolns or lord dawtons so long as the cooks are equally good as for dawton i always thought him a shuffling mean fellow who buys his wines at the second price and sells his offices at the first come my dear fellow let us drink to his confusion so saying guloseton filled my glass to the brim he had sympathized with mei thought it therefore my duty to sympathize with him nor did we part till the eyes of the bon vivant saw more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the philosophy of the sober </chapter> </volume>

<chapter>chapter lxxiii si ad honestatem nati sumus ea aut sola expetenda est aut certe omni pondere gravior est habenda quam reliqua omniatully cas brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and shew of love as i was wont to havejulius caesar i rose at my usual early hour sleep had tended to calm and i hope also to better my feelings i had now leisure to reflect that i had not embraced my party from any private or interested motive it was not therefore from a private or interested motive that i was justified in deserting it our passions are terrible sophists when vincent had told me the day before that it was from men not measures that i was to change and that such a change could scarcely deserve the name my heart adopted the assertion and fancied it into truth i now began to perceive the delusion were government as mechanically perfect as it has never yet been but as i trust it may yet be it would signify little who were the mere machines that regulated its springs but in a constitution like ours the chief character of whichpardon me ye de lolmitesis its uncertainty where men invariably make the measures square to the dimensions of their own talent or desire and where reversing the maxim of the tailor the measures so rarely make the men it required no penetration to see how dangerous it was to entrust to the aristocratic prejudice of lincoln or the vehement imbecility of lesborough the execution of the very same measures which might safely be committed to the plain sense of dawton and above all to the great and various talents of his coadjutors but what made the vital difference between the two parties was less in the leaders than the body in the dawton faction the best the purest the wisest of the day were enrolled they took upon themselves the origin of all the active measures and lord dawton was the mere channel through which those measures flowed the plain the unpretending and somewhat feeble character of lord dawtons mind readily conceded to the abler components of his party the authority it was so desirable that they should exert in vincents party with the exception of himself there was scarcely an individual with the honesty requisite for loving the projects they affected to propose or the talents that were necessary for carrying them into effect even were their wishes sincere nor were either the haughty lincoln or his noisy and overbearing companion lesborough at all of a temper to suffer that quiet yet powerful interference of others to which dawton unhesitatingly submitted i was the more resolved to do all possible justice to dawtons party from the inclination i naturally had to lean towards the other and in all matters where private pique or selfinterest can possibly penetrate it </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> it has ever been the object of my maturer consideration to direct my particular attention to that side of the question which such undue partizans are the least likely to espouse while i was gradually but clearly feeling my way to a decision i received the following note from guloseton i said nothing to you last night of what is now to be the subject of my letter lest you should suppose it arose rather from the heat of an extempore conviviality than its real source viz a sincere esteem for your mind a sincere affection for your heart and a sincere sympathy in your resentment and your interest they tell me that lord dawtons triumph or discomfiture rests entirely upon the success of the motion upon brought before the house of commons on the i care you know very little for my own part which way this question is decided do not think therefore that i make any sacrifice when i request you to suffer me to follow your advice in the disposal of my four votes i imagine of course that you would wish them to adopt the contrary side to lord dawton and upon receiving a line from you to that effect they shall be empowered to do so pray oblige me also by taking the merit of this measure upon yourself and saying wherever it may be useful to you how entirely both the voters and their influence are at your disposal i trust we shall yet play the bel to this dragon and fell him from his high places pity me my dear friend i dine out today and feel already by an intuitive shudder that the soup will be cold and the sherry hot adieu ever yours guloseton now then my triumph my vanity and my revenge might be fully gratified i had before me a golden opportunity of displaying my own power and of humbling that of the minister my heart swelled high at the thought let it be forgiven me if for a single moment my previous calculations and morality vanished from my mind and i saw only the offer of vincent and the generosity of guloseton but i checked the risings of my heart and compelled my proud spirit to obedience i placed gulosetons letter before me and as i read it once more in order to reply to it the disinterested kindness and delicacy of one whom i had long in the injustice of my thoughts censured as selfish came over me so forcibly and contrasted so deeply with the hollowness of friends more sounding alike in their profession and their creeds that the tears streamed fast and gushingly from my eyes a thousand misfortunes are less affecting than a single kindness i wrote in answer a warm and earnest letter of thanks for an offer the judicious kindness of which penetrated me to the soul i detailed at some length the reasons which induced me to the decision i had taken i sketched also the nature of the very important motion about to be brought before the house and deduced from that sketch the impossibility of conscientiously opposing lord dawtons party in the debate i concluded with repeating the expressions my gratitude suggested and after declining all interference with lord gulosetons votes ventured to add that had i interfered it would have been in support of dawton not as a man but a ministernot as an individual friend but a public servant i had just despatched this letter when vincent entered i acquainted him though in the most respectful and friendly terms with my determination he seemed greatly disappointed and endeavoured to shake my resolution finding this was in vain he appeared at last satisfied and even affected with my reasons when we parted it was with a promise confirmed by both that no public variance should ever again alter our private opinions of each other when i was once more alone and saw myself brought back to the very foot of the ladder i had so far and so fortunately climbed when i saw that in rejecting all the overtures of my friends i was left utterly solitary and unaided among my foeswhen i looked beyond and saw no faint loophole of hope no single steppingstone on which to recommence my broken but unwearied careerperhaps one pang of regret and repentance at my determination came across me but there is something marvellously restorative in a good conscience and one soon learns to look with hope to the future when one can feel justified in turning with pride to the past my horse came to the door at my usual hour for riding with what gladness i sprung upon his back felt the free wind freshening over my fevered cheek and turned my rein towards the green lanes that border the great city on its western side i know few counsellors more exhilarating than a spirited horse i do not wonder that the roman emperor made a consul of his steed on horseback i always best feel my powers and survey my resources on horseback i always originate my noblest schemes and plan their ablest execution give me but a light rein and a free bound and i am cicerocatocaesar dismount me and i become a mere clod of the earth which you condemn me to touch fire energy etheriality have departed i am the soil without the sunthe cask without the winethe garments without the man i returned home with increased spirits and collected thoughts i urged my mind from my own situation and suffered it to rest upon what lady roseville had told me of reginald glanvilles interference in my behalf that extraordinary man still continued powerfully to excite my interest nor could i dwell without some yearning of the kindlier affections upon his unsolicited and but for lady rosevilles communication unknown exertions in my cause although the officers of justice were still actively employed in the pursuit of tyrrells murderer and although the newspapers were still full of speculations on their indifferent success public curiosity had began to flag upon the inquiry i had once or twice been in glanvilles company when the murder was brought upon the tapis and narrowly examined his behaviour upon a subject which touched him so fearfully i could not however note any extraordinary confusion or change in his countenance perhaps the pale cheek grew somewhat paler the dreaming eye more abstracted and the absent spirit more wandering than before but many other causes than guilt could account for signs so doubtful and minute you shall soon know all the last words which he had addressed to me yet rang in my ears and most intensely did i anticipate the fulfilment of this promise my hopes toothose flatterers so often the pleasing antitheses of reason whispered that this was not the pledge of a guilty man and yet he had said to lady roseville that he did not wonder at my estrangement from him such words seemed to require a less favourable construction than those he had addressed to me and in making this mental remark another of no flattering nature to glanvilles disinterestedness suggested itself might not his interference for me with lord dawton arise rather from policy than friendship might it not occur to him if as i surmised he was acquainted with my suspicions and acknowledged their dreadful justice that it would be advisable to propitiate my silence such were among the thousand thoughts which flashed across me and left my speculations in debate and doubt nor did my reflections pass unnoticed the nature of lady rosevilles affection for glanville from the seeming coldness and austerity of sir reginalds temperament it was likely that this was innocent at least in act and there was also something guileless in the manner in which she appeared rather to exult in than to conceal her attachment true that she was bound to no ties she had neither husband nor children for whose sake love became a crime free and unfettered if she gave her heart to glanville it was also allowable to render the gift lawful and perpetual by the blessing of the church alas how little can woman shut up in her narrow and limited circle of duties know of the wandering life and various actions of her lover little indeed could lady roseville when in the heat of her enthusiasm she spoke of the lofty and generous character of glanville dream of the foul and dastardly crime of which he was more than suspected nor while it was perhaps her fondest wish to ally herself to his destiny could her wildest fancies anticipate the felons fate which if death came not in an hastier and kinder shape must sooner or later await him of thornton i had neither seen nor heard aught since my departure from lord chesters that reprieve was however shortly to expire i had scarcely got into oxfordstreet in my way homeward when i perceived him crossing the street with another man i turned round to scrutinize the features of his companion and in spite of a great change of dress a huge pair of false whiskers and an artificial appearance of increased age my habit of observing countenances enabled me to recognize on the instant my intellectual and virtuous friend mr job jonson they disappeared in a shop nor did i think it worth while further to observe them though i still bore a reminiscetory spite against mr job jonson which i was fully resolved to wreak at the first favourable opportunity i passed by lady rosevilles door though the hour was late and i had therefore but a slight chance of finding her at home yet i thought the chance worth the trouble of inquiry to my agreeable surprise i was admitted no one was in the drawingroom the servant said lady roseville was at that moment engaged but would very shortly see me and begged i would wait agitated as i was by various reflections i walked in the restlessness of my mood to and fro the spacious rooms which formed lady rosevilles apartments of reception at the far end was a small boudoir where none but the goddesss favoured few were admitted as i approached towards it </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> it i heard voices and the next moment recognised the deep tones of glanville i turned hastily away lest i should overhear the discourse but i had scarcely got three steps when the convulsed sound of a womans sob came upon my ear shortly afterwards steps descended the stairs and the street door opened the minutes rolled on and i became impatient the servant reenteredlady roseville was so suddenly and seriously indisposed that she was unable to see me i left the house and full of bewildered conjectures returned to my apartments the next day was one of the most important in my life i was standing wistfully by my fireplace listening to a brokenwinded hurdygurdy with the most mournful attention stationed opposite to my window when bedos announced sir reginald glanville it so happened that i had that morning taken the miniature i had found in the fatal field from the secret place in which i usually kept it in order more closely to examine it lest any more convincing proof of its owner than the initials and thorntons interpretation might be discovered by a minuter investigation the picture was lying on the table when glanville entered my first impulse was to seize and secrete it my second to suffer it to remain and to watch the effect the sight of it might produce in following the latter i thought it however as well to choose my own time for discovering the miniature and as i moved to the table i threw my handkerchief carelessly over it glanville came up to me at once and his countenance usually close and reserved in its expression assumed a franker and bolder aspect you have lately changed towards me he saidmindful of our former friendship i have come to demand the reason can sir reginald glanvilles memory answered i supply him with no probable cause it can replied glanville but i would not trust only to that sit down pelham and listen to me i can read your thoughts and i might affect to despise their importperhaps two years since i shouldat present i can pity and excuse them i have come to you now in the love and confidence of our early days to claim as then your good opinion and esteem if you require any explanation at my hands it shall be given my days are approaching their end i have made up my accounts with othersi would do so with you i confess that i would fain leave behind me in your breast the same affectionate remembrance i might heretofore have claimed and which whatever be your suspicions i have done nothing to forfeit i have moreover a dearer interest than my own to consult in this wishyou colour pelhamyou know to whom i allude for my sisters sake if not for my own you will hear me glanville paused for a moment i raised the handkerchief from the miniaturei pushed the latter towards himdo you remember this said i in a low tone with a wild cry which thrilled through my heart glanville sprung forward and seized it he gazed eagerly and intensely upon it and his cheek flushedhis eyes sparkledhis breast heaved the next moment he fell back in his chair in one of the half swoons to which upon any sudden and violent emotion the debilitating effects of his disease subjected him before i could come to his assistance he had recovered he looked wildly and fiercely upon me speak he cried speakwhere got you thiswhereanswer for mercys sake recollect yourself said i sternly i found that token of your presence upon the spot where tyrrell was murdered true true said glanville slowly and in an absent and abstracted tone he ceased abruptly and covered his face with his hands from this attitude he started with some sudden impulse and tell me he said in a low inward exulting tone was itwas it red with the blood of the murdered man wretch i exclaimed do you glory in your guilt hold said glanville rising with an altered and haughty air it is not to your accusations that i am now to listen if you are yet desirous of weighing their justice before you decide upon them you will have the opportunity i shall be at home at ten this night come to me and you shall know all at present the sight of this picture has unnerved me shall i see you i made no other rejoinder than the brief expression of my assent and glanville instantly left the room during the whole of that day my mind was wrought up into a state of feverish and preternatural excitation i could not remain in the same spot for an instant my pulse beat with the irregularity of delirium for the last hour i placed my watch before me and kept my eyes constantly fixed upon it should any one think this exaggerated let him remember that it was not only glanvilles confession that i was to hear my own fate my future connection with ellen rested upon the story of that night for myself when i called to mind glanvilles acknowledgment of the picture and his slow and involuntary remembrance of the spot where it was found i scarcely allowed my temper sanguine as it was to hope some minutes before the hour of ten i repaired to glanvilles house he was alonethe picture was before him i drew my chair towards him in silence and accidentally lifting up my eyes encountered the opposite mirror i started at my own face the intensity and fearfulness of my interest had rendered it even more hueless than that of my companion there was a pause for some moments at the end of which glanville thus began </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxiv i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed me quick and dark the grave is yawningas its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this grief julian and maddalo with thee the very future fled i stand amid the past alone a tomb which still shall guard the dead tho every earthlier trace be flown a tomb oer which the weeds that love decaytheir wild luxuriance wreathe the cold and callous stone aboveand only thou and death beneath from unpublished poems by the history of sir reginald glanville you remember my character at schoolthe difficulty with which you drew me from the visionary and abstracted loneliness which even at that time was more consonant to my taste than all the sports and society resorted to by other boysand the deep and to you inexplicable delight with which i returned to my reveries and solitude again that character has continued through life the same circumstances have strengthened not altered it so has it been with you the temper the habits the tastes so strongly contrasted with mine in boyhood have lost nothing of that contrast your ardour for the various ambition of life is still the antipodes to my indifference your daring restless thoughtful resolution in the pursuit still shames my indolence and abstraction you are still the votary of the world but will become its conquerori its fugitiveand shall die its victim after we parted at school i went for a short time to a tutors inshire of this place i soon grew weary and my fathers death leaving me in a great measure at my own disposal i lost no time in leaving it i was seized with that mania for travel common enough to all persons of my youth and disposition my mother allowed me an almost unlimited command over the fortune hereafter to be my own and yielding to my wishes rather than her fears she suffered me at the age of eighteen to set out for the continent alone perhaps the quiet and reserve of my character made her think me less exposed to the dangers of youth than if i had been of a more active and versatile temper this is no uncommon mistake a serious and contemplative disposition is however often the worst formed to acquire readily the knowledge of the world and always the most calculated to suffer deeply from the experience i took up my residence for some time at spa it is you know perhaps a place dull enough to make gambling the only amusement every one playedand i did not escape the contagion nor did i wish it for like the minister godolphin i loved gaming for its own sake because it was a substitute for conversation this habit brought me acquainted with mr tyrrell who was then staying at spa he had not at that time quite dissipated his fortune but was daily progressing to so desirable a consummation a gamblers acquaintance is readily made and easily kept provided you gamble too we became as intimate as the reserve of my habits ever suffered me to become with any one but you he was many years older than mehad seen a great deal of the worldhad mixed much in its best societies and at that time whatever was the grossierete of his mind had little of the coarseness of manner which very soon afterwards distinguished him evil communication works rapidly in its results our acquaintance was therefore natural enough especially when it is considered that my purse was entirely at his disposalfor borrowing is twice blessed in him that takes and him that givesthe receiver becomes complaisant and conceding and the lender thinks favourably of one he has obliged we parted at spa under a mutual promise to write i forget if this promise was keptprobably not we were not however the worse friends for being bad correspondents i continued my travels for about another year i then returned to england the same melancholy and dreaming enthusiast as before it is true that we are the creatures of circumstances but circumstances are also in a great measure the creatures of us i mean they receive their colour from the previous bent of our own minds what raises one would depress another and what vitiates my neighbour might correct me thus the experience of the world makes some persons more worldlyothers more abstracted and the indulgence of the </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> the senses becomes a violence to one mind and a second nature to another as for me i had tasted all the pleasures youth and opulence can purchase and was more averse to them than ever i had mixed with many varieties of meni was still more rivetted to the monotony of self i cannot hope while i mention these peculiarities that i am a very uncommon character i believe the present age has produced many such some time hence it will be a curious inquiry to ascertain the causes of that acute and sensitive morbidity of mind which has been and still is so epidemic a disease you know me well enough to believe that i am not fond of the cant of assuming an artificial character or of creating a fictitious interest and i am far from wishing to impose upon you a malady of constitution for a dignity of mind you must pardon my prolixity i own that it is very painful to me to come to the main part of my confessions and i am endeavouring to prepare myself by lingering over the prelude glanville paused here for a few moments in spite of the sententious coolness with which he pretended to speak i saw that he was powerfully and painfully affected well he continued to resume the thread of my narrative after i had stayed some weeks with my mother and sister i took advantage of their departure for the continent and resolved to make a tour through england rich people and i have always been very rich get exceedingly tired of the embarrassment of their riches i seized with delight at the idea of travelling without carriages and servants i took merely a favourite horse and the black dog poor terror which you see now at my feet the day i commenced this plan was to me the epoch of a new and terrible existence however you must pardon me if i am not here sufficiently diffuse suffice it that i became acquainted with a being whom for the first and only time in my life i loved this miniature attempts to express her likeness the initials at the back interwoven with my own are hers yes said i incautiously they are the initials of gertrude douglas what cried glanville in a loud tone which he instantly checked and continued in an indrawn muttered whisper how long is it since i heard that name and nownow he broke off abruptly and then said with a calmer voice i know not how you have learnt her name perhaps you will explain from thornton said i and has he told you more cried glanville as if gasping for breaththe historythe dreadful not a word said i hastily he was with me when i found the picture and he explained the initials it is well answered glanville recovering himself you will see presently if i have reason to love that those foul and sordid lips should profane the story i am about to relate gertrude was an only daughter though of gentle blood she was no match for me either in rank or fortune did i say just now that the world had not altered me see my folly one year before i saw her and i should not have thought her but myself honoured by a marriagetwelve little months had sufficed togod forgive me i took advantage of her loveher youthher innocenceshe fled with mebut not to the altar again glanville paused and again by a violent effort conquered his emotion and proceeded never let vice be done by halvesnever let a man invest all his purer affections in the woman he ruinsnever let him cherish the kindness if he gratifies the selfishness of his heart a profligate who really loves his victim is one of the most wretched of beings in spite of my successful and triumphant passionin spite of the delirium of the first intoxication of possession and of the better and deeper delight of a reciprocity of thoughtfeeling sympathy for the first time foundin the midst of all the luxuries my wealth could produce and of the voluptuous and springlike hues with which youth health and first love clothe the earth which the loved one treads and the air which she inhales in spite of these in spite of all i was any thing but happy if gertrudes cheek seemed a shade more pale or her eye less bright i remembered the sacrifice she had made me and believed that she felt it too it was in vain that with a tender and generous devotionnever found but in womanshe assured me that my love was a recompense for all the more touching was her tenderness the more poignant my remorse i never loved but her i have never therefore entered into the commonplace of passion and i cannot even to this day look upon her sex as ours do in general i thought i think so still that ingratitude to a woman is often a more odious offencei am sure it contains a more painful penaltythan ingratitude to a man but enough of this if you know me you can penetrate the nature of my feelingsif not it is in vain to expect your sympathy i never loved living long in one place we travelled over the greater part of england and france what must be the enchantment of love when accompanied with innocence and joy when even in sin in remorse in grief it brings us a rapture to which all other things are tame oh those were moments steeped in the very elixir of life overflowing with the hoarded fondness and sympathies of hearts too full for words and yet too agitated for silence when we journeyed alone and at night and as the shadows and stillness of the waning hours gathered round us drew closer to each other and concentrated this breathing world in the deep and embracing sentiment of our mutual love it was then that i laid my burning temples on her bosom and felt while my hand clasped hers that my visions were realized and my wandering spirit had sunk unto its rest i remember well that one night we were travelling through one of the most beautiful parts of england it was in the very height and flush of summer and the moon what scene of lovewhether in reality or romancehas any thing of tenderness or passion or divinity where her light is not filled the intense skies of june with her presence and cast a sadder and paler beauty over gertrudes cheek she was always of a melancholy and despondent temper perhaps for that reason she was more congenial to my own and when i gazed upon her that night i was not surprised to see her eyes filled with tears you will laugh at me she said as i kissed them off and inquired into the cause but i feel a presentiment that i cannot shake off it tells me that you will travel this road again before many months are past and that i shall not be with you perhaps not upon the earth she was right in all her foreboding but the suggestion of her deaththat came later we took up our residence for some time at a beautiful situation a short distance from a small watering place here to my great surprise i met with tyrrell he had come there partly to see a relation from whom he had some expectations and partly to recruit his health which was much broken by his irregularities and excesses i could not refuse to renew my old acquaintance with him and indeed i thought him too much of a man of the world and of society to feel with him that particular delicacy in regard to gertrude which made me in general shun all intercourse with my former friends he was in great pecuniary embarrassmentmuch more deeply so than i then imagined for i believed the embarrassment to be only temporary however my purse was then as before at his disposal and he did not scruple to avail himself very largely of my offers he came frequently to our house and poor gertrude who thought i had for her sake made a real sacrifice in renouncing my acquaintance endeavoured to conquer her usual diffidence and that more painful feeling than diffidence natural to her station and even to affect a pleasure in the society of my friend which she was very far from feeling i was detained atfor several weeks by gertrudes confinement the childhappy beingdied a week after its birth gertrude was still in bed and unable to leave it when i received a letter from ellen to say that my mother was then staying at toulouse and dangerously ill if i wished once more to see her ellen besought me to lose no time in setting off for the continent you may imagine my situation or rather you cannot for you cannot conceive the smallest particle of that intense love i bore to gertrude to youto any other man it might seem no extraordinary hardship to leave her even for an uncertain periodto me it was like tearing away the very life from my heart i procured her a sort of half companion and half nurse i provided for her every thing that the most anxious and fearful love could suggest and with a mind full of forebodings too darkly to be realized hereafter i hastened to the nearest seaport and set sail for france when i arrived at toulouse my mother was much better but still in a very uncertain and dangerous state of health i stayed with her for more than a month during which time every post brought me a line from gertrude and bore back a message from my heart to hers in return this was no mean consolation more especially when each letter spoke of increasing health and strength at the months end i was preparing to returnmy mother was slowly recovering and i no longer had any fears on her account but there are links in our destiny fearfully interwoven with each other and ending only in the anguish of our ultimate doom the day before that fixed for my departure </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> departure i had been into a house where an epidemic disease raged that night i complained of oppressive and deadly illnessbefore morning i was in a high fever during the time i was sensible of my state i wrote constantly to gertrude and carefully concealed my illness but for several days i was delirious when i recovered i called eagerly for my lettersthere were nonenone i could not believe i was yet awake but days still passed on and not a line from englandfrom gertrude the instant i was able i insisted upon putting horses to my carriage i could bear no longer the torture of my suspense by the most rapid journeys my debility would allow me to bear i arrived in england i travelled down toby the same road that i had gone over with her the words of her foreboding at that time sunk like ice into my heart you will travel this road again before many months are past and i shall not be with you perhaps i shall not be upon the earth at that thought i could have called unto the grave to open for me her unaccountable and lengthened silence in spite of all the urgency and entreaties of my letters for a reply filled me with presentiments the most fearful oh godoh god they were nothing to the truth at last i arrived at my carriage stopped at the very housemy whole frame was perfectly frozen with dreadi trembled from limb to limbthe ice of a thousand winters seemed curdling through my blood the bell rungonce twiceno answer i would have leaped out of the carriagei would have forced an entrance but i was unable to move a man fettered and spellbound by an incubus is less helpless than i was at last an old female i had never seen before appeared where is she how i could utter no moremy eyes were fixed upon the inquisitive and frightened countenance opposite to my own those eyes i thought might have said all that my lips could not i was deceivedthe old woman understood me no more than i did her another person appearedi recognized the faceit was that of a girl who had been one of our attendants will you believe that at that sight the sight of one i had seen before and could associate with the remembrance of the breathing the living the present gertrude a thrill of joy flashed across memy fears seemed to vanishmy spell to cease i sprung from the carriage i caught the girl by the robe your mistress said i your mistressshe is wellshe is alivespeak speak the girl shrieked out my eagerness and perhaps my emaciated and altered appearance terrified her but she had the strong nerves of youth and was soon reassured she requested me to step in and she would tell me all my wife gertrude always went by that name was alive and she believed well but she had left that place some weeks since trembling and still fearful but comparatively in heaven to my former agony i followed the girl and the old woman into the house the former got me some water now said i when i had drank a long and hearty draught i am ready to hear allmy wife has left this house you sayfor what place the girl hesitated and looked down the old woman who was somewhat deaf and did not rightly understand my questions or the nature of the personal interest i had in the reply answeredwhat does the gentleman want the poor young lady who was last here lord help her what of her i called out in a new alarm what of her where has she gone who took her away who took her mumbled the old woman fretful at my impatient tone who took her why the mad doctor to be sure i heard no more my frame could support no longer the agonies my mind had undergone i fell lifeless on the ground when i recovered it was in the dead of night i was in bed the old woman and the girl were at my side i rose slowly and calmly you know all men who have ever suffered much know the strange anomalies of despairthe quiet of our veriest anguish deceived by my bearing i learned by degrees from my attendants that gertrude had some weeks since betrayed sudden symptoms of insanity that these in a very few hours arose to an alarming pitchfrom some reason the woman could not explain she had a short time before discarded the companion i had left with her she was therefore alone among servants they sent for the ignorant practitioners of the place they tried their nostrums without success her madness increased her attendants with that superstitious horror of insanity common to the lower classes became more and more violently alarmed the landlady insisted on her removal andandi told you pehami told youthey sent her awaysent her to a madhouse all this i listened toallaye and patiently i noted down the address of her present abode it was about the distance of twenty miles from i ordered fresh horses and set off immediately i arrived there at daybreak it was a large old house which like a french hotel seemed to have no visible door dark and gloomy the pile appeared worthy of the purpose to which it was devoted it was a long time before we aroused any one to answer our call at length i was ushered into a small parlourhow minutely i remember every article in the room what varieties there are in the extreme passions sometimes the same feeling will deaden all the sensessometimes render them a hundred fold more acute at last a man of a smiling and rosy aspect appeared he pointed to a chairrubbed his handsand begged me to unfold my business few words sufficed to do that i requested to see his patient i demanded by what authority she had been put under his care the mans face altered he was but little pleased with the nature of my visit the lady he said coolly had been entrusted to his care with an adequate remuneration by mr tyrrell without that gentlemans permission he could not think even of suffering me to see her i controlled my passion i knew something if not of the nature of private madhouses at least of that of mankind i claimed his patient as my wife i expressed myself obliged by his care and begged his acceptance of a further remuneration which i tendered and which was eagerly accepted the way was now clearedthere is no hell to which a golden branch will not win your admittance the man detained me no longer he hastened to lead the way we passed through various long passages sometimes the low moan of pain and weakness came upon my earsometimes the confused murmur of the idiots drivelling soliloquy from one passage at right angles with the one through which we proceeded came a fierce and thrilling shriek it sunk at once into silenceperhaps by the lash we were now in a different department of the buildingall was silencehushed deepbreathless this seemed to me more awful than the terrible sounds i had just heard my guide went slowly on sometimes breaking the stillness of the dim gallery by the jingle of his keyssometimes by a muttered panegyric on himself and his humanity i neither heeded nor answered him we read in the annals of the inquisition of every limb nerve sinew of the victim being so nicely and accurately strained to their utmost that the frame would not bear the additional screwing of a single hair breadth such seemed my state we came to a small door at the right hand it was the last but one in the passage we paused before it stop said i for one moment and i was so faint and sick at heart that i leaned against the wall to recover myself before i let him open the door when he did it was a greater relief than i can express to see that all was utterly dark wait sir said the guide as he entered and a sullen noise told me that he was unbarring the heavy shutter slowly the grey cold light of the morning broke in a dark figure was stretched upon a wretched bed at the far end of the room she raised herself at the sound she turned her face towards me i did not fall nor faint nor shriek i stood motionless as if fixed into stone and yet it was gertrude upon whom i gazed oh heaven who but myself could have recognized her her cheek was as the cheek of the deadthe hueless skin clung to the bonethe eye was dull and glassy for one moment the next it became terribly and preternaturally brightbut not with the ray of intellect or consciousness or recognition she looked long and hard at me a voice hollow and broken but which still penetrated my heart came forth through the wan lips that scarcely moved with the exertion i am very cold it saidbut if i complain you will beat me she fell down again upon the bed and hid her face my guide who was leaning carelessly by the window turned to me with a sort of smirkthis is her way sir he said her madness is of a very singular description we have not as yet been able to discover how far it extends sometimes she seems conscious of the past sometimes utterly oblivious of every thing for days she is perfectly silent or at least says nothing more than you have just heard but at times she raves so violently thatthatbut i never use force where it can be helped i looked at the man but i could not answer unless i had torn him to pieces on the spot i turned away hastily from the room but i did not quit the house without gertrudei placed her in the carriage by my sidenotwithstanding all the protestations and fears of the keeper these were readily silenced by the sum i gave him it was large enough to have liberated half his household in fact </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> fact i gathered from his conversation that tyrrell had spoken of gertrude as an unhappy female whom he himself had seduced and would now be rid of i thank you pelham for that frown but keep your indignation till a fitter season for it i took my victim for i then regarded her as such to a secluded and lonely spot i procured for her whatever advice england could afford all was in vain night and day i was by her side but she never for a moment seemed to recollect me yet were there times of fierce and overpowering delirium when my name was uttered in the transport of the most passionate enthusiasmwhen my features as absent though not present were recalled and dwelt upon with all the minuteness of the most faithful detail and i knelt by her in all those moments when no other human being was near and clasped her wan hand and wiped the dew from her forehead and gazed upon her convulsed and changing face and called upon her in a voice which could once have allayed her wildest emotions and had the agony of seeing her eye dwell upon me with the most estranged indifference and the most vehement and fearful aversion but ever and anon she uttered words which chilled the very marrow of my bones words which i would not dared not believe had any meaning or method in their madnessbut which entered into my own brain and preyed there like the devouring of a fire there was a truth in those ravingsa reason in that incoherenceand my cup was not yet full at last one physician who appeared to me to have more knowledge than the rest of the mysterious workings of her dreadful disease advised me to take her to the scenes of her first childhood those scenes said he justly are in all stages of life the most fondly remembered and i have noted that in many cases of insanity places are easier recalled than persons perhaps if we can once awaken one link in the chain it will communicate to the rest i took this advice and set off to norfolk her early home was not many miles distant from the churchyard where you once met me and in that churchyard her mother was buried she had died before gertrudes flight the fathers death had followed it perhaps my sufferings were a just retribution the house had gone into other hands and i had no difficulty in engaging it thank heaven i was spared the pain of seeing any of gertrudes relations it was night when we moved to the house i had placed within the room where she used to sleep all the furniture and books with which it appeared from my inquiries to have been formerly filled we laid her in the bed that had held that faded and altered form in its freshest and purest years i shrouded myself in one corner of the room and counted the dull minutes till the daylight dawned i pass over the detail of my recitalthe experiment partially succeededwould to god that it had not would that she had gone down to her grave with her dreadful secret unrevealed wouldbut here glanvilles voice failed him and there was a brief silence before he recommenced gertrude now had many lucid intervals but these my presence were always sufficient to change into a delirious raving even more incoherent than her insanity had ever yet been she would fly from me with the most fearful cries bury her face in her hands and seem like one oppressed and haunted by a supernatural visitation as long as i remained in the room the moment i left her she began though slowly to recover this was to me the bitterest affliction of allto be forbidden to nurse to cherish to tend her was like taking from me my last hope but little can the thoughtless or the worldly dream of the depths of a real love i used to wait all day by her door and it was luxury enough to me to catch her accents or hear her move or sigh or even weep and all night when she could not know of my presence i used to lie down by her bedside and when i sank into a short and convulsed sleep i saw her once more in my brief and fleeting dreams in all the devoted love and glowing beauty which had once constituted the whole of my happiness and my world one day i had been called from my post by her door they came to me hastilyshe was in strong convulsions i flew up stairs and supported her in my arms till the fits had ceased we then placed her in bed she never rose from it again but on that bed of death the words as well as the cause of her former insanity were explainedthe mystery was unravelled it was a still and breathless night the moon which was at its decrease came through the halfclosed shutters and beneath its solemn and eternal light she yielded to my entreaties and revealed all the manmy friendtyrrellhad polluted her ear with his addresses and when forbidden the house had bribed the woman i had left with her to convey his lettersshe was dischargedbut tyrrell was no ordinary villain he entered the house one evening when no one but gertrude was therecome near me pelhamnearerbend down your earhe used force violence that night gertrudes senses deserted heryou know the rest the moment that i gathered from gertrudes broken sentences their meaning that moment the demon entered into my soul all human feelings seemed to fly from my heart it shrunk into one burning and thirsty and fiery wantthat was for revenge i would have sprung from the bedside but gertrudes hand clung to me and detained me the damp chill grasp grew colder and colderit ceasedthe hand felli turnedone slight but awful shudder went over that face made yet more wan by the light of the waning and ghastly moonone convulsion shook the limbsone murmur passed the falling and hueless lips i cannot tell you the restyou knowyou can guess it that day week we buried her in the lonely churchyardwhere she had in her lucid moments wished to lieby the side of her mother </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxv i breathed but not the breath of human life a serpent round my heart was wreathed and stung my very thought to strifethe giaour thank heaven the most painful part of my story is at an end you will now be able to account for our meeting in the churchyard at i secured myself a lodging at a cottage not far from the spot which held gertrudes remains night after night i wandered to that lonely place and longed for a couch beside the sleeper whom i mourned in the selfishness of my soul i prostrated myself on the mound i humbled myself to tears in the overflowing anguish of my heart i forgot all that had aroused its stormier passions into life revenge hatredall vanished i lifted up my face to the tender heavens i called aloud to the silent and placid air and when i turned again to the unconscious mound i thought of nothing but the sweetness of our early love and the bitterness of her early death it was in such moments that your footstep broke upon my grief the instant others had seen meother eyes had penetrated the sanctity of my regretfrom that instant whatever was more soft and holy in the passions and darkness of my mind seemed to vanish away like a scroll i again returned to the intense and withering remembrance which was henceforward to make the very key and pivot of my existence i again recalled the last night of gertrudes life i again shuddered at the low murmured sounds whose dreadful sense broke slowly upon my soul i again felt the coldcold slimy grasp of those wan and dying fingers and i again nerved my heart to an iron strength and vowed deep deeprooted endless implacable revenge the morning after the night you saw me i left my abode i went to london and attempted to methodize my plans of vengeance the first thing to discover was tyrrells present residence by accident i heard he was at paris and within two hours of receiving the intelligence i set off for that city on arriving there the habits of the gambler soon discovered him to my search i saw him one night at a hell he was evidently in distressed circumstances and the fortune of the table was against him unperceived by him i feasted my eyes on his changing countenance as those deadly and wearing transitions of feeling only to be produced by the gamingtable passed over it while i gazed upon him a thought of more exquisite and refined revenge than had yet occurred to me flashed upon my mind occupied with the ideas it gave rise to i went into the adjoining room which was quite empty there i seated myself and endeavoured to develop more fully the rude and imperfect outline of my scheme the arch tempter favoured me with a trusty coadjutor in my designs i was lost in a revery when i heard myself accosted by name i looked up and beheld a man whom i had often seen with tyrrell both at spa and the watering place where with gertrude i had met tyrrell he was a person of low birth and character but esteemed from his love of coarse humour and vulgar enterprise a man of infinite partsa sort of yorickby the set most congenial to tyrrells tastes by this undue reputation and the levelling habit of gaming to which he was addicted he was raised in certain societies much above his proper rank need i say that this man was thornton i was but slightly acquainted with him however he accosted me cordially and endeavoured to draw me into conversation have you seen tyrrell said he he is at it again whats bred in the bone you know etc i turned pale with the mention of tyrrells name and replied very laconically to what purpose i forget ah ah </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> ah rejoined thornton eying me with an air of impertinent familiarity i see you have not forgiven him he played you but a shabby trick at seduced your mistress or something of that sort he told me all about it pray how is the poor girl now i made no reply i sank down and gasped for breath all i had suffered seemed nothing to the indignity i then endured sheshewho had once been my pridemy honourlifeto be thus spoken ofand i could not pursue the idea i rose hastily looked at thornton with a glance which might have abashed a man less shameless and callous than himself and left the room that night as i tossed restless and feverish on my bed of thorns i saw how useful thornton might be to me in the prosecution of the scheme i had entered into and the next morning i sought him out and purchased no very difficult matter both his secrecy and his assistance my plan of vengeance to one who had seen and observed less of the varieties of human nature than you have done might seem farfetched and unnatural for while the superficial are ready to allow eccentricity as natural in the coolness of ordinary life they never suppose it can exist in the heat of the passionsas if in such moments anything was ever considered absurd in the means which was favourable to the end were the secrets of one passionate and irregulated heart laid bare there would be more romance in them than in all the fables which we turn from with incredulity and disdain as exaggerated and overdrawn among the thousand schemes for retribution which had chased each other across my mind the death of my victim was only the ulterior object death indeedthe pang of one momentappeared to me but very feeble justice for the life of lingering and restless anguish to which his treachery had condemned me but my penance my doom i could have forgiven it was the fate of a more innocent and injured being which irritated the sting and fed the venom of my revenge that revenge no ordinary punishment could appease if fanaticism can only be satisfied by the rack and the flames you may readily conceive a like unappeasable fury in a hatred so deadly so concentrated and so just as mine and if fanaticism persuades itself into a virtue so also did my hatred the scheme which i resolved upon was to attach tyrrell more and more to the gamingtable to be present at his infatuation to feast my eyes upon the feverish intensity of his suspense to reduce him step by step to the lowest abyss of poverty to glut my soul with the abjectness and humiliation of his penury to strip him of all aid consolation sympathy and friendship to follow him unseen to his wretched and squalid home to mark the struggles of the craving nature with the loathing pride and finally to watch the frame wear the eye sink the lip grow livid and all the terrible and torturing progress of gnawing want to utter starvation then in that last state but not before i might reveal myself stand by the hopeless and succourless bed of death shriek out in the dizzy ear a name which could treble the horrors of remembrance snatch from the struggling and agonizing conscience the last plank the last straw to which in its madness it could cling and blacken the shadows of departing life by opening to the shuddering sense the threshold of an impatient and yawning hell hurried away by the unhallowed fever of these projects i thought of nothing but their accomplishment i employed thornton who still maintained his intimacy with tyrrell to decoy him more and more to the gamblinghouse and as the unequal chances of the public table were not rapid enough in their termination to consummate the ruin even of an impetuous and vehement gamester like tyrrell so soon as my impatience desired thornton took every opportunity of engaging him in private play and accelerating my object by the unlawful arts of which he was master my enemy was every day approaching the farthest verge of ruin near relations he had noneall his distant ones he had disobliged all his friends and even his acquaintance he had fatigued by his importunity or disgusted by his conduct in the whole world there seemed not a being who would stretch forth a helping hand to save him from the total and penniless beggary to which he was hopelessly advancing out of the wrecks of his former property and the generosity of former friends whatever he had already wrung had been immediately staked at the gaminghouse and as immediately lost perhaps this would not so soon have been the case if thornton had not artfully fed and sustained his expectations he had been long employed by tyrrell in a professional capacity and he knew well all the gamesters domestic affairs and when he promised should things come to the worst to find some expedient to restore them tyrrell easily adopted so flattering a belief meanwhile i had taken the name and disguise under favour of which you met me at paris and thornton had introduced me to tyrrell as a young englishman of great wealth and still greater inexperience the gambler grasped eagerly at an acquaintance which thornton readily persuaded him he could turn to such account and i had thus every facility of marking day by day how my plot thickened and my vengeance hastened to its triumph this was not all i said there was not in the wide world a being who would have saved tyrrell from the fate he deserved and was approaching i forgot there was one who still clung to him with affection and for whom he still seemed to harbour the better and purer feelings of less degraded and guilty times this person you will guess readily it was a woman i made it my especial business and care to wean away from my prey i would not suffer him a consolation he had denied to me i used all the arts of seduction to obtain the transfer of her affections whatever promises and vowswhether of love or wealthcould effect were tried nor at last without success i triumphed the woman became my slave it was she who whenever tyrrell faltered in his course to destruction combated his scruples and urged on his reluctance it was she who informed me minutely of his pitiful finances and assisted to her utmost in expediting their decay the still more bitter treachery of deserting him in his veriest want i reserved till the fittest occasion and contemplated with a savage delight i was embarrassed in my scheme by two circumstances first thorntons acquaintance with you and secondly tyrrells receipt some time afterwards of a very unexpected sum of two hundred pounds in return for renouncing all further and possible claim on the purchasers of his estate to the former so far as it might interfere with my plans or lead to my detection you must pardon me for having put a speedy termination the latter threw me into great consternation for tyrrells first idea was to renounce the gamingtable and endeavour to live upon the trifling pittance he had acquired as long as the utmost economy would permit this idea margaret the woman i spoke of according to my instructions so artfully and successfully combated that tyrrell yielded to his natural inclination and returned once more to the infatuation of his favourite pursuit however i had become restlessly impatient for the conclusion to this prefatory part of my revenge and accordingly thornton and myself arranged that tyrrell should be persuaded by the former to risk all even to his very last farthing in a private game with me tyrrell who believed he should readily recruit himself by my unskilfulness in the game fell easily into the snare and on the second night of our engagement he not only had lost the whole of his remaining pittance but had signed bonds owning to a debt of far greater amount than he at that time could ever even have dreamt of possessing flushed heated almost maddened with my triumph i yielded to the exultation of the moment i did not know you were so neari discovered myselfyou remember the scene i went joyfully home and for the first time since gertrudes death i was happy but there i imagined my vengeance only would begin i revelled in the burning hope of marking the hunger and extremity that must ensue the next day when tyrrell turned round in his despair for one momentary word of comfort from the lips to which he believed in the fond credulity of his heart falsehood and treachery never came his last earthly friend taunted and deserted him mark me pelham i was by and heard her but here my power of retribution was to close from the thirst still unslaked and unappeased the cup was abruptly snatched tyrrell disappeared no one knew whither i set thorntons inquiries at work a week afterwards he brought me word that tyrrell had died in extreme want and from very despair will you credit that at hearing this news my first sensations were only rage and disappointment true he had died died in all the misery my heart could wish but i had not seen him die and the deathbed seemed to me robbed of its bitterest pang i know not to this day though i have often questioned him what interest thornton had in deceiving me by this tale for my own part i believe that he himself was deceived certain it is for i inquired that a person very much answering to tyrrells description had perished in the state thornton mentioned and this might therefore in all probability have misled him i left paris and returned through normandy to england where i remained some weeks there we again met but i think we did not meet till i had been persecuted by the insolence and importunity of thornton the tools of our passions cut both ways like the monarch who employed strange beasts in his army we find our treacherous allies less destructive to others </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> others than ourselves but i was not of a temper to brook the tauntings or the encroachment of my own creature it had been with but an ill grace that i had endured his familiarity when i absolutely required his services much less could i suffer his intrusion when those servicesservices not of love but hire were no longer necessary thornton like all persons of his stamp had a low pride which i was constantly offending he had mixed with men more than my equals in rank on a familiar footing and he could ill brook the hauteur with which my disgust at his character absolutely constrained me to treat him it is true that the profuseness of my liberality was such that the mean wretch stomached affronts for which he was so largely paid but with the cunning and malicious spite natural to him he knew well how to repay them in kind while he assisted he affected to ridicule my revenge and though he soon saw that he durst not for his very life breathe a syllable openly against gertrude or her memory yet he contrived by general remarks and covert insinuations to gall me to the very quick and in the very tenderest point thus a deep and cordial antipathy to each other arose and grew and strengthened till i believe like the fiends in hell our mutual hatred became our common punishment no sooner had i returned to england than i found him here awaiting my arrival he favoured me with frequent visits and requests for money although not possessed of any secret really important affecting my character he knew well that he was possessed of one important to my quiet and he availed himself to the utmost of my strong and deep aversion even to the most delicate recurrence to my love to gertrude and its unhallowed and disastrous termination at length however he wearied me i found that he was sinking into the very dregs and refuse of society and i could not longer brook the idea of enduring his familiarity and feeding his vices i pass over any detail of my own feelings as well as my outward and worldly history over my mind a great change had passed i was no longer torn by violent and contending passions upon the tumultuous sea a dead and heavy torpor had fallen the very winds necessary for health had ceasedi slept on the abyss without a surge one violent and engrossing passion is among the worst of all immoralities for it leaves the mind too stagnant and exhausted for those activities and energies which constitute our real duties however now that the tyrant feeling of my mind was removed i endeavoured to shake off the apathy it had produced and return to the various occupations and businesses of life whatever could divert me from my own dark memories or give a momentary motion to the stagnation of my mind i grasped at with the fondness and eagerness of a child thus you found me surrounding myself with luxuries which palled upon my taste the instant that their novelty had passed now striving for the vanity of literary fame now for the emptier baubles which riches could procure at one time i shrouded myself in my closet and brooded over the dogmas of the learned and the errors of the wise at another i plunged into the more engrossing and active pursuits of the living crowd which rolled around meand flattered my heart that amid the applause of senators and the whirlpool of affairs i could lull to rest the voices of the past and the spectre of the dead whether these hopes were effectual and the struggle not in vain this haggard and wasting form drooping day by day into the grave can declare but i said i would not dwell long upon this part of my history nor is it necessary of one thing only not connected with the main part of my confessions it is right for the sake of one tender and guiltless being that i should speak in the cold and friendless world with which i mixed there was a heart which had years ago given itself wholly up to me at that time i was ignorant of the gift i so little deserved or for it was before i knew gertrude i might have returned it and been saved years of crime and anguish since then the person i allude to had married and by the death of her husband was once more free intimate with my family and more especially with my sister she now met me constantly her compassion for the change she perceived in me both in mind and person was stronger than even her reserve and this is the only reason why i speak of an attachment which ought otherwise to be concealed i believe that you already understand to whom i allude and since you have discovered her weakness it is right that you should know also her virtue it is right that you should learn that it was not in her the fantasy or passion of a moment but a long and secreted love that you should learn that it was her pity and no unfeminine disregard to opinion which betrayed her into imprudence and that she is at this moment innocent of everything but the folly of loving me i pass on to the time when i discovered that i had been either intentionally or unconsciously deceived and that my enemy yet lived lived in honour prosperity and the worlds blessings the information was like removing a barrier from a stream hitherto pent into quiet and restraint all the stormy thoughts feelings and passions so long at rest rushed again into a terrible and tumultuous action the newlyformed stratum of my mind was swept away everything seemed a wreck a chaos a convulsion of jarring elements but this is a trite and tame description of my feelings words would be but commonplace to express the revulsion which i experienced yet amidst all there was one paramount and presiding thought to which the rest were as atoms in the heapthe awakened thought of vengeancebut how was it to be gratified placed as tyrrell now was in the scale of society every method of retribution but the one formerly rejected seemed at an end to that one therefore weak and merciful as it appeared to me i resorted you took my challenge to tyrrell you remember his behaviour conscience doth indeed make cowards of us all the letter enclosed to me in his to you contained only the commonplace argument urged so often by those who have injured us namely the reluctance at attempting our life after having ruined our happiness when i found that he had left london my rage knew no bounds i was absolutely frantic with indignation the earth reeled before my eyes i was almost suffocated by the violencethe whirlpoolof my emotions i gave myself no time to thinki left town in pursuit of my foe i found thatstill addicted though i believed not so madly as before to the old amusementshe was in the neighbourhood of newmarket awaiting the races shortly to ensue no sooner did i find his address than i wrote him another challenge still more forcibly and insultingly worded than the one you took in this i said that his refusal was of no avail that i had sworn that my vengeance should overtake him and that sooner or later in the face of heaven and despite of hell my oath should be fulfilled remember those words pelham i shall refer to them hereafter tyrrells reply was short and contemptuous he affected to treat me as a madman perhaps and i confess that the incoherence of my letter authorized such suspicion he believed i really was one he concluded by saying that if he received more of my letters he should shelter himself from my aggressions by the protection of the law on receiving this reply a stern sullen iron spirit entered into my bosom i betrayed no external mark of passion i sat down in silence i placed the letter and gertrudes picture before me there still and motionless i remained for hours i remember well i was awakened from my gloomy revery by the clock as it struck the first hour of the morning at that lone and ominous sound the associations of romance and dread which the fables of our childhood connect with it rushed coldly and fearfully into my mind the damp dews broke out upon my forehead and the blood curdled in my limbs in that moment i knelt down and vowed a frantic and deadly oaththe words of which i would not now dare to repeatthat before three days expired hell should no longer be cheated of its prey i rosei flung myself on my bed and slept the next day i left my abode i purchased a strong and swift horse and disguising myself from head to foot in a long horsemans cloak i set off alone locking in my heart the calm and cold conviction that my oath should be kept i placed concealed in my dress two pistols my intention was to follow tyrrell wherever he went till we could find ourselves alone and without the chance of intrusion it was then my determination to force him into a contest and that no trembling of the hand no error of the swimming sight might betray my purpose to place us foot to foot and the mouth of each pistol almost to the very temple of each antagonist nor was i deterred for a moment from this resolution by the knowledge that my own death must be as certain as my victims on the contrary i looked forward to dying thus and so baffling the more lingering but not less sure disease which was daily wasting me away with the same fierce yet not unquiet delight with which men have rushed into battle and sought out a death less bitter to them than life for two days though i each day saw tyrrell fate threw into my way no opportunity of executing my design the morning of the third cametyrrell was on the raceground </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> raceground sure that he would remain there for some hours i put up my wearied horse in the town and seating myself in an obscure corner of the course was contented with watching as the serpent does his victim the distant motions of my enemy perhaps you can recollect passing a man seated on the ground and robed in a horsemans cloak i need not tell you that it was i whom you passed and accosted i saw you ride by me but the moment you were gone i forgot the occurrence i looked upon the rolling and distant crowd as a child views the figures of the phantasmagoria scarcely knowing if my eyes deceived me feeling impressed with some stupefying and ghastly sensation of dread and cherishing the conviction that my life was not as the life of the creatures that passed before me the day waned i went back for my horse i returned to the course and keeping at a distance as little suspicious as possible followed the motions of tyrrell he went back to the town rested there repaired to a gamingtable stayed in it a short time returned to his inn and ordered his horse in all these motions i followed the object of my pursuit and my heart bounded with joy when i at last saw him set out alone and in the advancing twilight i followed him till he left the main road now i thought was my time i redoubled my pace and had nearly reached him when some horsemen appearing constrained me again to slacken my pace various other similar interruptions occurred to delay my plot at length all was undisturbed i spurred my horse and was nearly on the heels of my enemy when i perceived him join another man this was you i clenched my teeth and drew my breath as i once more retreated to a distance in a short time two men passed me and i found that owing to some accident on the road they stopped to assist you it appears by your evidence on a subsequent event that these men were thornton and his friend dawson at the time they passed too rapidly and i was too much occupied in my own dark thoughts to observe them still i kept up to you and tyrrell sometimes catching the outlines of your figures through the moon light at others with the acute sense of anxiety only just distinguishing the clang of your horses hoofs on the stony ground at last a heavy shower came on imagine my joy when tyrrell left you and rode off alone i passed you and followed my enemy as fast as my horse would permit but it was not equal to tyrrells which was almost at its full speed however i came at last to a very steep and almost precipitous descent i was forced to ride slowly and cautiously this however i the less regarded from my conviction that tyrrell must be obliged to use the same precaution my hand was on my pistol with a grasp of premeditated revenge when a shrill sharp solitary cry broke on my ear no sound followed all was silence i was just approaching towards the close of the descent when a horse without its rider passed me the shower had ceased and the moon broke from the cloud some minutes before by its light i recognized the horse rode by tyrrell perhaps i thought it has thrown its master and my victim will now be utterly in my power i pushed hastily forward in spite of the hill not yet wholly passed i came to a spot of singular desolation it was a broad patch of waste land a pool of water was on the right and a remarkable and withered tree hung over it i looked round but saw nothing of life stirring a dark and imperfectly developed object lay by the side of the pond i pressed forward merciful god my enemy had escaped my hand and lay in the stillness of death before me what i exclaimed interrupting glanville for i could contain myself no longer it was not by you then that tyrrell fell with these words i grasped his hand and excited as i had been by my painful and wroughtup interest in his recital i burst into tears of gratitude and joy reginald glanville was innocent ellen was not the sister of an assassin after a short pause glanville continued i gazed upon the upward and distorted face in a deep and sickening silence an awe dark and undefined crept over my heart i stood beneath the solemn and sacred heavens and felt that the hand of god was upon me that a mysterious and fearful edict had gone forth that my headlong and unholy wrath had in the very midst of its fury been checked as if but the idle anger of a child that the plan i had laid in the foolish wisdom of my heart had been traced step by step by an allseeing eye and baffled in the moment of its fancied success by an inscrutable and awful doom i had wished the death of my enemy lo my wish was accomplishedhow i neither knew nor guessed there a still and senseless clod of earth without power of offence or injury he lay beneath my feet it seemed as if in the moment of my uplifted arm the divine avenger had asserted his prerogativeas if the angel which had smitten the assyrian had again swept forth though against a meaner victim and while he punished the guilt of a human criminal had set an eternal barrier to the vengeance of a human foe i dismounted from my horse and bent over the murdered man i drew from my bosom the miniature which never forsook me and bathed the lifeless resemblance of gertrude in the blood of her betrayer scarcely had i done so before my ear caught the sound of steps hastily i thrust as i thought the miniature in my bosom remounted and rode hurriedly away at that hour and for many which succeeded to it i believe that all sense was suspended i was like a man haunted by a dream and wandering under its influence or as one whom a spectre pursues and for whose eye the breathing and busy world is but as a land of unreal forms and flitting shadows teeming with the monsters of darkness and the terrors of the tomb it was not till the next day that i missed the picture i returned to the spot searched it carefully but in vain the miniature could not be found i returned to town and shortly afterwards the newspapers informed me of what had subsequently occurred i saw with dismay that all appearances pointed to me as the criminal and that the officers of justice were at that moment tracing the clew which my cloak and the color of my horse afforded them my mysterious pursuit of tyrrell the disguise i had assumed the circumstance of my passing you on the road and of my flight when you approached all spoke volumes against me a stronger evidence yet remained and it was reserved for thornton to indicate it at this moment my life is in his hands shortly after my return to town he forced his way into my room shut the door bolted it and the moment we were alone said with a savage and fiendish grin of exultation and defiance sir reginald glanville you have many a time and oft insulted me with your pride and more with your gifts now it is my time to insult and triumph over you know that one word of mine could sentence you to the gibbet he then minutely summed up the evidence against me and drew from his pocket the threatening letter i had last written to tyrrell you remember that therein i said my vengeance was sworn against him and that sooner or later it should overtake him couple said thornton coldly as he replaced the letter in his pocketcouple these words with the evidence already against you and i would not buy your life at a farthings value how thornton came by this paper so important to my safety i know not but when he read it i was startled by the danger it brought upon me one glance sufficed to show me that i was utterly at the mercy of the villain who stood before me he saw and enjoyed my struggles now said he we know each other at present i want a thousand pounds you will not refuse it me i am sure when it is gone i shall call again till then you can do without me i flung him a check for the money and he departed you may conceive the mortification i endured in this sacrifice of pride to prudence but those were no ordinary motives which induced me to submit to it fast approaching to the grave it mattered to me but little whether a violent death should shorten a life to which a limit was already set and which i was far from being anxious to retain but i could not endure the thought of bringing upon my mother and my sister the wretchedness and shame which the mere suspicion of a crime so enormous would occasion them and when my eye caught all the circumstances arrayed against me my pride seemed to suffer a less mortification even in the course i adopted than in the thought of the felons gaol and the criminals trialthe hoots and execrations of the mob and the death and ignominious remembrance of the murderer stronger than either of these motives was my shrinking and loathing aversion to whatever seemed likely to unrip the secret history of the past i sickened at the thought of gertrudes name and fate being bared to the vulgar eye and exposed to the comment the strictures the ridicule of the gaping and curious public it seemed to me therefore but a very poor exertion of philosophy to conquer my feelings of humiliation at thorntons insolence and triumph and to console myself with the reflection that a few months must rid me </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> me alike of his exactions and my life but of late thorntons persecutions and demands have risen to such a height that i have been scarcely able to restrain my indignation and control myself into compliance the struggle is too powerful for my frame it is rapidly bringing on the fiercest and the last contest i shall suffer before the wicked shall cease from troubling and the weary be at rest some days since i came to a resolution which i am now about to execute it is to leave this country and take refuge on the continent there i shall screen myself from thorntons pursuit and the danger which it entails upon me and there unknown and undisturbed i shall await the termination of my disease but two duties remained to me to fulfil before i departed i have now discharged them both one was due to the warmhearted and noble being who honoured me with her interest and affectionthe other to you i went yesterday to the former i sketched the outline of that history which i have detailed to you i showed her the waste of my barren heart and spoke to her of the disease which was wearing me away how beautiful is the love of woman she would have followed me over the worldreceived my last sigh and seen me to the rest i shall find at length and this without a hope or thought of recompense even from the worthlessness of my love but enoughof her my farewell has been taken your suspicions i have seen and forgiven for they were natural it was due to me to remove them the pressure of your hand tells me that i have done so but i had another reason for my confessions i have worn away the romance of my heart and i have now no indulgence for the little delicacies and petty scruples which often stand in the way of our real happiness i have marked your former addresses to ellen and i confess with great joy for i know amidst all your worldly ambition and the encrusted artificiality of your exterior how warm and generous is your real hearthow noble and intellectual is your real mind and were my sister tenfold more perfect than i believe her i do not desire to find on earth one more deserving of her than yourself i have remarked your late estrangement from ellen and while i guessed i felt that however painful to me i ought to remove the cause she loves youthough perhaps you know it notmuch and truly and since my earlier life has been passed in a selfish inactivity i would fain let it close with the reflection of having served two beings whom i prize so dearly and the hope that their happiness will commence with my death and now pelham i have done i am weak and exhausted and cannot bear moreeven of your society now think over what i have last said and let me see you again tomorrow on the day after i leave england forever </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxvi but wilt thou accept not the worship the heart lifts above and the heavens reject not the desire of the moth for the star of the night for the morrow the devotion to something afar from the sphere of our sorrowp b shelley it was not with a light heartfor i loved glanville too well not to be powerfully affected by his history and approaching fatebut with a chastised and sober joy that i now beheld my friend innocent of the guilt my suspicions had accused him of and the only obstacle to my marriage with his sister removed true it was that the sword yet hung over his head and that while he lived there could be no rational assurance of his safety from the disgrace and death of the felon in the worlds eye therefore the barrier to my union with ellen would have been far from being wholly removed but at that moment my disappointments had disgusted me with the world and i turned with a double yearning of heart to her whose pure and holy love could be at once my recompence and retreat nor was this selfish consideration my only motive in the conduct i was resolved to adopt on the contrary it was scarcely more prominent in my mind than those derived from giving to a friend who was now dearer to me than ever his only consolation on this earth and to ellen the safest protection in case of any danger to her brother with these it is true were mingled feelings which in happier circumstances might have been those of transport at a bright and successful termination to a deep and devoted love but these i had while glanvilles very life was so doubtful little right to indulge and i checked them as soon as they arose after a sleepless night i repaired to lady glanvilles house it was long since i had been there and the servant who admitted me seemed somewhat surprised at the earliness of my visit i desired to see the mother and waited in the parlour till she came i made but a scanty exordium to my speech in very few words i expressed my love to ellen and besought her mediation in my behalf nor did i think it would be a slight consideration in my favour with the fond mother to mention glanvilles concurrence with my suit ellen is up stairs in the drawingroom said lady glanville i will go and prepare her to receive youif you have her consent you have mine will you suffer me then said i to forestal you forgive my impatience and let me see her before you do lady glanville was a woman of the good old school and stood somewhat upon forms and ceremonies i did not therefore await the answer which i foresaw might not be favourable to my success but with my customary assurance left the room and hastened up stairs i entered the drawingroom and shut the door ellen was at the far end and as i entered with a light step she did not perceive me till i was close by she started when she saw me and her cheek before very pale deepened into crimson good heavens is it you she said falteringly ii thoughtbutbutexcuse me for an instant i will call my mother stay for one instant i beseech youit is from your mother that i comeshe has referred me to you and with a trembling and hurried voice for all my usual boldness forsook me i poured forth in rapid and burning words the history of my secret and hoarded loveits doubts fears and hopes ellen sunk back on her chair overpowered and silent by her feelings and the vehemence of my own i knelt and took her hand i covered it with my kissesit was not withdrawn from them i raised my eyes and beheld in hers all that my heart had hoped but did not dare to pourtray youyou said shewhen at last she found wordsi imagined that you only thought of ambition and the worldi could not have dreamt of this she ceased blushing and embarrassed it is true said i that you had a right to think so for till this moment i have never opened to you even a glimpse of my veiled heart and its secret and wild desires but do you think that my love was the less a treasure because it was hidden or the less deep because it was cherished at the bottom of my soul nono believe me that love was not to be mingled with the ordinary objects of lifeit was too pure to be profaned by the levities and follies which are all of my nature that i have permitted myself to develope to the world do not imagine that because i have seemed an idler with the idleselfish with the interestedand cold and vain and frivolous with those to whom such qualities were both a passport and a virtue do not imagine that i have concealed within me nothing more worthy of you and of myself my very love for you shews that i am wiser and better than i have seemed speak to me ellenmay i call you by that nameone wordone syllable speak to me and tell me that you have read my heart and that you will not reject it there came no answer from those dear lips but their soft and tender smile told me that i might hope that hour i still recall and bless that hour was the happiest of my life </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxvii a thousand crowns or else lay down your head2nd part of henry vi from ellen i hastened to the house of sir reginald the hall was in all the confusion of approaching departure i sprang over the paraphernalia of books and boxes which obstructed my way and bounded up the stairs glanville was as usual alone his countenance was less pale than it had been lately and when i saw it brighten as i approached i hoped in the new happiness of my heart that he might baffle both his enemy and his disease i told him all that had just occurred between ellen and myself and now said i as i clasped his hand i have a proposal to make to which you must accede let me accompany you abroad i will go with you to whatever corner of the world you may select we will plan together every possible method of concealing our retreat upon the past i will never speak to you in your hours of solitude i will never disturb you by an unwelcome and illtimed sympathy i will tend upon you watch over you bear with you with more than the love and tenderness of a brother you shall see me only when you wish it your loneliness shall never be invaded when you get better as i presage you will i will leave you to come back to england and provide for the worst by ensuring your sister a protector i will then return to you alone that your seclusion may not be endangered by the knowledge even of </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> of ellen and you shall have me by your side tilltill the last interrupted glanville tootoo generous pelham i feelthese tears the first i have shed for a long long time tell you that i feel to the heartyour friendship and disinterested attachment but the moment your love for ellen has become successful i will not tear you from its enjoyment believe me all that i could derive from your society could not afford me half the happiness i should have in knowing that you and ellen were blest in each other nono my solitude will at that reflection be deprived of its sting you shall hear from me once again my letter shall contain a request and your executing that last favour must console and satisfy the kindness of your heart for myself i shall die as i have livedalone all fellowship with my griefs would seem to me strange and unwelcome i would not suffer glanville to proceed i interrupted him with fresh arguments and entreaties to which he seemed at last to submit and i was in the firm hope of having conquered his determination when we were startled by a sudden and violent noise in the hall it is thornton said glanville calmly i told them not to admit him and he is forcing his way scarcely had sir reginald said this before thornton burst abruptly into the room although it was scarcely noon he was more than half intoxicated and his eyes swam in his head with a maudlin expression of triumph and insolence as he rolled towards us oh oh sir reginald he said thought of giving me the slip eh your dd servants said you were out but i soon silenced them egad i made them as nimble as cows in a cagei have not learnt the use of my fists for nothing so youre going abroad tomorrow without my leave toopretty good joke that indeed come come my brave fellow you need not scowl at me in that way why you look as surly as a butchers dog with a broken head glanville who was lived with illsuppressed rage rose haughtily mr thornton he said in a calm voice although he was trembling in his extreme passion from head to foot i am not now prepared to submit to your insolence and intrusion you will leave this room instantly if you have any further demands upon me i will hear them tonight at any hour you please to appoint no no my fine fellow said thornton with a coarse chuckle you have as much wit as three folks two fools and a madman but you wont do me for all that the instant my back is turned yours will be turned too and by the time i call again your honour will be half way to calais butbless my stars mr pelham is that you i really did not see you before i suppose you are not in the secret i have no secrets from mr pelham said glanville nor do i care if you discuss the whole of your nefarious transactions with me in his presence since you doubt my word it is beneath my dignity to vindicate it and your business can as well be dispatched now as hereafter you have heard rightly that i intend leaving england tomorrow and now sir what is your will by gd sir reginald glanville exclaimed thornton who seemed stung to the quick by glanvilles contemptuous coldness you shall not leave england without my leave ay you may frown but i say you shall not nay you shall not budge a foot from this very room unless i cry be it so glanville could no longer restrain himself he would have sprung towards thornton but i seized and arrested him i read in the malignant and incensed countenance of his persecutor all the danger to which a single imprudence would have exposed him and i trembled for his safety i whispered as i forced him again to his seat leave me alone to settle with this man and i will endeavour to free you from him i did not tarry for his answer but turning to thornton said to him coolly but civilly sir reginald glanville has acquainted me with the nature of your very extraordinary demands upon him did he adopt my advice he would immediately place the affair in the hands of his legal advisers his ill health however his anxiety to leave england and his wish to sacrifice almost every thing to quiet induce him rather than take this alternative to silence your importunities by acceding to claims however illegal and unjust if therefore you now favour sir reginald with your visit for the purpose of making a demand previous to his quitting england and which consequently will be the last to which he will concede you will have the goodness to name the amount of your claim and should it be reasonable i think sir reginald will authorize me to say that it shall be granted well now cried thornton thats what i call talking like a sensible man and though i am not fond of speaking to a third person when the principal is present yet as you have always been very civil to me i have no objection to treating with you please to give sir reginald this paper if he will but take the trouble to sign it he may go to the falls of niagara for me i wont interrupt himso he had better put pen to paper and get rid of me at once for i know i am as welcome as snow in harvest i took the paper which was folded up and gave it to glanville who leant back on his chair halfexhausted by his rage he glanced his eye over it and then tore it into a thousand pieces and trampled it beneath his feet go exclaimed he go rascal and do your worst i will not make myself a beggar to enrich you my whole fortune would but answer this demand do as you please sir reginald answered thornton grinning do as you please its not a long walk from hence to bowstreet nor a long swing from newgate to the gallows do as you please sir reginald do as you please and the villain flung himself at full length on the costly ottoman and eyed glanvilles countenance with an easy and malicious effrontery which seemed to say i know you will struggle but you cannot help yourself i took glanville aside my dear friend said i believe me that i share your indignation to the utmost but we must do any thing rather than incense this wretch what is his demand i speak literally replied glanville when i say that it covers nearly the whole of my fortune for my habits of extravagance have very much curtailed my means it is the exact sum i had set apart for a marriage gift to my sister in addition to her own fortune then said i you shall give it him your sister has no longer any necessity for a portion her marriage with me prevents thatand with regard to yourself your wants are not manysuch as it is you can share my fortune nonono cried glanville and his generous nature lashing him into fresh rage he broke from my grasp and moved menacingly to thornton that person still lay on the ottoman regarding us with an air half contemptuous half exulting leave the room instantly said glanville or you will repent it what another murder sir reginald said thornton no i am not a sparrow to have my neck wrenched by a womans hand like yours give me my demandsign the paper and i will leave you for ever and a day i will commit no such folly answered glanville if you will accept five thousand pounds you shall have that sum but were the rope on my neck you should not wring from me a farthing more five thousand repeated thornton a mere dropa childs toywhy you are playing with me sir reginaldnay i am a reasonable man and will abate a trifle or so of my just claims but you must not take advantage of my good nature make me snug and easy for lifelet me keep a brace of huntersa cosey boxa bit of land to it and a girl after my own heart and ill say quits with you now mr pelham who is a longheaded gentleman and does not spit on his own blanket knows well enough that one cant do all this for five thousand pounds make it a thousand a yearthat is give me a cool twenty thousandand i wont exact another sous egad this drinking makes one deuced thirstymr pelham just reach me that glass of wateri hear bees in my head seeing that i did not stir thornton rose with an oath against pride and swaggering towards the table took up a tumbler of water which happened accidentally to be there close by it was the picture of the illfated gertrude the gambler who was evidently so intoxicated as to be scarcely conscious of his motions or words otherwise in all probability he would to borrow from himself a proverb illustrative of his profession have played his cards better took up the portrait glanville saw the action and was by his side in an instant touch it not with your accursed hands he cried in an ungovernable fury leave your hold this instant or i will dash you to pieces thornton kept a firm gripe of the picture heres a todo said he tauntingly was there ever such work about a poorusing a word too coarse for repetition before the word had scarcely passed his lips when he was stretched at his full length upon the ground nor did glanville stop there with all the strength of his nervous and herculean frame fully requited for the debility of disease by the fury of the moment he seized the gamester as if he had been an infant and dragged him to the door the next moment i heard his heavy frame rolling down the stairs with no decorous slowness of descent glanville reappeared good god i cried what </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> what have you done but he was too lost in his still unappeased rage to heed me he leaned panting and breathless against the wall with clenched teeth and a flashing eye rendered more terribly bright by the feverish lustre natural to his disease presently i heard thornton reascend the stairs he opened the door and entered but one pace never did human face wear a more fiendish expression of malevolence and wrath sir reginald glanville he said i thank you heartily he must have iron nails who scratches a bear you have sent me a challenge and the hangman shall bring you my answer good day sir reginaldgood day mr pelham and so saying he shut the door and rapidly descending the stairs was out of the house in an instant there is no time to be lost said i order post horses to your carriage and be gone instantly you are wrong replied glanville slowly recovering himself i must not fly it would be worse than useless it would seem the strongest argument against me remember that if thornton has really gone to inform against me the officers of justice would arrest me long before i reached calais or even if i did elude their pursuit so far i should be as much in their power in france as in england but to tell you the truth i do not think thornton will inform money to a temper like his is a stronger temptation than revenge and before he has been three minutes in the air he will perceive the folly of losing the golden harvest he may yet make of me for the sake of a momentary passion nomy best plan will be to wait here till tomorrow as i originally intended in the meanwhile he will in all probability pay me another visit and i will make a compromise with his demands despite of my fears i could not but see the justice of these observations the more especially as a still stronger argument than any urged by glanville forced itself on my mind this was my internal conviction that thornton himself was guilty of the murder of tyrrell and that therefore he would for his own sake avoid the new and particularizing scrutiny into that dreadful event which his accusation of glanville would necessarily occasion both of us were wrong villains have passions as well as honest men and they will therefore forfeit their own interest in obedience to those passions while the calculations of prudence invariably suppose that that interest is their only rule note i mean interest in the general not the utilitarian signification of the word glanville was so enfeebled by his late excitation that he besought me once more to leave him to himself i did so under a promise that he would admit me again in the evening for notwithstanding my persuasion that thornton would not put his threats into execution i could not conquer a latent foreboding of dread and evil

<chapter>chapter lxxviii away with him to prisonwhere is the provostmeasure for measure i returned home perplexed by a thousand contradictory thoughts upon the scene i had just witnessed the more i reflected the more i regretted the fatality of the circumstances that had tempted glanville to accede to thorntons demand true it was that thorntons selfregard might be deemed a sufficient guarantee for his concealment of such extortionate transactions moreover it was difficult to say when the formidable array of appearances against glanville was considered whether any other line of conduct than that which he had adopted could with any safety have been pursued his feelings too with regard to the unfortunate gertrude i could fully enter into and sympathize with but in spite of all these considerations it was with an inexpressible aversion that i contemplated the idea of that tacit confession of guilt which his compliance with thorntons exactions so unhappily implied it was therefore a thought of some satisfaction that my rash and hasty advice of a still further concession to those extortions had not been acceded to my present intention was in the event of glanvilles persevering to reject my offer of accompanying him to remain in england for the purpose of sifting the murder nor did i despair of accomplishing this most desirable end through the means of dawson for there was but little doubt in my own mind that thornton and himself were the murderers and i hoped that address or intimidation might win a confession from dawson although it might probably be unavailing with his hardened and crafty associate occupied with these thoughts i endeavoured to while away the hours till the evening summoned me once more to the principal object of my reflections directly glanvilles door was opened i saw by one glance that i had come too late the whole house was in confusion several of the servants were in the hall conferring with each other with that mingled mystery and agitation which always accompany the fears and conjectures of the lower classes i took aside the valet who had lived with glanville for some years and who was remarkably attached to his master and learnt that somewhat more than an hour before mr thornton had returned to the house accompanied by three men of very suspicious appearance in short sir said the man lowering his voice to a whisper i knew one of them by sight he was mr s the bowstreet officer with these men sir reginald left the house merely saying in his usual quiet manner that he did not know when he should return i concealed my perturbation and endeavoured as far as i was able to quiet the evident apprehensions of the servant at all events seymour said i i know that i may trust you sufficiently to warn you against mentioning the circumstance any farther above all let me beg of you to stop the mouths of those idle loiterers in the halland be sure that you do not give any unnecessary alarm to lady and miss glanville the poor man promised with tears in his eyes that he would obey my injunctions and with a calm face but a sickening heart i turned away from the house i knew not where to direct my wanderings fortunately i recollected that i should in all probability be among the first witnesses summoned on glanvilles examination and that perhaps by the time i reached home i might already receive an intimation to that effect accordingly i retraced my steps and on reentering my hotel was told by the waiter with a mysterious air that a gentleman was waiting to see me seated by the window in my room and wiping his forehead with a red silk pockethandkerchief was a short thickset man with a fiery and rugose complexion not altogether unlike the aspect of a mulberry from underneath a pair of shaggy brows peeped two singularly small eyes which made ample amends by their fire for their deficiency in sizethey were black brisk and somewhat fierce in their expression a nose of that shape vulgarly termed bottle formed the arch sublime the bridge the twilight as it were between the purple sunset of one cheek and the glowing sunrise of the other his mouth was small and drawn up on each corner like a pursethere was something sour and crabbed about it if it was like a purse it was the purse of a miser a fair round chin had not been condemned to single blessednesson the contrary it was like a farmers pillion and carried double on either side of a very low forehead hedged round by closely mowed bristles of a dingy black were two enormous ears of the same intensely rubicund colour as that inflamed pendant of flesh which adorns the throat of an enraged turkeycock ears so large and so red i never beheld beforethey were something preposterous this enchanting figure which was attired in a sober suit of leaden black relieved by a long gold watchchain and a plentiful decoration of seals rose at my entrance with a solemn grunt and a still more solemn bow i shut the door carefully and asked him his businessas i had foreseen it was a request from the magistrate at to attend a private examination on the ensuing day sad thing sir sad thing said mr it would be quite shocking to hang a gentleman of sir reginald glanvilles qualityso distinguished an orator too sad thing sirvery sad thing oh said i quietly there is not a doubt as to sir reginalds innocence of the crime laid to him and probably mr i may call in your assistance tomorrow to ascertain the real murderersi think i am possessed of some clue mrpricked up his earsthose enormous ears sir he said i shall be happy to accompany youvery happy give me the clue you speak of and i will soon find the villains horrid thing sir murdervery horrid its too hard that a gentleman cannot take his ride home from a race or a merrymaking but he must have his throat cut from ear to earear to ear sir and with these words the speakers own auricular protuberances seemed to glow as if in conscious horror with a double carnation very true mr said i say i will certainly attend the examinationtill then good bye at this hint my fiery faced friend made me a low bow and blazed out of the room like the ghost of a kitchen fire left to myself i revolved earnestly and anxiously every thing that could tend to diminish the appearances against glanville and direct suspicion to that quarter where i was confident the guilt rested in this endeavour i passed the time till morning when i fell into an uneasy slumber which lasted some hours when i awoke it was almost time to attend the magistrates appointment i dressed hastily and soon found myself in the room of inquisition it is impossible to conceive a more courteous and yet more equitable man than the magistrate whom i had the honour of attending he spoke with great feeling on the subject for which i was summonedowned to me that thorntons statement was very clear and forcibletrusted that my evidence would contradict an account </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> account which he was very loth to believe and then proceeded to the question i saw with an agony which i can scarcely express that all my answers made powerfully against the cause i endeavoured to support i was obliged to own that a man on horseback passed me soon after tyrrell had quitted me that on coming to the spot where the deceased was found i saw this same horseman on the very place that i believed nay that i was sure how could i evade this that that man was sir reginald glanville farther evidence thornton had already offered to adduce he could prove that the said horseman had been mounted on a grey horse sold to a person answering exactly to the description of sir reginald glanville moreover that that horse was yet in the stables of the prisoner he produced a letter which he said he had found upon the person of the deceased signed by sir reginald glanville and containing the most deadly threats against his life and to crown all he called upon me to witness that we had both discovered upon the spot where the murder was committed a picture belonging to the prisoner since restored to him and now in his possession at the close of this examination the worthy magistrate shook his head in evident distress i have known sir reginald glanville personally said he in private as in public life i have always thought him the most upright and honourable of men i feel the greatest pain in saying that it will be my duty fully to commit him for trial i interrupted the magistrate i demanded that dawson should be produced i have already said he inquired of thornton respecting that person whose testimony is of evident importance he tells me that dawson has left the country and can give me no clue to his address he lies cried i in the abrupt anguish of my heart his associate shall be produced hear me i have been next to thornton the chief witness against the prisoner and when i swear to you that in spite of all appearances i most solemnly believe in his innocence you may rely on my assurance that there are circumstances in his favour which have not yet been considered but which i will pledge myself hereafter to adduce i then related to the private ear of the magistrate my firm conviction of the guilt of the accuser himself i dwelt forcibly upon the circumstance of tyrrells having mentioned to me that thornton was aware of the large sum he had on his person and of the strange disappearance of that sum when his body was examined in the fatal field after noting how impossible it was that glanville could have stolen this money i insisted strongly on the distressed circumstancesthe dissolute habits and the hardened character of thorntoni recalled to the mind of the magistrate the singularity of thorntons absence from home when i called there and the doubtful nature of his excuse much more i said but all equally in vain the only point where i was successful was in pressing for a delay which was granted to the passionate manner in which i expressed my persuasion that i could confirm my suspicions by much stronger data before the reprieve expired it is very true said the righteous magistrate that there are appearances somewhat against the witness but certainly not tantamount to any thing above a slight suspicion if however you positively think you can ascertain any facts to elucidate this mysterious crime and point the inquiries of justice to another quarter i will so far strain the question as to remand the prisoner to another daylet us say the day after tomorrow if nothing important can before then be found in his favour he must be committed for trial </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxix nihil est furacius illo non fuit autolyci tam piccata manusmartial quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodohorace when i left the magistrate i knew not whither my next step should tend there was however no time to indulge the idle stupor which glanvilles situation at first occasioned with a violent effort i shook it off and bent all my mind to discover the best method to avail myself to the utmost of the short reprieve i had succeeded in obtaining at length one of those sudden thoughts which from their suddenness appear more brilliant than they really are flashed upon my mind i remembered the accomplished character of mr job jonson and the circumstance of my having seen him in company with thornton now although it was not very likely that thornton should have made mr jonson his confidant in any of those affairs which it was so essentially his advantage to confine exclusively to himself yet the acuteness and penetration visible in the character of the worthy job might not have lain so fallow during his companionship with thornton but that it might have made some discoveries which would considerably assist me in my researches besides as it is literally true in the systematized roguery of london that birds of a feather flock together it was by no means unlikely that the honest job might be honoured with the friendship of mr dawson as well as the company of mr thornton in which case i looked forward with greater confidence to the detection of the notable pair i could not however conceal from myself that this was but a very unstable and illlinked chain of reasoning and there were moments when the appearances against glanville wore so close a semblance of truth that all my friendship could scarcely drive from my mind an intrusive suspicion that he might have deceived me and that the accusation might not be groundless this unwelcome idea did not however at all lessen the rapidity with which i hastened towards the memorable gin shop where i had whilom met mr gordonthere i hoped to find either the address of that gentleman or of the club to which he had taken me in company with tringle and dartmore either at this said club or of that said gentleman i thought it not unlikely that i might hear some tidings of the person of mr job jonsonif not i was resolved to return to the office and employ mrmy mulberrycheeked acquaintance of the last night in a search after the holy job fate saved me a world of trouble as i was hastily walking onwards i happened to turn my eyes on the opposite side of the way and discovered a man dressed in what the newspapers term the very height of the fashion namely in the most ostentatious attire that ever flaunted at margate or blazoned in the palais royale the nether garments of this petit maitre consisted of a pair of blue tight pantaloons profusely braided and terminating in hessian boots adorned with brass spurs of the most burnished resplendency a black velvet waistcoat studded with gold stars was backed by a green frock coat covered notwithstanding the heat of the weather with fur and frogged and cordonne with the most lordly indifference both as to taste and expense a small french hat which might not have been much too large for my lord of p was set jauntily in the centre of a system of long black curls which my eye long accustomed to penetrate the arcana of habilatory art discovered at once to be a wig a fierce black mustacheo very much curled wandered lovingly from the upper lip towards the eyes which had an unfortunate prepossession for eccentricity in their direction to complete the picture we must suppose some colouringand this consisted in a very nice and delicate touch of the rouge pot which could not be called by so harsh a term as paint say rather that it was a tinge no sooner had i set my eyes upon this figure than i crossed over to the side of the way which it was adorning and followed its motions at a respectful but observant distance at length my freluquet marched into a jewellers shop in oxfordstreet with a careless air i affected two minutes afterwards to saunter into the same shop the shopman was shewing his bijouterie to him of the hessians with the greatest respect and beguiled by the splendour of the wig and waistcoat turned me over to his apprenticeanother time i might have been indignant at perceiving that the air noble on which i piqued myself far more than all other gifts of nature personal or mental was by no means so universally acknowledged as i had vainly imaginedat that moment i was too occupied to think of my insulted dignity while i was pretending to appear wholly engrossed with some seals i kept a vigilant eye on my superb fellow customer at last i saw him secrete a diamond ring and thrust it by a singular movement of the fore finger up the fur cuff of his capacious sleeve presently some other article of minute size disappeared in the like manner the gentleman then rose expressed himself very well satisfied by the great taste of the jeweller said he should look in again on saturday when he hoped the set he had ordered would be completed and gravely took his departure amidst the prodigal bows of the shopman and his helpmates meanwhile i bought a seal of small value paid for it and followed my old acquaintance for the reader has doubtless discovered long before this that the gentleman was no other than mr job jonson slowly and struttingly did the man of two virtues perform the whole pilgrimage of oxfordstreet he stopped at cumberlandgate and looking round with an air of gentlemanlike indecision seemed to consider whether or not he should join the loungers in the park fortunately for that well bred set his doubts terminated in their favour and mr job jonson entered the park every one happened to be thronging to kensington gardens and the man of two virtues accordingly cut across the park as the shortest but the least frequented way thither in order to confer upon them the dangerous honour of his company directly i perceived that there were but few persons in the immediate locality to observe </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> observe me and that those consisted of a tall guardsman and his wife a family of young children with their nurserymaid and a debilitated east india captain walking for the sake of his liver i overtook the incomparable job made him a low bow and thus reverently accosted him mr jonson i am delighted once more to meet yousuffer me to remind you of the very pleasant morning i passed with you in the neighbourhood of hampton court i perceive by your mustachios and military dress that you have entered the army since that day i congratulate the british troops on such an admirable acquisition mr jonsons assurance forsook him for a moment but he lost no time in regaining a quality which was so natural to his character he assumed a fierce look and relevant sa moustache sourit amerement like voltaires governor note don fernand dibarra in the candidedn your eyes sir he cried do you mean to insult me i know none of your mr jonsons and i never set my eyes upon you before lookye my dear mr job jonson replied i as i can prove not only all i say but much more that i shall not saysuch as your little mistakes just now at the jewellers shop in oxfordstreet perhaps it would be better for you not to oblige me to create a mob and give you in chargepardon my abruptness of speechto a constablesurely there will be no need of such a disagreeable occurrence when i assure you in the first place that i perfectly forgive you for ridding me of the unnecessary comforts of a pocketbook and handkerchief the unphilosophical appendage of a purse and the effeminate gage damour of a gold bracelet nor is this allit is perfectly indifferent to me whether you levy contributions on jewellers or gentlemen and i am very far from wishing to intrude upon your harmless occupations or to interfere with your innocent amusements i see mr jonson that you are beginning to understand me let me facilitate so desirable an end by an additional information that since it is preceded with a promise to open my purse may tend somewhat to open your heart i am at this moment in great want of your assistancefavour me with it and i will pay you to your souls content are we friends now mr job jonson my old friend burst out into a loud laugh well sir i must say that your frankness enchants me i can no longer dissemble with you indeed i perceive it would be useless besides i always adored candourit is my favourite virtue tell me how i can help you and you may command my services one word said i will you be open and ingenuous with me i shall ask you certain questions not in the least affecting your own safety but to which if you would serve me you must give me and since candour is your favourite virtue this will be no difficult task your most candid replies to strengthen you in so righteous a course know also that the said replies will come verbatim before a court of law and that therefore it will be a matter of prudence to shape them as closely to the truth as your inclinations will allow to counterbalance this information which i own is not very inviting i repeat that the questions asked you will be wholly foreign to your own affairs and that should you prove of that assistance to me which i anticipate i will so testify my gratitude as to place you beyond the necessity of pillaging rural young gentlemen and credulous shopkeepers for the futureall your present pursuits need only be carried on for your private amusement i repeat that you may command me returned mr jonson gracefully putting his hand to his heart pray then said i to come at once to the point how long have you been acquainted with mr thomas thornton for some months only returned job without the least embarrassment and mr dawson said i a slight change came over jonsons countenance he hesitated excuse me sir said he but i am really perfectly unacquainted with you and i may be falling into some trap of the law of which heaven knows i am as ignorant as a babe unborn i saw the knavish justice of this remark and in my predominating zeal to serve glanville i looked upon the inconvenience of discovering myself to a pickpocket and sharper as a consideration not worth attending to in order therefore to remove his doubts and at the same time to have a more secret and undisturbed place for our conference i proposed to him to accompany me home at first mr jonson demurred but i soon half persuaded and half intimidated him into compliance not particularly liking to be publicly seen with a person of his splendid description and celebrated character i made him walk before me to mivarts and i followed him closely never turning my eye either to the right or the left lest he should endeavour to escape me there was no fear of this for mr jonson was both a bold and a crafty man and it required perhaps but little of his penetration to discover that i was no officer nor informer and that my communication had been of a nature likely enough to terminate in his advantage there was therefore but little need of his courage in accompanying me to my hotel there were a good many foreigners of rank at mivarts and the waiters took my companion for an ambassador at leasthe received their homage with the mingled dignity and condescension natural to so great a man as the day was now far advanced i deemed it but hospitable to offer mr job jonson some edible refreshment with the frankness on which he so justly valued himself he accepted my proposal i ordered some cold meat and two bottles of wine and mindful of old maxims deferred my business till his repast was over i conversed with him merely upon ordinary topics and at another time should have been much amused by the singular mixture of impudence and shrewdness which formed the stratum of his character at length his appetite was satisfied and one of the bottles emptied with the other before him his body easily reclining on my library chair his eyes apparently cast downwards but ever and anon glancing up at my countenance with a searching and curious look mr job jonson prepared himself for our conference accordingly i began you say that you are acquainted with mr dawson where is he at present i dont know answered jonson laconically come said i no triflingif you do not know you can learn possibly i can in the course of time rejoined honest job if you cannot tell me his residence at once said i our conference is at an end that is a leading feature in my inquiries jonson paused before he repliedyou have spoken to me frankly let us do nothing by halvestell me at once the nature of the service i can do you and the amount of my reward and then you shall have my answer with respect to dawson i will confess to you that i did once know him well and that we have done many a mad prank together which i should not like the bugaboos and bulkies to know you will therefore see that i am naturally reluctant to tell you any thing about him unless your honour will inform me of the why and the wherefore i was somewhat startled by this speech and by the shrewd cunning eye which dwelt upon me as it was uttered but however i was by no means sure that acceding to his proposal would not be my readiest and wisest way to the object i had in view nevertheless there were some preliminary questions to be got over first perhaps dawson might be too dear a friend to the candid job for the latter to endanger his safety or perhaps and this was more probable jonson might be perfectly ignorant of any thing likely to aid me in this case my communication would be useless accordingly i said after a short consideration patience my dear mr jonsonpatience you shall know all in good time meanwhile i musteven for dawsons sakequestion you blindfold what now if your poor friend dawson were in imminent danger and that you might have the power to save him would you not do all you could the small coarse features of mr job grew blank with a curious sort of disappointment is that all said he no unless i were well paid for my pains in his behalf he might go to botany bay for all i care what i cried in a tone of reproach is this your friendship i thought just now that you said dawson had been an old and firm associate of yours an old one your honour but not a firm one a short time ago i was in great distress and he and thornton had god knows how about two thousand pounds between them but i could not worm a stiver out of dawsonthat gripeall thornton got it all from him two thousand pounds said i in a calm voice though my heart beat violently thats a great sum for a poor fellow like dawson how long ago is it since he had it about two or three months answered jonson pray have you seen much of dawson lately i asked i have replied jonson indeed said i i thought you told me just now that you were unacquainted with his residence so i am replied jonson coldly it is not at his own house that i ever see him i was silent for i was now rapidly and minutely weighing the benefits and disadvantages of trusting jonson as he had desired me to do to reduce the question to the simplest form of logic he had either the power of assisting my investigation or he had not if not neither could he much impede it and therefore it mattered little whether he was in my confidence or not if he had the power the doubt </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> doubt was whether it would be better for me to benefit by it openly or by stratagem that iswhether it were wiser to state the whole case to him or continue to gain whatever i was able by dint of a blind examination now the disadvantage of candour was that if it were his wish to screen dawson and his friend he would be prepared to do so and even to put them on their guard against my suspicions but the indifference he had testified with regard to dawson seemed to render this probability very small the benefits of candour were more prominent job would then be fully aware that his own safety was not at stake and should i make it more his interest to serve the innocent than the guilty i should have the entire advantage not only of any actual information he might possess but of his skill and shrewdness in providing additional proof or at least suggesting advantageous hints moreover in spite of my vanity and opinion of my own penetration i could not but confess that it was unlikely that my crossexamination should be very successful with so old and experienced a sinner as mr jonson set a thief to catch a thief is among the wisest of wise sayings and accordingly i resolved in favour of a disclosure drawing my chair close to jonsons fixing my eye upon his countenance and throwing into my own the most open yet earnest expression i could summon i briefly proceeded to sketch glanvilles situation only concealing his name and thorntons charges i mentioned my own suspicions of the accuser and my desire of discovering dawson whom thornton appeared to me artfully to secrete lastly i concluded with a solemn promise that if my listener could by any zeal exertion knowledge or contrivance of his own procure the detection of the men whom i was convinced were the murderers a pension of three hundred pounds ayear should be immediately settled upon him during my communication the patient job sat mute and still fixing his eyes on the ground and only betraying by an occasional elevation of the brows that he took the slightest interest in the tale when however i touched upon the peroration which so tenderly concluded with the mention of three hundred pounds ayear a visible change came over the countenance of mr jonson he rubbed his hands with an air of great content and one sudden smile broke over his features and almost buried his eyes amid the intricate host of wrinkles it called forth the smile vanished as rapidly as it came and mr job turned round to me with a solemn and sedate aspect well your honour said he im glad youve told me all we must see what can be done as for thornton im afraid we shant make much out of him for hes an old offender whose conscience is as hard as a brickbat but of dawson i hope better things however you must let me go now for this is a matter that requires a vast deal of private consideration i shall call upon you tomorrow sir before ten oclock since you say matters are so pressing and i trust you will then see that you have no reason to repent of the confidence you have placed in a man of honour so saying mr job jonson emptied the remainder of the bottle into his tumbler held it up to the light with the gusto of a connoisseur and concluded his potations with a hearty smack of the lips followed by a long sigh ah your honour said he good wine is a marvellous whetter of the intellect but your true philosopher is always moderate for my part i never exceed my two bottles and with these words this true philosopher took his departure no sooner was i freed from his presence than my thoughts flew to ellen i had neither been able to call nor write the whole of the day and i was painfully fearful lest my precautions with sir reginalds valet had been frustrated and the alarm of his imprisonment reached her and lady glanville harassed by this fear i disregarded the lateness of the hour and immediately repaired to berkeleysquare lady and miss glanville were alone and at dinner the servant spoke with his usual unconcernthey are quite well said i relieved but still anxious and the servant replying in the affirmative i again returned home and wrote a long and i hope consoling letter to sir reginald </chapter> </volume>

<chapter>chapter lxxx k henry lord say jack cade hath sworn to have thy head say ay but i hope your highness shall have his2nd part of henry iv punctual to his appointment the next morning came mr job jonson i had been on the rack of expectation for the last three hours previous to his arrival and the warmth of my welcome must have removed any little diffidence with which so shamefaced a gentleman might possibly have been troubled at my request he sat himself down and seeing that my breakfast things were on the table remarked what a famous appetite the fresh air always gave him i took the hint and pushed the rolls towards him he immediately fell to work and for the next quarter of an hour his mouth was far too well occupied for the intrusive impertinence of words at last the things were removed and mr jonson began i have thought well over the matter your honour and i believe we can manage to trounce the rascalsfor i agree with you that there is not a doubt that thornton and dawson are the real criminals but the affair sir is one of the greatest difficulty and importancenay of the greatest personal danger my life may be the forfeit of my desire to serve youyou will not therefore be surprised at my accepting your liberal offer of three hundred a year should i be successful although i do assure you sir that it was my original intention to reject all recompence for i am naturally benevolent and love doing a good action indeed sir if i were alone in the world i should scorn any remuneration for virtue is its own reward but a real moralist your honour must not forget his duties on any consideration and i have a little family to whom my loss would be an irreparable injury this upon my honour is my only inducement for taking advantage of your generosity and as the moralist ceased he took out of his waistcoat pocket a paper which he handed to me with his usual bow of deference i glanced over itit was a bond apparently drawn up in all the legal formalities pledging myself in case job jonson before the expiration of three days gave that information which should lead to the detection and punishment of the true murderers of sir john tyrrell deceased to ensure to the said job jonson the yearly annuity of three hundred pounds it is with much pleasure that i shall sign this paper said i but allow me par parenthese to observe that since you only accept the annuity for the sake of benefiting your little family in case of your death this annuity ceasing with your life will leave your children as pennyless as at present pardon me your honour rejoined job not a whit daunted at the truth of my remark i can insure i forgot that said i signing and restoring the paper and now to business jonson gravely and carefully looked over the interesting document i returned to him and carefully lapping it in three envelopes inserted it in a huge red pocketbook which he thrust into an innermost pocket in his waistcoat right sir said he slowly to business before i begin you must however promise me upon your honour as a gentleman the strictest secrecy as to my communications i readily agreed to this so far as that secrecy did not impede my present object and job being content with this condition resumed you must forgive me if in order to arrive at the point in question i set out from one which may seem to you a little distant i nodded my assent and job continued i have known dawson for some years my acquaintance with him commenced at newmarket for i have always had a slight tendency to the turf he was a wild foolish fellow easily led into any mischief but ever the first to sneak out of it in short when he became one of us which his extravagance soon compelled him to do we considered him as a very serviceable tool but one that while he was quite wicked enough to begin a bad action was much too weak to go through with it accordingly he was often employed but never trusted by the word us which i see has excited your curiosity i merely mean a body corporate established furtively and restricted solely to exploits on the turf i think it right to mention this because i have the honour to belong to many other societies to which dawson could never have been admitted well sir our club was at last broken up and dawson was left to shift for himself his father was still alive and the young hopeful having quarrelled with him was in the greatest distress he came to me with a pitiful story and a more pitiful face so i took compassion upon the poor devil and procured him by dint of great interest admission into a knot of good fellows whom i visited by the way last night here i took him under my especial care and as far as i could with such a dullheaded dromedary taught him some of the most elegant arts of my profession however the ungrateful dog soon stole back to his old courses and robbed me of half my share of a booty to which i had helped him myself i hate treachery and ingratitude your honour they are so terribly ungentlemanlike i then lost sight of him till between two and three months ago when he returned to town and attended our meetings with tom thornton who had been chosen a member of </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> of the club some months before since we had met dawsons father had died and i thought his flash appearance in town arose from his new inheritance i was mistaken old dawson had tied up the property so tightly that the young one could not scrape enough to pay his debts accordingly before he came to town he gave up his life interest in the property to his creditors however that be master dawson seemed at the top of fortunes wheel he kept his horses and sported the set to champagne and venison in short there would have been no end to his extravagance had not thornton sucked him like a leech it was about that time that i asked dawson for a trifle to keep me from jail for i was ill in bed and could not help myself will you believe sir that the rascal told me to go and be dd and thornton said amen i did not forget the ingratitude of my protege though when i recovered i appeared entirely to do so no sooner could i walk about than i relieved all my necessities he is but a fool who starves with all london before him in proportion as my finances increased dawsons visibly decayed with them decreased also his spirits he became pensive and downcast never joined any of our parties and gradually grew quite a useless member of the corporation to add to his melancholy he was one morning present at the execution of an unfortunate associate of ours this made a deep impression upon him from that moment he became thoroughly moody and despondent he was frequently heard talking to himself could not endure to be left alone in the dark and began rapidly to pine away one night when he and i were seated together he asked me if i never repented of my sins and then added with a groan that i had never committed the heinous crime he had i pressed him to confess but he would not however i coupled that half avowal with his sudden riches and the mysterious circumstances of sir john tyrrells death and dark suspicions came into my mind at that time and indeed ever since dawson reappeared we were often in the habit of discussing the notorious murder which then engrossed public attention and as dawson and thornton had been witnesses on the inquest we frequently referred to them respecting it dawson always turned pale and avoided the subject thornton on the contrary brazened it out with his usual impudence dawsons aversion to the mention of the murder now came into my remembrance with double weight to strengthen my suspicions and on conversing with one or two of our comrades i found that my doubts were more than shared and that dawson had frequently when unusually oppressed with his hypochondria hinted at his committal of some dreadful crime and at his unceasing remorse for it by degrees dawson grew worse and worsehis health decayed he started at a shadowdrank deeply and spoke in his intoxication words that made the hairs of our green men stand on end we must not suffer this said thornton whose hardy effrontery enabled him to lord it over the jolly boys as if he were their dimberdamber his ravings and humdurgeon will unman all our youngsters and so under this pretence thornton had the unhappy man conveyed away to a secret asylum known only to the chiefs of the gang and appropriated to the reception of persons who from the same weakness as dawson were likely to endanger others or themselves there many a poor wretch has been secretly immured and never suffered to revisit the light of heaven the moons minions as well as the monarchs must have their state prisoners and their state victims well sir i shall not detain you much longer last night after your obliging confidence i repaired to the meeting thornton was there and very much out of humour when our messmates dropped off and we were alone at one corner of the room i began talking to him carelessly about his accusation of your friend whom i have since learnt is sir reginald glanvillean old friend of mine too aye you may look sir but i can stake my life to having picked his pocket one night at the opera thornton was greatly surprised at my early intelligence of a fact hitherto kept so profound a secret however i explained it away by a boast of my skill in acquiring information and he then incautiously let out that he was exceedingly vexed with himself for the charge he had made against the prisoner and very uneasy at the urgent inquiries set on foot for dawson more and more convinced of his guilt i quitted the meeting and went to dawsons retreat for fear of his escape thornton had had him closely confined to one of the most secret rooms in the house his solitude and the darkness of the place combined with his remorse had worked upon a mind never too strong almost to insanity he was writhing with the most acute and morbid pangs of conscience that my experience which has been pretty ample ever witnessed the old hag who is the hecate you see sir i have had a classical education of the place was very loth to admit me to him for thornton had bullied her into a great fear of the consequences of disobeying his instructions but she did not dare to resist my orders accordingly i had a long interview with the unfortunate man he firmly believes that thornton intends to murder him and says that if he could escape from his dungeon he would surrender himself up to the first magistrate he could find i told him that an innocent man had been apprehended for the crime of which i knew he and thornton were guilty and then taking upon myself the office of a preacher i exhorted him to atone as far as possible for his past crime by a full and faithful confession that would deliver the innocent and punish the guilty i held out to him the hope that this confession might perhaps serve the purpose of kings evidence and obtain him a pardon for his crime and i promised to use my utmost zeal and diligence to promote his escape from his present den he said in answer that he did not wish to live that he suffered the greatest tortures of mind and that the only comfort earth held out to him would be to ease his remorse by a full acknowledgment of his crime and to hope for future mercy by expiating his offence on the scaffold all this and much more to the same purpose the henhearted fellow told me with sighs and groans i would fain have taken his confession on the spot and carried it away with me but he refused to give it to me or to any one but a parson whose services he implored me to procure him i told him at first that the thing was impossible but moved by his distress and remorse i promised at last to bring one tonight who should both administer spiritual comfort to him and receive his deposition my idea at the moment was to disguise myself in the dress of the pater cove note a parson or ministerbut generally applied to a priest of the lowest order and perform the double jobsince then i have thought of a better scheme as my character you see your honour is not so highly prized by the magistrates as it ought to be any confession made to me might not be of the same value as if it were made to any one elseto a gentleman like you for instance and moreover it will not do for me to appear in evidence against any of the fraternity and for two reasons first because i have taken a solemn oath never to do so and secondly because i have a very fair chance of joining sir john tyrrell in kingdom come if i do my present plan therefore if it meets your concurrence would be to introduce your honour as the parson and for you to receive the confession which indeed you might take down in writing this plan i candidly confess is not without great difficulty and some danger for i have not only to impose you upon dawson as a priest but also upon brimstone bess as one of our jolly boys for i need not tell you that any real parson might knock a long time at her door before it could be opened to him you must therefore be as mum as a mole unless she cants to you and your answers must then be such as i shall dictate otherwise she may detect you and should any of the true men be in the house we should both come off worse than we went in my dear mr job replied i there appears to me to be a much easier plan than all this and that is simply to tell the bowstreet officers where dawson may be found and i think they would be able to carry him away from the arms of mrs brimstone bess without any great difficulty or danger jonson smiled i should not long enjoy my annuity your honour if i were to set the runners upon our best hive i should be stung to death before the week was out even you should you accompany me tonight will never know where the spot is situated nor would you discover it again if you searched all london with the whole police at your back besides dawson is not the only person in the house for whom the law is huntingthere are a score others whom i have no desire to give up to the gallowshid among the odds and ends of the house as snug as plums in a pudding god forbid that i should betray them and for nothing too no your honour the only plan i can think of is the one i proposed if you do not approve of it and it certainly is open to exception i must devise some other </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> other but that may require delay no my good job replied i i am ready to attend you but could we not manage to release dawson as well as take his depositionhis personal evidence is worth all the written ones in the world very true answered job and if it be possible to give bess the slip we will however let us not lose what we may get by grasping at what we may not let us have the confession first and well try for the release afterwards i have another reason for this sir which if you knew as much of penitent prigs as i do you would easily understand however it may be explained by the old proverb of the devil was sick as long as dawson is stowed away in a dark hole and fancies devils in every corner he may be very anxious to make confessions which in broad daylight might not seem to him so desirable darkness and solitude are strange stimulants to the conscience and we may as well not lose any advantage they give us you are an admirable reasoner cried i and i am impatient to accompany youat what hour shall it be not much before midnight answered jonson but your honour must go back to school and learn lessons before then suppose bess were to address you thus well you parish bull prig are you for lushing jackey or pattering in the hum box note well you parson thief are you for drinking gin or talking in the pulpit ill be bound you would not know how to answer i am afraid you are right mr jonson said i in a tone of selfhumiliation never mind replied the compassionate job we are all born ignorantknowledge is not learnt in a day a few of the most common and necessary words in our st giless greek i shall be able to teach you before night and i will beforehand prepare the old lady for seeing a young hand in the profession as i must disguise you before we go and that cannot well be done here suppose you dine with me at my lodgings i shall be too happy said i not a little surprised at the offer i am in charlottestreet bloomsbury no you must ask for me by the name of captain douglas said job with dignity and well dine at five in order to have time for your preliminary initiation with all my heart said i and mr job jonson then rose and reminding me of my promise of secrecy took his departure </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxi pectus praeceptis format amicishorace est quodam prodire tenus si non datur ultrahorace with all my love of enterprise and adventure i cannot say that i should have particularly chosen the project before me for my evenings amusement had i been left solely to my own will but glanvilles situation forbade me to think of self and so far from shrinking at the danger to which i was about to be exposed i looked forward with the utmost impatience to the hour of rejoining jonson there was yet a long time upon my hands before five oclock and the thought of ellen left me in no doubt how it should be passed i went to berkeleysquare lady glanville rose eagerly when i entered the drawingroom have you seen reginald said she or do you know where he has gone to i answered carelessly that he had left town for a few days and i believed merely upon a vague excursion for the benefit of the country air you reassure us said lady glanville we have been quite alarmed by seymours manner he appeared so confused when he told us reginald left town that i really thought some accident had happened to him i sate myself by ellen who appeared wholly occupied in the formation of a purse while i was whispering into her ear words which brought a thousand blushes to her cheek lady glanville interrupted me by an exclamation of have you seen the papers today mr pelham and on my reply in the negative she pointed to an article in the morning herald which she said had occupied their conjectures all the morningit ran thus the evening before last a person of rank and celebrity was privately carried before the magistrate at since then he has undergone an examination the nature of which as well as the name of the individual is as yet kept a profound secret i believe that i have so firm a command over my countenance that i should not change tint nor muscle to hear of the greatest calamity that could happen to me i did not therefore betray a single one of the emotions this paragraph excited within me but appeared on the contrary as much at a loss as lady glanville and wondered and guessed with her till she remembered my present situation in the family and left me alone with ellen why should the teteatete of lovers be so uninteresting to the worldwhen there is scarcely a being in it who has not loved the expressions of every other feeling comes home to us allthe expressions of love weary and fatigue us but the interview of that morning was far from resembling those which the maxims of love at that early period of its existence would assert i could not give myself up to happiness which might so soon be disturbed and though i veiled my anxiety and coldness from ellen i felt it as a crime to indulge even the appearance of transport while glanville lay alone and in prison with the charges of murder yet uncontroverted and the chances of its doom undiminshed the clock had struck four before i left ellens and without returning to my hotel i threw myself into a hackney coach and drove to charlottestreet the worthy job received me with his wonted dignity and ease his lodgings consisted of a first floor furnished according to all the notions of bloomsbury eleganceviz new glaring brussels carpeting convex mirrors with massy gilt frames and eagles at the summit rosewood chairs with chintz cushions bright grates with a flowerpot cut out of yellow paper in each in short all that especial neatness of upholstering paraphernalia which vincent used not inaptly to designate by the title of the teachest taste jonson seemed not a little proud of his apartmentsaccordingly i complimented him upon their elegance under the rose be it spoken said he the landlady who is a widow believes me to be an officer on half pay and thinks i wish to marry her poor woman my black locks and green coat have a witchery that surprises even me who would be a slovenly thief when there are such advantages in being a smart one right mr jonson said i but shall i own to you that i am surprised that a gentleman of your talents should stoop to the lower arts of the profession i always imagined that pickpocketing was a part of your business left only to the plebeian purloiner now i know to my cost that you do not disdain that manual accomplishment your honour speaks like a judge answered job the fact is that i should despise what you rightly designate the lower arts of the profession if i did not value myself upon giving them a charm and investing them with a dignity never bestowed upon them before to give you an idea of the superior dexterity with which i manage my slight of hand know that four times i have been in that shop where you saw me borrow the diamond ring which you now remark upon my little finger and four times have i brought back some token of my visitations nay the shopman is so far from suspecting me that he has twice favoured me with the piteous tale of the very losses i myself brought upon him and i make no doubt that i shall hear in a few days the whole history of the departed diamond now in my keeping coupled with your honours appearance and custom allow that it would be a pity to suffer pride to stand in the way of the talents with which providence has blest me to scorn the little delicacies of art which i execute so well would in my opinion be as absurd as for an epic poet to disdain the composition of a perfect epigram or a consummate musician the melody of a faultless song bravo mr job said i a truly great man you see can confer honour upon trifles more i might have said but was stopt short by the entrance of the landlady who was a fine fair well dressed comely woman of about thirtynine years and eleven months or to speak less precisely between thirty and forty she came to announce that dinner was served below we descended and found a sumptuous repast of roast beef and fish this primary course was succeeded by that great dainty with common peoplea duck and green peas upon my word mr jonson said i you fare like a prince your weekly expenditure must be pretty considerable for a single gentleman i dont know answered jonson with an air of lordly indifferencei have never paid my good hostess any coin but compliments and in all probability never shall was there ever a better illustration of moores admonition o ladies beware of a gay young knight after dinner we remounted to the apartments job emphatically called his own and he then proceeded to initiate me in those phrases of the noble language of flash which might best serve my necessities on the approaching occasion the slang part of my cambridge education had made me acquainted with some little elementary knowledge which rendered jonsons precepts less strange and abstruse in this lecture sweet and holy the hours passed away till it became time for me to dress mr jonson then took me into the penetralia of his bedroom i stumbled against an enormous trunk on hearing the involuntary anathema this accident conjured up to my lips jonson saidah sirdo oblige me by trying to move that box i did so but could not stir it an inch your honour never </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> never saw a jewel box so heavy before i think said jonson with a smile a jewel box i repeated yes returned jonsona jewel box for it is full of precious stones when i go awaynot a little in my good landladys booksi shall desire her very importantly to take the greatest care of my box egad it would be a treasure to macadam he might pound its flinty contents into a street with these words mr jonson unlocked a wardrobe in the room and produced a full suit of rusty black there said he with an air of satisfactionthere this will be your first step to the pulpit i doffed my own attire and with some natural sighs at the deformity of my approaching metamorphosis i slowly inducted myself in the clerical garments they were much too wide and a little too short for me but jonson turned me round as if i were his eldest son breeched for the first timeand declared with an emphatical oath that the clothes fitted me to a hair my host next opened a tin dressing box of large dimensions from which he took sundry powders lotions and paints nothing but my extreme friendship for glanville could ever have supported me through the operation i then underwent my poor complexion thought i with tears in my eyes it is ruined for ever to crown alljonson robbed me by four clips of his scissars of the luxuriant locks which from the pampered indulgence so long accorded to them might have rebelled against the new dynasty which jonson now elected to the crown this consisted of a shaggy but admirably made wig of a sandy colour when i was thus completely attired from head to foot job displayed me to myself before a full length looking glass had i gazed at the reflection for ever i should not have recognized either my form or visage i thought my soul had undergone a real transmigration and not carried to its new body a particle of the original one what appeared the most singular was that i did not seem even to myself at all a ridiculous or outre figure so admirably had the skill of mr jonson been employed i overwhelmed him with encomiums which he took au pied de la lettre never indeed was there a man so vain of being a rogue but said i why this disguise your friends will probably be well versed enough in the mysteries of metamorphosis to see even through your arts and as they have never beheld me before it would very little matter if i went in propria persona true answered job but you dont reflect that without disguise you may hereafter be recognized our friends walk in bondstreet as well as your honour and in that case you might be shot without a second as the saying is you have convinced me said i and now before we start let me say one word further respecting our object i tell you fairly that i think dawsons written deposition but a secondary point and for this reason should it not be supported by any circumstantial or local evidence hereafter to be ascertained it may be quite insufficient fully to acquit glanville in spite of all appearances and criminate the real murderers if therefore it be possible to carry off dawson after having secured his confession we must i think it right to insist more particularly on this point as you appeared to me rather averse to it this morning i say ditto to your honour returned job and you may be sure that i shall do all in my power to effect your object not only from that love of virtue which is implanted in my mind when no stronger inducement leads me astray but from the more worldly reminiscence that the annuity we have agreed upon is only to be given in case of successnot merely for well meaning attempts to say that i have no objection to the release of dawson would be to deceive your honour i own that i have and the objection is first my fear lest he should peach respecting other affairs besides the murder of sir john tyrrell and secondly my scruples as to appearing to interfere with his escape both of these chances expose me to great danger however one does not get three hundred a year for washing ones hands and i must balance the one by the other you are a sensible man mr job said i and i am sure you will richly earn and long enjoy your annuity as i said this the watchman beneath our window called past eleven and jonson starting up hastily changed his own gay gear for a more simple dress and throwing over all a scotch plaid gave me a similar one in which i closely wrapped myself we descended the stairs softly and jonson let us out into the street by the open sesame of a key which he retained about his person </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxii et cantare pares et respondere parativirgil as we walked on into tottenhamcourtroad where we expected to find a hackneycoach my companion earnestly and strenuously impressed on my mind the necessity of implicitly obeying any instructions or hints he might give me in the course of our adventure remember said he forcibly that the least deviation from them will not only defeat our object of removing dawson but even expose our lives to the most imminent peril i faithfully promised to conform to the minutest tittle of his instructions we came to a stand of coaches jonson selected one and gave the coachman an order he took care it should not reach my ears during the half hour we passed in this vehicle job examined and reexamined me in my canting catechism as he termed it he expressed himself much pleased with the quickness of my parts and honoured me with an assurance that in less than three months he would engage to make me as complete a ruffler as ever nailed a swell to this gratifying compliment i made the best return in my power you must not suppose said jonsonsome minutes afterwards from our use of this language that our club consists of the lower order of thievesquite the contrary we are a knot of gentlemen adventurers who wear the best clothes ride the best hacks frequent the best gaming houses as well as the genteelest haunts and sometimes keep the first company in london we are limited in number we have nothing in common with ordinary prigs and should my own little private amusements as you appropriately term them be known in the set i should have a very fair chance of being expelled for ungentlemanlike practices we rarely condescend to speak flash to each other in our ordinary meetings but we find it necessary for many shifts to which fortune sometimes drives us the house you are going this night to visit is a sort of colony we have established for whatever persons amongst us are in danger of bloodmoney rewards for the apprehension of thieves there they sometimes lie concealed for weeks together and are at last shipped off for the continent or enter the world under a new alias to this refuge of the distressed we also send any of the mess who like dawson are troubled with qualms of conscience which are likely to endanger the commonwealth there they remain as in a hospital till death or a cure in short we put the house like its inmates to any purposes likely to frustrate our enemies and serve ourselves old brimstone bess to whom i shall introduce you is as i before said the guardian of the place and the language that respectable lady chiefly indulges in is the one into which you have just acquired so good an insight partly in compliment to her and partly from inclination the dialect adopted in her house is almost entirely flash and you therefore perceive the necessity of appearing not utterly ignorant of a tongue which is not only the language of the country but one with which no true boy however high in his profession is ever unacquainted by the time jonson had finished this speech the coach stoppedi looked eagerly outjonson observed the motion we have not got halfway yet your honour said he we left the coach which jonson requested me to pay and walked on tell me frankly sir said job do you know where you are not in the least replied i looking wistfully up a long dull illlighted street job rolled his sinister eye towards me with a searching look and then turning abruptly to the right penetrated into a sort of covered lane or court which terminated in an alley that brought us suddenly to a stand of three coaches one of these job hailedwe entered ita secret direction was given and we drove furiously on faster than i should think the crazy body of hackney chariot ever drove before i observed that we had now entered a part of the town which was singularly strange to me the houses were old and for the most part of the meanest description we appeared to me to be threading a labyrinth of alleys once i imagined that i caught through a sudden opening a glimpse of the river but we passed so rapidly that my eye might have deceived me at length we stopped the coachman was again dismissed and i again walked onwards under the guidance and almost at the mercy of my honest companion jonson did not address mehe was silent and absorbed and i had therefore full leisure to consider my present situation though thanks to my physical constitution i am as callous to fear as most men a few chilling apprehensions certainly flitted across my mind when i looked round at the dim and dreary shedshouses they were notwhich were on either side of our path only here and there a single lamp shed a sickly light upon the dismal and intersecting lanes though lane is too lofty a word through which our footsteps woke a solitary sound sometimes this feeble light was altogether withheld and i could scarcely catch even the outline of my </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> my companions muscular frame however he strode on through the darkness with the mechanical rapidity of one to whom every stone is familiar i listened eagerly for the sound of the watchmans voice in vainthat note was never heard in those desolate recesses my ear drank in nothing but the sound of our own footsteps or the occasional burst of obscene and unholy merriment from some halfclosed hovel where infamy and vice were holding revels now and then a wretched thing in the vilest extreme of want and loathsomeness and rags loitered by the unfrequent lamps and interrupted our progress with solicitations which made my blood run cold by degrees even these tokens of life ceasedthe last lamp was entirely shut from our viewwe were in utter darkness we are near our journeys end now whispered jonson at these words a thousand unwelcome reflections forced themselves voluntarily on my mind i was about to plunge into the most secret retreat of men whose long habits of villany and desperate abandonment had hardened into a nature which had scarcely a sympathy with my own unarmed and defenceless i was going to penetrate a concealment upon which their lives perhaps depended what could i anticipate from their vengeance but the sure hand and the deadly knife which their selfpreservation would more than justify to such lawless reasoners and who was my companion one who literally gloried in the perfection of his nefarious practices and who if he had stopped short of the worst enormities seemed neither to disown the principle upon which they were committed nor to balance for a moment between his interest and his conscience nor did he attempt to conceal from me the danger to which i was exposed much as his daring habits of life and the good fortune which had attended him must have hardened his nerves even he seemed fully sensible of the peril he incurreda peril certainly considerably less than that which attended my temerity bitterly did i repent as these reflections rapidly passed my mind my negligence in not providing myself with a single weapon in case of need the worst pang of death is the falling without a struggle however it was no moment for the indulgence of fear it was rather one of those eventful periods which so rarely occur in the monotony of common life when our minds are sounded to their utmost depths and energies of which we dreamt not when at rest in their secret retreats arise like spirits at the summons of the wizard and bring to the invoking mind an unlooked for and preternatural aid there was something too in the disposition of my guide which gave me a confidence in him not warranted by the occupations of his life an easy and frank boldness an ingenuous vanity of abilities skilfully though dishonestly exerted which had nothing of the meanness and mystery of an ordinary villain and which being equally prominent with the rascality they adorned prevented the attention from dwelling only upon the darker shades of his character besides i had so closely entwined his interest with my own that i felt there could be no possible ground either for suspecting him of any deceit towards me or of omitting any art or exertion which could conduce to our mutual safety or our common end forcing myself to dwell solely upon the more encouraging side of the enterprise i had undertaken we continued to move on silent and in darkness for some minutes longerjonson then halted are you quite prepared sir said he in a whisper if your heart fails in gods name let us turn back the least evident terror will be as much as your life is worth my thoughts were upon sir reginald and ellen as i replied you have told and convinced me that i may trust is you and i have no fears my present object is one as strong to me as life i would we had a glim rejoined job musingly i should like to see your face but will you give me your hand sir i did and jonson held it in his own for more than a minute fore heaven sir said he at last i would you were one of us you would live a brave man and die a game one your pulse is like iron and your hand does not swaynonot so much as to wave a doves feather it would be a burning shame if harm came to so stout a heart job moved on a few steps now sir he whispered remember your flash do exactly as i may have occasion to tell you and be sure to sit away from the light should we be in company with these words he stopped i perceived by the touch for it was too dark to see that he was leaning down apparently in a listening attitude presently he tapped five times at what i supposed was a door though i afterwards discovered it was the shutter to a window upon this a faint light broke through the crevices of the boards and a low voice uttered some sound which my ear did not catch job replied in the same key and in words which were perfectly unintelligible to me the light disappeared job moved round as if turning a corner i heard the heavy bolts and bars of a door slowly withdraw and in a few moments a harsh voice said in the thieves dialect ruffling job my prince of prigs is that you are you come to the ken alone or do you carry double ah bess my covess strike me blind if my sees dont tout your bingo muns in spite of the darkmans egad you carry a bane blink aloft come to the ken aloneno my blowen did not i tell you i should bring a pater cove to chop up the whiners for dawson stubble it you ben you deserve to cly the jerk for your patter come in and be dd to you upon this invitation jonson seizing me by the arm pushed me into the house and followed go for a glim bess to light in the parish bull with proper respect ill close the gig of the crib at this order delivered in an authoritative tone the old woman mumbling strange oaths to herself moved away when she was out of hearing job whispered mark i shall leave the bolts undrawn the door opens with a latch which you press thusdo not forget the spring it is easy but peculiar should you be forced to run for it you will also remember above all when you are out of the door to turn to the right and go straight forwards the old woman now reappeared with a light and jonson ceased and moved hastily towards her i followed the old woman asked whether the door had been carefully closed and jonson with an oath at her doubts of such a matter answered in the affirmative we proceeded onwards through a long and very narrow passage till bess opened a small door to the left and introduced us into a large room which to my great dismay i found already occupied by four men who were sitting half immersed in smoke by an oak table with a capacious bowl of hot liquor before them at the back ground of this room which resembled the kitchen of a public house was an enormous skreen of antique fashion a low fire burnt sullenly in the grate and beside it was one of those highbacked chairs seem frequently in old houses and old pictures a clock stood in one corner and in the opposite nook were a flight of narrow stairs which led downwards probably to a cellar on a row of shelves were various bottles of the different liquors generally in request among the flash gentry together with an oldfashioned fiddle two bridles and some strange looking tools probably of more use to true boys than honest men brimstone bess was a woman about the middle size but with bones and sinews which would not have disgraced a prizefighter a cap that might have been cleaner was rather thrown than put on the back of her head developing to full advantage the few scanty locks of grizzled ebon which adorned her countenance her eyes large black and prominent sparkled with a fire half vivacious half vixen the nasal feature was broad and fungous and as well as the whole of her capacious physiognomy blushed with the deepest scarlet it was evident to see that many a full bottle of british compounds had contributed to the feeding of that burning and phosphoric illumination which was indeed the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace the expression of the countenance was not wholly bad amidst the deep traces of searing vice and unrestrained passion amidst all that was bold and unfeminine and fierce and crafty there was a latent look of coarse good humour a twinkle of the eye that bespoke a tendency to mirth and drollery and an upward curve of the lip that shewed however the human creature might be debased it still cherished its grand characteristicthe propensity to laughter the garb of this dame leonarda was by no means of that humble nature which one might have supposed a gown of crimson silk flounced and furbelowed to the knees was tastefully relieved by a bright yellow shawl and a pair of heavy pendants glittered in her ears which were of the size proper to receive the big words they were in the habit of hearing probably this finery had its origin in the policy of her guests who had seen enough of life to know that age which tames all other passions never tames the passion of dress in a womans mind no sooner did the four revellers set their eyes upon me than they all rose zounds bess cried the tallest of them what culls this is this a bowsing ken for every cove to shove his trunk in what ho my kiddy cried job dont be glimflashy why youd cry beef on a blater the cove is a bob cull and a pal of my own and moreover </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> moreover is as pretty a tyburn blossom as ever was brought up to ride a horse foaled by an acorn upon this commendatory introduction i was forthwith surrounded and one of the four proposed that i should be immediately elected this motion which was probably no gratifying ceremony job negatived with a dictatorial air and reminded his comrades that however they might find it convenient to lower themselves occasionally yet that they were gentlemen sharpers and not vulgar cracksmen and clyfakers and that therefore they ought to welcome me with the good breeding appropriate to their station upon this hint which was received with mingled laughter and deference for job seemed to be a man of might among these philistines the tallest of the set who bore the euphonious appellation of spidershanks politely asked me if i would blow a cloud with him and upon my assentfor i thought such an occupation would be the best excuse for silencehe presented me with a pipe of tobacco to which dame brimstone applied a light and i soon lent my best endeavours to darken still further the atmosphere around us mr job jonson then began artfully to turn the conversation away from me to the elder confederates of his crew these were all spoken of under certain singular appellations which might well baffle impertinent curiosity the name of one was the gimblet another crack crib a third the magician a fourth cherry coloured jowl the tallest of the present company was called as i before said spidershanks and the shortest fib fakescrew job himself was honoured by the venerabile nomen of guinea pig at last job explained the cause of my appearance viz his wish to pacify dawsons conscience by dressing up one of the pals whom the sinner could not recognize as an autem bawler and so obtaining him the benefit of the clergy without endangering the gang by his confession this detail was received with great good humour and job watching his opportunity soon after rose and turning to me said toddle my bob cull we must track up the dancers and tout the sinner i wanted no other hint to leave my present situation the ruffian cly thee guinea pig for stashing the lush said spidershanks helping himself out of the bowl which was nearly empty stash the lush cried mrs brimstone aye and toddle off to ruggins why you would not be boosing till lightmans in a square crib like mine as if you were in a flash panny thats bang up mort cried fib a square crib indeed aye square as mr newmans courtyardding boys on three sides and the crap on the fourth this characteristic witticism was received with great applause and jonson taking a candlestick from the fair fingers of the exasperated mrs brimstone the hand thus conveniently released immediately transferred itself to fibs cheeks with so hearty a concussion that it almost brought the rash jester to the ground jonson and i lost not a moment in taking advantage of the confusion this gentle remonstrance appeared to occasion but instantly left the room and closed the door </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxiii tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage beshakspeare we proceeded a short way when we were stopped by a door this job opened and a narrow staircase lighted from above by a dim lamp was before us we ascended and found ourselves in a sort of gallery here hung another lamp beneath which job opened a closet this is the place where bess generally leaves the keys said he we shall find them here i hope so saying master job entered leaving me in the passage but soon returned with a disappointed air the old harridan has left them below said he i must go down for them your honour will wait here till i return suiting the action to the word honest job immediately descended leaving me alone with my own reflections just opposite to the closet was the door of some apartment i leant accidentally against it it was only ajar and gave way the ordinary consequence in such accidents is a certain precipitation from the centre of gravity i am not exempt from the general lot and accordingly entered the room in a manner entirely contrary to that which my natural inclination would have prompted me to adopt my ear was accosted by a faint voice which proceeded from a bed at the opposite corner it asked in the thieves dialect and in the feeble accents of bodily weakness who was there i did not judge it necessary to make any reply but was withdrawing as gently as possible when my eye rested upon a table at the foot of the bed upon which among two or three miscellaneous articles were deposited a brace of pistols and one of those admirable swords made according to the modern military regulation for the united purpose of cut and thrust the light which enabled me to discover the contents of the room proceeded from a rushlight placed in the grate this general symptom of a valetudinarian together with some other little odd matters combined with the weak voice of the speaker impressed me with the idea of having intruded into the chamber of some sick member of the crew emboldened by this notion and by perceiving that the curtains were drawn closely around the bed so that the inmate could have optical discernment of nothing that occurred without i could not resist taking two soft steps to the table and quietly removing a weapon whose bright face seemed to invite me as a long known and long tried friend this was not however done in so noiseless a manner but what the voice again addressed me in a somewhat louder key by the appellation of brimstone bess asking with sundry oaths what was the matter and requesting something to drink i need scarcely say that as before i made no reply but crept out of the room as gently as possible blessing my good fortune for having thrown into my way a weapon with the use of which above all others i was best acquainted scarcely had i regained the passage before jonson reappeared with the keys i showed him my treasure for indeed it was of no size to conceal are you mad sir said he or do you think that the best way to avoid suspicion is to walk about with a drawn sword in your hand i would not have bess see you for the best diamond i ever borrowed with these words job took the sword from my reluctant hand where did you get it said he i explained in a whisper and job reopening the door i had so unceremoniously entered laid the weapon softly on a chair that stood within reach the sick man whose senses were of course rendered doubly acute by illness once more demanded in a fretful tone who was there and job replied in the flash language that bess had sent him up to look for her keys which she imagined she had left there the invalid rejoined by a request to jonson to reach him a draught and we had to undergo a farther delay until his petition was complied with we then proceeded up the passage till we came to another flight of steps which led to a door job opened it and we entered a room of no common dimensions this said he is bess brimstones sleeping apartment whoever goes into the passage that leads not only to dawsons room but to the several other chambers occupied by such of the gang as require particular care must pass first through this room you see that bell by the bedsidei assure you it is no ordinary tintannabulum it communicates with every sleeping apartment in the house and is only rung in cases of great alarm when every boy must look well to himself there are two more of this description one in the room which we have just left another in the one occupied by spidershanks who is our watchdog and keeps his kennel below those steps in the common room which seem to lead to a cellar conduct to his den as we shall have to come back through this room you see the difficulty of smuggling dawsonand if the old dame rung the alarm the whole hive would be out in a moment after this speech job left the room by opening a door at the opposite end which shewed us a passage similar in extent and fashion to the one we had left below at the very extremity of this was the entrance to an apartment at which jonson stopped here said he taking from his pocket a small paper book and an inkhorn here your honour take these you may want to note the heads of dawsons confession we are now at his door job then applied one of the keys of a tolerably sized bunch to the door and the next moment we were in dawsons apartment the room which though low and narrow was of considerable length was in utter darkness and the dim and flickering light jonson held only struggled with rather than penetrated the thick gloom about the centre of the room stood the bed and sitting upright on it with a wan and hollow countenance bent eagerly towards us was a meagre attenuated figure my recollection of dawson whom it will be remembered i had only seen once before was extremely faint but it had impressed me with the idea of a middle sized and rather athletic man with a fair and florid complexion the creature i now saw was totally the reverse of this idea his cheeks were yellow and drawn in his hand which was raised in the act of holding aside the curtains was like the talons of a famished vulture so thin so long so withered in its hue and texture no sooner did the advancing light allow him to see us distinctly than he half sprung from the bed and cried in that peculiar tone of joy which seems to throw off from the breast a suffocating weight of previous terror and suspense thank god thank god </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> god it is you at last and you have brought the clergymangod bless you jonson you are a true friend to me cheer up dawson said job i have smuggled in this worthy gentleman who i have no doubt will be of great comfort to youbut you must be open with him and tell all that i willthat i will cried dawson with a wild and vindictive expression of countenanceif it be only to hang him here jonson give me your hand bring the light neareri sayhe the devilthe fiendhas been here today and threatened to murder me and i have listened and listened all night and thought i heard his step along the passage and up the stairs and at the door but it was nothing job nothingand you are come at last good kind worthy job oh tis so horrible to be left in the dark and not sleepand in this large large room which looks like eternity at nightand one does fancy such sights jobsuch horrid horrid sights feel my wristband jonson and here at my back you would think they had been pouring water over me but its only the cold sweat oh it is a fearful thing to have a bad conscience job but you wont leave me till daylight now thats a dear good job for shame dawson said jonson pluck up and be a man you are like a baby frightened by its nurse heres the clergyman come to heal your poor wounded conscience will you hear him now yes said dawson yesbut go out of the roomi cant tell all if youre here go job gobut youre not angry with mei dont mean to offend you angry said job lord help the poor fellow no to be sure not ill stay outside the door till youve done with the clergymanbut make haste for the nights almost over and its as much as the parsons life is worth to stay here after daybreak i will make haste said the guilty man tremulously but job where are you goingwhat are you doing leave the lighthere job by the bedside job did as he was desired and quitted the room leaving the door not so firmly shut but that he might hear if the penitent spoke aloud every particular of his confession i seated myself on the side of the bed and taking the skeleton hand of the unhappy man spoke to him in the most consolatory and comforting words i could summon to my assistance he seemed greatly soothed by my efforts and at last implored me to let him join me in prayer i knelt down and my lips readily found words for that language which whatever be the formula of our faith seems in all emotions which come home to our hearts the most natural method of expressing them it is here by the bed of sickness or remorse that the ministers of god have their real power it is here that their office is indeed a divine and unearthly mission and that in breathing balm and comfort in healing the broken heart in raising the crushed and degraded spiritthey are the voice and oracle of the father who made us in benevolence and will judge of us in mercy i rose and after a short pause dawson who expressed himself impatient of the comfort of confession thus began i have no time sir to speak of the earlier part of my life i passed it upon the racecourse and at the gamingtableall that was i know very wrong and wicked but i was a wild idle boy and eager for any thing like enterprise or mischief well sir it is now more than three years ago since i first met one tom thornton it was at a boxing match tom was chosen chairman at a sort of club of the farmers and yeomen and being a lively amusing fellow and accustomed to the company of gentlemen was a great favourite with all of us he was very civil to me and i was quite pleased with his notice i did not however see much of him then nor for more than two years afterwards but some months ago we met again i was in very poor circumstances so was he and this made us closer friends than we might otherwise have been he lived a great deal at the gamblinghouses and fancied he had discovered a certain method of winning note a very common delusion both among sharpers and their prey at hazard so whenever he could not find a gentleman whom he could cheat with false dice tricks at cards he would go into any hell to try his infallible game i did not however perceive that he made a good livelihood by it and though sometimes either by that method or some other he had large sums of money in his possession yet they were spent as soon as acquired the fact was that he was not a man who could ever grow rich he was extremely extravagant in all thingsloved women and drinking and was always striving to get into the society of people above him in order to do this he affected great carelessness of money and if at a race or a cockfight any real gentlemen would go home with him he would insist upon treating them to the very best of every thing thus sir he was always poor and at his wits end for means to supply his extravagance he introduced me to three or four gentlemen as he called them but whom i have since found to be markers sharpers and blacklegs and this set soon dissipated the little honesty my own habits of life had left me they never spoke of things by their right names and therefore those things never seemed so bad as they really wereto swindle a gentleman did not sound a crime when it was called macing a swellnor transportation a punishment when it was termed with a laugh lagging a cove thus insensibly my ideas of right and wrong always obscure became perfectly confused and the habit of treating all crimes as subjects of jest in familiar conversation soon made me regard them as matters of very trifling importance well sir at newmarket races this spring meeting thornton and i were on the look out he had come down to stay during the races at a house i had just inherited from my father but which was rather an expense to me than an advantage especially as my wife who was an innkeepers daughter was very careless and extravagant it so happened that we were both taken in by a jockey whom we had bribed very largely and were losers to a very considerable amount among other people i lost to a sir john tyrrell i expressed my vexation to thornton who told me not to mind it but to tell sir john that i would pay him if he came to the town and that he was quite sure we could win enough by his certain game at hazard to pay off my debt he was so very urgent that i allowed myself to be persuaded though thornton has since told me that his only motive was to prevent sir johns going to the marquess of chesters where he was invited with my lords party and so to have an opportunity of accomplishing the crime he then meditated accordingly as thornton desired i asked sir john tyrrell to come with me to newmarket he did so i left him joined thornton and went to the gamblinghouse here we were engaged in thorntons sure game when sir john entered i went up and apologized for not paying and said i would pay him in three months however sir john was very angry and treated me with such rudeness that the whole table remarked it when he was gone i told thornton how hurt and indignant i was at sir johns treatment he incensed me still moreexaggerated sir johns conductsaid that i had suffered the grossest insult and at last put me into such a passion that i said that if i was a gentleman i would fight sir john tyrrell across a table when thornton saw i was so moved he took me out of the room and carried me to an inn here he ordered dinner and several bottles of wine i never could bear much drink he knew this and artfully plied me with wine till i scarcely knew what i did or said he then talked much of our destitute situationaffected to put himself out of the questionsaid he was a single man and could easily make shift upon a potatoebut that i was encumbered with a wife and child whom i could not suffer to starve he then said that sir john tyrrell had publicly disgraced methat i should be blown upon the coursethat no gentleman would bet with me again and a great deal more of the same sort seeing what an effect he had produced upon me he then told me that he had seen sir john receive a large sum of money that would more than pay our debts and set us up like gentlemen and at last he proposed to me to rob him intoxicated as i was i was somewhat startled at this proposition however the slang terms in which thornton disguised the greatness and danger of the offence very much diminished both in my eyesso at length i consented we went to sir johns inn and learnt that he had just set out accordingly we mounted our horses and rode after him the night had already closed in after we had got some distance from the main road into a lane which led both to my house and to chester parkfor the former was on the direct way to my lordswe passed a man on horseback i only observed that he was wrapped in a cloakbut thornton said directly we had passed him i know that man wellhe has been following tyrrell all dayand though he attempts to screen himself i have penetrated his disguise he is tyrrells mortal enemy should the worst come to the worst added thornton words which i </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> i did not at that moment understand we can make him bear the blame when we had got some way further we came up to tyrrell and a gentleman whom to our great dismay we found that sir john had joinedthe gentlemans horse had met with an accident and thornton dismounted to offer his assistance he assured the gentleman who proved afterwards to be a mr pelham that the horse was quite lame and that he would scarcely be able to get it home and he then proposed to sir john to accompany us and said that we would put him in the right road this offer sir john rejected very haughtily and we rode on its all up with us said i since he has joined another person not at all replied thornton for i managed to give the horse a sly poke with my knife and if i know any thing of sir john tyrrell he is much too impatient a spark to crawl along a snails pace with any companion especially with this heavy shower coming on but said i for i now began to recover from my intoxication and to be sensible of the nature of our undertaking the moon is up and unless this shower conceals it sir john will recognize us so you see even if he leaves the gentleman it will be no use and we had much better make haste home and go to bed upon this thornton cursed me for a fainthearted fellow and said that the cloud would effectually hide the moonor if nothe addedi know how to silence a prating tongue at these words i was greatly alarmed and said that if he meditated murder as well as robbery i would have nothing further to do with it thornton laughed and told me not to be a fool while we were thus debating a heavy shower came on we rode hastily to a large tree by the side of a pondwhich though bare and withered was the nearest shelter the country afforded and was only a very short distance from my house i wished to go homebut thornton would not let me and as i was always in the habit of yielding i stood with him though very reluctantly under the tree presently we heard the trampling of a horse it is heit is he cried thornton with a savage tone of exultationand alonebe readywe must make a rushi will be the one to bid him to deliveryou hold your tongue the clouds and rain had so overcast the night that although it was not perfectly dark it was sufficiently obscure to screen our countenances just as tyrrell approached thornton dashed forward and cried in a feigned voicestand on your peril i followed and we were now both by sir johns side he attempted to push by usbut thornton seized him by the armthere was a stout struggle in which as yet i had no shareat last tyrrell got loose from thornton and i seized himhe set spurs to his horse which was a very spirited and strong animalit reared upwards and very nearly brought me and my horse to the groundat that instant thornton struck the unfortunate man a violent blow across the head with the butt end of his heavy whipsir johns hat had fallen before in the struggle and the blow was so stunning that it felled him upon the spot thornton dismounted and made me do the samethere is no time to lose said he let us drag him from the roadside and rifle him we accordingly carried him he was still senseless to the side of the pond before mentionedwhile we were searching for the money thornton spoke of the storm ceased and the moon broke outwe were detained some moments by the accident of tyrrells having transferred his pocketbook from the pocket thornton had seen him put it in on the race ground to an inner one we had just discovered and seized the pocketbook when sir john awoke from his swoon and his eyes opened upon thornton who was still bending over him and looking at the contents of the book to see that all was right the moonlight left tyrrell in no doubt as to our persons and struggling hard to get up he cried i know you i know you you shall hang for this no sooner had he uttered this imprudence than it was all over with him we will see that sir john said thornton setting his knee upon tyrrells chest and nailing him down while thus employed he told me to feel in his coatpocket for a caseknife for gods sake cried tyrrell with a tone of agonizing terror which haunts me still spare my life it is too late said thornton deliberately and taking the knife from my hands he plunged it into sir johns side and as the blade was too short to reach the vitals thornton drew it backwards and forwards to widen the wound tyrrell was a strong man and still continued to struggle and call out for mercythornton drew out the knifetyrrell seized it by the blade and his fingers were cut through before thornton could snatch it from his grasp the wretched gentleman then saw all hope was over he uttered one loud sharp cry of despair thornton put one hand to his mouth and with the other gashed his throat from ear to ear you have done for him and for us now said i as thornton slowly rose from the body no replied he look he still moves and sure enough he did but it was in the last agony however thornton to make all sure plunged the knife again into his body the blade came into contact with a bone and snapped in two so great was the violence of the blow that instead of remaining in the flesh the broken piece fell upon the ground among the long fern and grass while we were employed in searching for it thornton whose ears were much sharper than mine caught the sound of a horse mount mount he cried and let us be off we sprung up on our horses and rode away as fast as we could i wished to go home as it was so near at hand but thornton insisted on making to an old shed about a quarter of a mile across the fields thither therefore we went stop said i what did thornton do with the remaining part of the caseknife did he throw it away or carry it with him he took it with him answered dawson for his name was engraved on a silver plate on the handle and he was therefore afraid of throwing it into the pond as i advised lest at any time it should be discovered close by the shed there is a plantation of young firs of some extent thornton and i entered and he dug a hole with the broken blade of the knife and buried it covering up the hole again with the earth describe the place said i dawson paused and seemed to recollect i was on the very tenterhooks of suspence for i saw with one glance all the importance of his reply after some moments he shook his head i cannot describe the place said he for the wood is so thick yet i know the exact spot so well that were i in any part of the plantation i could point it out immediately i told him to pause again and recollect himself and at all events to try to indicate the place however his account was so confused and perplexed that i was forced to give up the point in despair and he continued after we had done this thornton told me to hold the horses and said he would go alone to spy whether we might return accordingly he did so and brought back word in about half an hour that he had crept cautiously along till in sight of the place and then throwing himself down on his face by the ridge of a bank had observed a man whom he was sure was the person with a cloak we had passed and whom he said was sir reginald glanville mount his horse on the very spot of the murder and ride off while another person mr pelham appeared and also discovered the fatal place there is no doubt now said he that we shall have the hueand cry upon us however if you are staunch and stouthearted no possible danger can come to us for you may leave me alone to throw the whole guilt upon sir reginald glanville we then mounted and rode home we stole up stairs by the backwaythorntons linen and hands were stained with blood the former he took off locked up carefully and burnt the first opportunity the latter he washed and that the water might not lead to detection drank it we then appeared as if nothing had occurred and learnt that mr pelham had been to the house but as very fortunately our outbuildings had been lately robbed by some idle people the wife and servants had refused to admit him i was thrown into great agitation and was extremely frightened however as mr pelham had left a message that we were to go to the pond thornton insisted upon our repairing there to avoid suspicion dawson then proceeded to say that on their return as he was still exceedingly nervous thornton insisted on his going to bed when our party from lord chesters came to the house thornton went into dawsons room and made him swallow a large tumbler of brandy note a common practice with thieves who fear the weak nerves of their accomplices this intoxicated him so as to make him less sensible to his dangerous situation afterwards when the picture was found which circumstance thornton communicated to him along with that of the threatening letter sent by glanville to the deceased which was discovered in tyrrells pocketbook dawson recovered courage and justice being entirely thrown on a wrong scent he managed to pass his examination without suspicion he then went to town with thornton and constantly attended the club to which </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> which jonson had before introduced him at first among his new comrades and while the novel flush of the money he had so fearfully acquired lasted he partially succeeded in stifling his remorse but the success of crime is too contrary to nature to continue long his poor wife whom in spite of her extravagant and his dissolute habits he seemed really to love fell ill and died on her deathbed she revealed the suspicions she had formed of his crime and said that those suspicions had preyed upon and finally destroyed her health this awoke him from the guilty torpor of his conscience his share of the money too the greater part of which thornton had bullied out of him was gone he fell as job had said into despondency and gloom and often spoke to thornton so forcibly of his remorse and so earnestly of his gnawing and restless desire to appease his mind by surrendering himself to justice that the fears of that villain grew at length so thoroughly alarmed as to procure his removal to his present abode it was here that his real punishment commenced closely confined to his apartment at the remotest corner of the house his solitude was never broken but by the short and hurried visits of his female gaoler and worse even than loneliness the occasional invasions of thornton there appeared to be in that abandoned wretch what for the honour of human nature is but rarely found viz a love of sin not for its objects but itself with a malignity doubly fiendish from its inutility he forbade dawson the only indulgence he craveda light during the dark hours and not only insulted him for his cowardice but even added to his terrors by threats of effectually silencing them these fears had so wildly worked upon the mans mind that prison itself appeared to him an elysium to the hell he endured and when his confession was ended i said if you can be freed from this place would you repeat before a magistrate all that you have now told me he started up in delight at the very thought in truth besides his remorse and that inward and impelling voice which in all the annals of murder seems to urge the criminal onwards to the last expiation of his guiltbesides these there mingled in his mind a sentiment of bitter yet cowardly vengeance against his inhuman accomplice and perhaps he found consolation for his own fate in the hope of wreaking upon thorntons head somewhat of the tortures that ruffian had inflicted upon him i had taken down in my book the heads of the confession and i now hastened to jonson who waiting without the door had as i had anticipated heard all you see said i that however satisfactory this recital has been it contains no secondary or innate proofs to confirm it the only evidence with which it could furnish us would be the remnant of the broken knife engraved with thorntons name but you have heard from dawsons account how impossible it would be in an extensive wood for any to discover the spot but himself you will agree with me therefore that we must not leave this house without dawson job changed colour slightly i see as clearly as you do said he that it will be necessary for my annuity and your friends full acquittal to procure dawsons personal evidence but it is late now the men may be still drinking below bess may be still awake and stirring even if she sleeps how could we pass her room without disturbing her i own that i do not see a chance of effecting his escape tonight without incurring the most probable peril of having our throats cut leave it therefore to me to procure his release as soon as possibleprobably tomorrow and let us now quietly retire content with what we have yet got hitherto i had implicitly obeyed job it was now my turn to command look you said i calmly but sternly i have come into this house under your guidance solely to procure the evidence of that man the evidence he has as yet given may not be worth a straw and since i have ventured among the knives of your associates it shall be for some purpose i tell you fairly that whether you befriend or betray me i will either leave these walls with dawson or remain in them a corpse you are a bold blade sir said jonson who seemed rather to respect than resent the determination of my tone and we will see what can be done wait here your honour while i go down to see if the boys are gone to bed and the coast is clear job descended and i reentered dawsons room when i told him that we were resolved if possible to effect his escape nothing could exceed his transport and gratitude this was indeed expressed in so mean and servile a manner mixed with so many petty threats of vengeance against thornton that i could scarcely conceal my disgust jonson returned and beckoned me out of the room they are all in bed sir said hebess as well as the rest indeed the old girl has lushed so well at the bingo that she sleeps as if her next morrow was the day of judgment i have also seen that the street door is still unbarred so that upon the whole we have perhaps as good a chance tonight as we may ever have again all my fear is about that cowardly lubber i have left both besss doors wide open so we have nothing to do but to creep through as for me i am an old file and could steal my way through a sick mans room like a sunbeam through a keyhole well said i in the same strain i am no elephant and my dancing master used to tell me i might tread on a butterflys wing without brushing off a tint poor coulon he little thought of the use his lessons would be to me hereafterso let us be quick master job stop said jonson i have yet a ceremony to perform with our caged bird i must put a fresh gag on his mouth for though if he escapes i must leave england perhaps for ever for fear of the jolly boys and therefore care not what he blabs about me yet there are a few fine fellows amongst the club whom i would not have hurt for the indies so i shall make master dawson take our last oaththe devil himself would not break that i think your honour will stay outside the door for we can have no witness while it is administered job then entered i stood withoutin a few minutes i heard dawsons voice in the accents of supplication soon after job returned the craven dog wont take the oath said he and may my right hand rot above ground before it shall turn key for him unless he does but when dawson saw that job had left the room and withdrawn the light the consciencestricken coward came to the door and implored job to return will you swear then said jonson i will i will was the answer job then reenteredminutes passed awayjob reappeared and dawson was dressed and clinging hold of himalls right said he to me with a satisfied air the oath had been takenwhat it was i know notbut it was never broken note those conversant with the annals of newgate will know how religiously the oaths of these fearful freemasonries are kept dawson and job went firsti followedwe passed the passage and came to the chamber of the sleeping mrs brimstone job leant eagerly forward to listen before we entered he took hold of dawsons arm and beckoning to me to follow stole with a step that a blind mole would not have heard across the room carefully did the practised thief veil the candle he carried with his hand as he now began to pass by the bed i saw that dawson trembled like a leaf and the palpitation of his limbs made his step audible and heavy just as they had halfway passed the bed i turned my look on brimstone bess and observed with a shuddering thrill her eyes slowly open and fix upon the forms of my companions dawsons gaze had been bent in the same direction and when he met the full glassy stare of the beldames eyes he uttered a faint scream this completed our danger had it not been for that exclamation bess might in the uncertain vision of drowsiness have passed over the third person and fancied it was only myself and jonson in our way from dawsons apartment but no sooner had her ear caught the sound than she started up and sat erect on her bed gazing at us in mingled wrath and astonishment that was a fearful momentwe stood rivetted to the spot oh my kiddies cried bess at last finding speech you are in queerstreet i trow plant your stumps master guinea pig you are going to stall off the daws baby in prime twig eh but bess stags you my cove bess stags you jonson looked irresolute for one instant but the next he had decided run run cried he for your lives and he and dawson to whom fear did indeed lend wings were out of the room in an instant i lost no time in following their example but the vigilant and incensed hag was too quick for me she pulled violently the bell on which she had already placed her hand the alarm rang like an echo in a cavern belowaroundfarnearfrom wall to wallfrom chamber to chamber the sound seemed multiplied and repeated and in the same breathing point of time she sprang from her bed and seized me just as i had reached the door on on on cried jonsons voice to dawson as they had already gained the passage and left the whole room and the staircase beyond in utter darkness with a firm muscular nervous gripe which almost shewed a masculine strength the hag clung to my throat and breast behind </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> behind among some of the numerous rooms in the passage we had left i heard sounds which told too plainly how rapidly the alarm had spread a door openedsteps approachedmy fate seemed fixed but despair gave me energy it was no time for the ceremonials due to the beau sexe i dashed bess to the ground tore myself from her relaxing grasp and fled down the steps with all the precipitation the darkness would allow i gained the passage at the far end of which hung the lamp now weak and waning in its socket which it will be remembered burnt close by the sick mans chamber that i had so unintentionally entered a thought flashed upon my mind and lent me new nerves and fresh speed i flew along the passage guided by the dying light the staircase i had left shook with the footsteps of my pursuers i was at the door of the sick thiefi burst it openseized the sword as it lay within reach on the chair where jonson had placed it and feeling at the touch of the familiar weapon as if the might of ten men had been transferred to my single arm i bounded down the stairs before mepassed the door at the bottom which dawson had fortunately left openflung it back almost upon the face of my advancing enemies and found myself in the long passage which led to the streetdoor in safety but in the thickest darkness a light flashed from a door to the left the door was that of the common room which we had first entered it opened and spidershanks with one of his comrades looked forth the former holding a light i darted by them and guided by their lamp fled along the passage and reached the door imagine my dismay when either through accident or by the desire of my fugitive companions to impede pursuit i found it unexpectedly closed the two villains had now come up to me close at their heels were two more probably my pursuers from the upper apartments providentially the passage was as i before said extremely narrow and as long as no firearms were used nor a general rush resorted to i had little doubt of being able to keep the ruffians at bay until i had hit upon the method of springing the latch and so winning my escape from the house while my left hand was employed in feeling the latch i made such good use of my right as to keep my antagonists at a safe distance the one who was nearest to me was fib fakescrew he was armed with a weapon exactly similar to my own the whole passage rung with oaths and threats crash the culldown with himdown with him before he dubs the jigger tip him the degen fib fake him through and through if he pikes we shall all be scragged hitherto in the confusion i had not been able to recall jobs instructions in opening the latch at last i remembered and pressed the screwthe latch rosei opened the door but not wide enough to scape through the aperture the ruffians saw my escape at hand rush the bcove rush him cried the loud voice of one behind and at the word fib was thrown forwards upon the extended edge of my blade scarcely with an effort of my own arm the sword entered his bosom and he fell at my feet bathed in blood the motion which the men thought would prove my destruction became my salvation staggered by the fall of their companion they gave way i seized advantage of the momentary confusionthrew open the door and mindful of jobs admonition turned to the right and fled onwards with a rapidity which baffled and mocked pursuit </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxiv ille viam secat ad naves sociosque revisitvirgil the day had already dawned but all was still and silent my footsteps smote the solitary pavement with a strange and unanswered sound nevertheless though all pursuit had long ceased i still continued to run on mechanically till faint and breathless i was forced into pausing i looked round but could recognize nothing familiar in the narrow and filthy streets even the names of them were to me like an unknown language after a brief rest i renewed my wanderings and at length came to an alley called river lane the name did not deceive me but brought me after a short walk to the thames there to my inexpressible joy i discovered a solitary boatman and transported myself forthwith to the whitehallstairs never i ween did gay gallant in the decaying part of the season arrive at those stairs for the sweet purpose of accompanying his own mistress or anothers wife to green richmond or sunny hampton with more eager and animated delight than i felt at rejecting the arm of the rough boatman and leaping on the wellknown stones i hastened to that stand of jarvies which has often been the hope and shelter of belated member of st stephens or bewetted fugitive from the opera i startled a sleeping coachman flung myself into his vehicle and descended at mivarts the drowsy porter surveyed and told me to be gone i had forgotten my strange attire pooh my friend said i may not mr pelham go to a masquerade as well as his betters my voice and words undeceived my cerberus and i was admitted i hastened to bed and no sooner had i laid my head on my pillow than i fell fast asleep it must be confessed that i had deserved tired natures sweet restorer i had not been above a couple of hours in the land of dreams when i was awakened by some one grasping my arm the events of the past night were so fresh in my memory that i sprung up as if the knife was at my throatmy eyes opened upon the peaceful countenance of mr job jonson thank heaven sir you are safe i had but a very faint hope of finding you here when i came why said i rubbing my eyes it is very true that i am safe honest job but i believe i have few thanks to give you for a circumstance so peculiarly agreeable to myself it would have saved me much trouble and your worthy friend mr fib fakescrew some pain if you had left the door open instead of shutting me up with your club as you are pleased to call it very true sir said job and i am extremely sorry at the accident it was dawson who shut the door through utter unconsciousness though i told him especially not to do itthe poor dog did not know whether he was on his head or his heels you have got him safe said i quickly aye trust me for that your honour i have locked him up at home while i came here to look for you we will lose no time in transferring him to safer custody said i leaping out of bed but be off tostreet directly slow and sure sir answered jonson it is for you to do whatever you please but my part of the business is over i shall sleep at dover tonight and breakfast at calais tomorrow perhaps it will not be very inconvenient to your honour to furnish me with my first quarters annuity in advance and to see that the rest is duly paid into lafittes at paris for the use of captain douglas where i shall live hereafter is at present uncertain but i dare say there will be few corners except old england and new england in which i shall not make merry on your honours bounty pooh my good fellow rejoined i never desert a country to which your talents do such credit stay here and reform on your annuity if ever i can accomplish my own wishes i will consult yours still farther for i shall always think of your services with gratitude though you did shut the door in my face no sir replied joblife is a blessing i would fain enjoy a few years longer and at present my sojourn in england would put it woefully in danger of club law besides i begin to think that a good character is a very agreeable thing when not too troublesome and as i have none left in england i may as well make the experiment abroad if your honour will call at the magistrates and take a warrant and an officer for the purpose of ridding me of my charge at the very instant i see my responsibility at an end i will have the honour of bidding you adieu well as you please said i curse your scoundrels cosmetics how the deuce am i ever to regain my natural complexion look ye sirrah you have painted me with a long wrinkle on the left side of my mouth big enough to engulph all the beauty i ever had why water seems to have no effect upon it to be sure not sir said job calmlyi should be but a poor dauber if my paints washed off with a wet sponge grant me patience cried i in a real panic how in the name of heaven are they to wash off am i before i have reached my twentythird year to look like a methodist parson on the wrong side of forty you rascal the latter question your honour can best answer returned job with regard to the former i have an unguent here if you will suffer me to apply it which will remove all other colours than those which nature has bestowed upon you with that job produced a small box and after a brief submission to his skill i had the ineffable joy of beholding myself restored to my original state nevertheless my delight was somewhat checked by the loss of my ringlets i thanked heaven however that the damage had been sustained after ellens acceptation of my addresses a lover confined to one should not be too destructive for fear of the consequences to the remainder of the female world compassion is ever due to the fair sex my toilet being concluded jonson and </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> and i repaired to the magistrates he waited at the corner of the street while i entered the house twere vain to tell what shook the holy man who looked not lovingly at that divan having summoned to my aid the redoubted mr of mulberrycheeked recollection we entered a hackneycoach and drove to jonsons lodgings job mounting guard on the box i think sir said mr looking up at the man of two virtues that i have had the pleasure of seeing that gentleman before very likely said i he is a young man greatly about town when we had safely lodged dawson who seemed more collected and even courageous than i had expected in the coach job beckoned me into a little parlour i signed him a draught on my bankers for one hundred poundsthough at that time it was like letting the last drop from my veinsand faithfully promised should dawsons evidence procure the desired end of which indeed there was now no doubt that the annuity should be regularly paid as he desired we then took an affectionate farewell of each other adieu sir said job i depart into a new worldthat of honest men if so said i adieu indeedfor on this earth we shall never meet again we returned tostreet as i was descending from the coach a female wrapped from head to foot in a cloak came eagerly up to me and seized me by the arm for gods sake said she in a low hurried voice come aside and speak to me for a single moment consigning dawson to the sole charge of the officer i did as i was desired when we had got some paces down the street the female stopped though she held her veil closely drawn over her face her voice and air were not to be mistaken i knew her at once glanville said she with great agitation sir reginald glanville tell me is he in real danger she stopped shortshe could say no more i trust not said i appearing not to recognize the speaker i trust not she repeated is that all and then the passionate feelings of her sex overcoming every other consideration she seized me by the hand and saidoh mr pelham for mercys sake tell me is he in the power of that villain thornton you need disguise nothing from me i know all the fatal history compose yourself dear dear lady roseville said i soothingly for it is in vain any longer to affect not to know you glanville is safe i have brought with me a witness whose testimony must release him god bless you god bless you said lady roseville and she burst into tears but she dried them directly and recovering some portion of that dignity which never long forsakes a woman of virtuous and educated mind she resumed proudly yet bitterlyit is no ordinary motive no motive which you might reasonably impute to me that has brought me here sir reginald glanville can never be any thing more to me than a friendbut of all friends the most known and valued i learned from his servant of his disappearance and my acquaintance with his secret history enabled me to account for it in the most fearful manner in short iibut explanations are idle now you will never say that you have seen me here mr pelham you will endeavour even to forget itfarewell lady roseville then drawing her cloak closely round her left me with a fleet and light step and turning the corner of the street disappeared i returned to my charge i demanded an immediate interview with the magistrate i have come said i to redeem my pledge and acquit the innocent i then briefly related my adventures only concealing according to my promise all description of my helpmate job and prepared the worthy magistrate for the confession and testimony of dawson that unhappy man had just concluded his narration when an officer entered and whispered the magistrate that thornton was in waiting admit him said mr aloud thornton entered with his usual easy and swaggering air of effrontery but no sooner did he set his eyes upon dawson than a deadly and withering change passed over his countenance dawson could not bridle the cowardly petulance of his spitethey know all thornton said he with a look of triumph the villain turned slowly from him to us muttering something we could not hear he saw upon my face upon the magistrates that his doom was sealed his desperation gave him presence of mind and he made a sudden rush to the door the officers in waiting seized him why should i detail the rest of the scene he was that day fully committed for trial and sir reginald glanville honourably released and unhesitatingly acquitted </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxv the main interest of my adventuresif indeed i may flatter myself that they ever contained anyis now over the mystery is explained the innocent acquitted and the guilty condemned moreover all obstacles between the marriage of the unworthy hero with the peerless heroine being removed it would be but an idle prolixity to linger over the preliminary details of an orthodox and customary courtship nor is it for me to dilate upon the exaggerated expressions of gratitude in which the affectionate heart of glanville found vent for my fortunate exertions on his behalf he was not willing that any praise to which i might be entitled for them should be lost he narrated to lady glanville and ellen my adventures with the comrades of the worthy job from the lips of the mother and the eyes of the dear sister came my sweetest addition to the good fortune which had made me the instrument of glanvilles safety and acquittal i was not condemned to a long protraction of that time which if it be justly termed the happiest of our lives we viz all true lovers through that perversity common to human nature most ardently wish to terminate on that day month which saw glanvilles release my bridals were appointed reginald was even more eager than myself in pressing for an early day firmly persuaded that his end was rapidly approaching his most prevailing desire was to witness our union this wish and the interest he took in our happiness gave him an energy and animation which impressed us with the deepest hopes for his ultimate recovery and the fatal disease to which he was a prey nursed the fondness of our hearts by the bloom of cheek and brightness of eye with which it veiled its desolating and gathering progress from the eventful day on which i had seen lady roseville instreet we had not met she had shut herself up in her splendid home and the newspapers teemed with regret at the reported illness and certain seclusion of one whose fetes and gaieties had furnished them with their brightest pages the only one admitted to her was ellen to her she had for some time made no secret of her attachmentand of her the daily news of sir reginalds health was ascertained several times when at a late hour i left glanvilles apartments i passed the figure of a woman closely muffled and apparently watching before his windowswhich owing to the advance of summer were never closedto catch perhaps a view of his room or a passing glimpse of his emaciated and fading figure if that sad and lonely vigil was kept by her whom i suspected deep indeed and mighty was the love which could so humble the heart and possess the spirit of the haughty and highborn countess of roseville i turn to a very different personage in this veritable histoire my father and mother were absent at lady hs when my marriage was fixed to both of them i wrote for their approbation of my choice from lady frances i received the answer which i subjoin my dearest son your father desires me to add his congratulations to mine upon the election you have made i shall hasten to london to be present at the ceremony although you must not be offended with me if i say that with your person accomplishments birth and above all high ton you might have chosen among the loftiest and wealthiest families in the country yet i am by no means displeased or disappointed with your future wife to say nothing of the antiquity of her name the glanvilles intermarried with the pelhams in the reign of henry ii it is a great step to future distinction to marry a beauty especially one so celebrated as miss glanvilleperhaps it is among the surest ways to the cabinet the forty thousand pounds which you say miss glanville is to receive makes to be sure but a slender income though when added to your own it would have been a great addition to the glenmorris property if your unclei have no patience with himhad not married again however you will lose no time in getting into the houseat all events the capital will ensure your return for a borough and maintain you comfortably till you are in the administration when of course it matters very little what your fortune may betradesmen will be too happy to have your name in their books be sure therefore that the money is not tied up miss glanville must see that her own interest as well as yours is concerned in your having the unfettered disposal of a fortune which if restricted you would find it impossible to live upon pray how is sir reginald glanville is his cough as bad as ever he has no entailed property i think will you order stonor to have the house ready for us on friday when i shall return home in time for dinner let me again congratulate you most sincerely on your choice i always thought you had more common sense as well as genius than any young man i ever knew you have shown it in this important step domestic happiness my dearest henry ought to be peculiarly sought for by every englishman however elevated his station and when i reflect upon miss glanvilles qualifications and her renommee as a belle celebree i have no doubt of your possessing the </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> the felicity you deserve but be sure that the fortune is not settled away from you poor sir reginald is not i believe at all covetous or worldly and will not therefore insist upon the point god bless you and grant you every happiness ever my dear henry your very affectionate mother f pelham ps i think it will be better to give out that miss glanville has eighty thousand pounds be sure therefore that you do not contradict me the days the weeks flew away ah happy days yet i do not regret while i recal you he that loves much fears even in his best founded hopes what were the anxious longings for a treasurein my view only not in my possessionto the deep joy of finding it for ever my own the day arrivedi was yet at my toilet and bedos in the greatest confusion poor fellow he was as happy as myself when a letter was brought me stamped with the foreign postmark it was from the exemplary job jonson and though i did not even open it on that day yet it shall be more favoured by the readerviz if he will not pass over without reading the following effusion rue des moulins no paris honoured sir i arrived in paris safely and reading in the english papers the full success of our enterprise as well as in the morning post of theth your approaching marriage with miss glanville i cannot refrain from the liberty of congratulating you upon both as well as of reminding you of the exact day on which the first quarter of my annuity will be paidit is theof for i presume your honour kindly made me a present of the draft for one hundred pounds in order to pay my travelling expenses i find that the boys are greatly incensed against me but as dawson was too much bound by his oath to betray a tittle against them i trust i shall ultimately pacify the club and return to england a true patriot sir never loves to leave his native country even were i compelled to visit van diemens land the ties of birthplace would be so strong as to induce me to seize the first opportunity of returning i am not your honour very fond of the frenchthey are an idle frivolous penurious poor nation only think sir the other day i saw a gentleman of the most noble air secrete something at a cafe which could not clearly discern as he wrapped it carefully in paper before he placed it in his pocket i judged that it was a silver cream ewer at least accordingly i followed him out and from pure curiosityi do assure your honour it was from no other motivei transferred this purloined treasure to my own pocket you will imagine sir the interest with which i hastened to a lonely spot in the tuileries and carefully taking out the little packet unfolded paper by paper till i cameyes sir till i came tofive lumps of sugar oh the french are a mean peoplea very mean peoplei hope i shall soon be able to return to england meanwhile i am going into holland to see how those rich burghers spend their time and their money i suppose poor dawson as well as the rascal thornton will be hung before you receive thisthey deserve it richlyit is such fellows who disgrace the profession he is but a very poor bungler who is forced to cut throats as well as pockets and now your honour wishing you all happiness with your lady i beg to remain your very obedient humble servant ferdinand de courcy etc struck with the joyous countenance of my honest valet as i took my gloves and hat from his hand i could not help wishing to bestow upon him a similar blessing to that i was about to possess bedos said i bedos my good fellow you left your wife to come to me you shall not suffer by your fidelity send for herwe will find room for her in our future establishment the smiling face of the frenchman underwent a rapid change ma foi said he in his own tongue monsieur is too good an excess of happiness hardens the heart and so for fear of forgetting my gratitude to providence i will with monsieurs permission suffer my adored wife to remain where she is after so pious a reply i should have been worse than wicked had i pressed the matter any farther i found all ready at berkeleysquare lady glanville is one of those good persons who think a marriage out of church is no marriage at all to church therefore we went although sir reginald was now so reduced that he could scarcely support the least fatigue he insisted on giving ellen away he was that morning and had been for the last two or three days considerably better and our happiness seemed to grow less selfish in our increasing hope of his recovery when we returned from church our intention was to set off immediately tohall a seat which i had hired for our reception on reentering the house glanville called me asidei followed his infirm and tremulous steps into a private apartment pelham said he we shall never meet again no matteryou are now happy and i shall shortly be so but there is one office i have yet to request from your friendship when i am dead let me be buried by her side and let one tombstone cover both i pressed his hand and with tears in my eyes made him the promise he required it is enough said he i have no farther business with life god bless you my friendmy brother do not let a thought of me cloud your happiness he rose and we turned to quit the room glanville was leaning on my arm when we had moved a few paces towards the door he stopped abruptly imagining that the pause proceeded from pain or debility i turned my eyes upon his countenancea fearful and convulsive change was rapidly passing over ithis eyes stared wildly upon vacancy merciful godis itcan it be he said in a low inward tone at that moment i solemnly declare whether from my sympathy with his feelings or from some more mysterious and undefinable cause my whole frame shuddered from limb to limb i saw nothingi heard nothing but i felt as it were within me some awful and ghostly presence which had power to curdle my blood into ice and cramp my sinews into impotence it was as if some preternatural and shadowy object darkened across the mirror of my soulas if without the medium of the corporeal senses a spirit spake to and was answered by a spirit the moment was over i felt glanvilles hand relax its grasp upon my armhe fell upon the floori raised hima smile of ineffable serenity and peace was upon his lips his face was as the face of an angel but the spirit had passed away </chapter>

<chapter>chapter lxxxvi now haveth good day good men all haveth good day young and old haveth good day both great and small and graunt merci a thousand fold gif ever i might full fain i wold don ought that were unto your leve christ keep you out of cares cold for now tis time to take my leave old song several months have now elapsed since my marriage i am living quietly in the country among my books and looking forward with calmness rather than impatience to the time which shall again bring me before the world marriage with me is not that sepulchre of all human hope and energy which it often is with others i am not more partial to my arm chair nor more averse to shaving than of yore i do not bound my prospects to the dinnerhour nor my projects to migrations from the blue bed to the brown matrimony found me ambitious it has not cured me of the passion but it has concentrated what was scattered and determined what was vague if i am less anxious than formerly for the reputation to be acquired in society i am more eager for honour in the world and instead of amusing my enemies and the saloon i trust yet to be useful to my friends and to mankind whether this is a hope altogether vain and idle whether i have in the selfconceit common to all men peculiarly prominent in myself overrated both the power and the integrity of my mind for the one is bootless without the other neither i nor the world can yet tell time says one of the fathers is the only touchstone which distinguishes the prophet from the boaster meanwhile gentle reader during the two years which i purpose devoting to solitude and study i shall not be so occupied with my fields and folios as to render me uncourteous to thee if ever thou hast known me in the city i give thee a hearty invitation to come and visit me in the country i promise thee that my wines and viands shall not disgrace the companion of guloseton nor my conversation be much duller than my book i will compliment thee on thy horses thou shalt congratulate me upon my wife over old wine we will talk over new events and if we flag at the latter why we will make ourselves amends with the former in short if thou art neither very silly nor very wise it shall be thine own fault if we are not excellent friends i feel that it would be but poor courtesy in me after having kept company with lord vincent through the tedious journey of three volumes to dismiss him now without one word of valediction may he in the political course he has adopted find all the admiration his talents deserve and if ever we meet as foes let our heaviest weapon be a quotation and our bitterest vengeance a jest lord guloseton regularly corresponds with me and his last letter contained a promise to visit me in the course of the month in order to recover his appetite which has been much relaxed of late </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> late by the country air my uncle wrote to me three weeks since announcing the death of the infant lady glenmorris had brought him sincerely do i wish that his loss may be supplied i have already sufficient fortune for my wants and sufficient hope for my desires thornton died as he had livedthe reprobate and the ruffian pooh said he in his quaint brutality to the worthy clergyman who attended his last moments with more zeal than success pooh whats the difference between gospel and gospell we agree like a bell and its clapperyoure prating while im hanging dawson died in prison penitent and in peace cowardice which spoils the honest man often ameliorates the knave from lord dawton i have received a letter requesting me to accept a borough in his gift just vacated it is a pity that generositysuch a prodigal to those who do not want itshould often be such a niggard to those who do i need not specify my answer one may as well be free as dependant when one can afford it and i hope yet to teach lord dawton that to forgive the minister is not to forget the affront meanwhile i am content to bury myself in my retreat with my mute teachers of logic and legislature in order hereafter to justify his lordships good opinion of my senatorial abilities farewell brutus we shall meet at philippi it is some months since lady roseville left england the last news we received of her informed us that she was living at sienna in utter seclusion and very infirm health the day drags thro though storms keep out the sun and thus the heart will break yet brokenly live on poor lady glanville the mother of one so beautiful so gifted and so lost what can i say of her which you and you and you all who are parents cannot feel a thousand times more acutely in those recesses of the heart too deep for words or tears there are yet many hours in which i find the sister of the departed in grief that even her husband cannot console and iimy friend my brother have i forgotten thee in death i lay down the pen i turn from my employmentthy dog is at my feet and looking at me as if conscious of my thoughts with an eye almost as tearful as my own but it is not thus that i will part from my reader our greeting was not in sorrow neither shall be our adieus for thee who hast gone with me through the motley course of my confessions i would fain trust that i have sometimes hinted at thy instruction when only appearing to strive for thy amusement but on this i will not dwell for the moral insisted upon often loses its effect and all that i will venture to hope is that i have opened to thee one true and not utterly hacknied page in the various and mighty volume of mankind in this busy and restless world i have not been a vague speculator nor an idle actor while all around me were vigilant i have not laid me down to sleepeven for the luxury of a poets dream like the school boy i have considered study as study but action as delight nevertheless whatever i have seen or heard or felt has been treasured in my memory and brooded over by my thoughts i now place the result before you sicut meus est mos nescio quid meditans nugarum but not perhapstotus in illis whatever societywhether in a higher or lower gradei have portrayed my sketches have been taken rather as a witness than a copyist for i have never shunned that circle nor that individual which presented life in a fresh view or man in a new relation it is right however that i should add that as i have not wished to be an individual satirist rather than a general observer i have occasionally in the subordinate characters such as russelton and gordon taken only the outline from truth and filled up the colours at my leisure and my will with regard to myself i have been more candid i have not only shewnnon parca manumy faults but grant that this is a much rarer exposure my foibles and in my anxiety for your entertainment i have not grudged you the pleasure of a laugheven at my own expense forgive me then if i am not a fashionable heroforgive me if i have not wept over a blighted spirit nor boasted of a british heart and allow that a man who in these days of alternate werters and worthies is neither the one nor the other is at least a novelty in print though i fear common enough in life and now my kind reader having remembered the proverb and in saying one word to thee having said two for myself i will no longer detain thee whatever thou mayest think of me and my thousand faults both as an author and a man believe me it is with a sincere and affectionate wish for the accomplishment of my parting words that i bid theefarewell
