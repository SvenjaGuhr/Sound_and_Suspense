 <lowSuspense1> i took the house of brentwood on my return from india in 18 for the temporary accommodation of my family until i could find a permanent home for them it had many advantages which made it peculiarly appropriate it was within reach of edinburgh and my boy roland whose education had been considerably neglected could go in and out to school which was thought to be better for him than either leaving home altogether or staying there always with a tutor the first of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of these expedients would have seemed preferable to me the second commended itself to his mother the doctor like a judicious man took the midway between put him on his pony and let him rile into the high school every morning it will do him all the good in the world dr simson said and when it is bad weather there is the train his mother accepted this solution of the difficulty more easily than i could have hoped and our palefaced boy who had never known anything more invigorating than simla began to encounter the brisk breezes of the north in the subdued severity of the month of may before the time of the vacation in july we had the satisfaction of seeing him begin to acquire something of the brown and ruddy complexion of his schoolfellows the english system did not commend itself to scotland in these days there was no little eton at fettes nor do i think if there had been that a genteel exotic of that class would have tempted either my wife or me the lad was doubly </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> doubly precious to us being the only one left us of many and he was fragile in body we believed and deeply sensitive in mind to keep him at home and yet to send him to schoolto combine the advantages of the two systemsseemed to be everything that could be desired the two girls also found at brentwood everything they wanted they were near enough to edinburgh to have masters and lessons as many as they required for completing that neverending education which the young people seem to require nowadays their mother married me when she was younger than agatha and i should like to see them improve upon their mother i myself was then no more than twentyfivean age at which i see the young fellows now groping about them with no notion what they are going to do with their lives however i suppose every generation has a conceit of itself which elevates it in its own opinion above that which comes after it brentwood stands on that fine and wealthy slope of countryone of the richest in scotlandwhich lies between the </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> the pentland hills and the firth in clear weather you could see the blue gleamlike a bent bow embracing the wealthy fields and scattered housesof the great estuary on one side of you and on the other the blue heights not gigantic like those we had been used to but just high enough for all the glories of the atmosphere the play of clouds and sweet reflections which give to a hilly country an interest and a charm which nothing else can emulate edinburghwith its two lesser heights the castle and the calton hill its spires and towers piercing through the smoke and arthurs seat lying crouched behind like a guardian no longer very needful taking his repose beside the wellbeloved charge which is now so to speak able to take care of itself without himlay at our right hand from the lawn and drawingroom windows we could see all these varieties of landscape the color was sometimes a little chilly but sometimes also as animated and full of vicissitude as a drama i was never tired of it its color and freshness revived </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> revived the eyes which had grown weary of arid plains and blazing skies it was always cheery and fresh and full of repose the village of brentwood lay almost under the house on the other side of the deep little ravine down which a streamwhich ought to have been a lovely wild and frolicsome little riverflowed between its rocks and trees the river like so many in that district had however in its earlier life been sacrificed to trade and was grimy with papermaking but this did not affect our pleasure in it so much as i have known it to affect other streams perhaps our water was more rapid perhaps less clogged with dirt and refuse our side of the dell was charmingly accident and clothed with fine trees through which various paths wound down to the riverside and to the village bridge which crossed the stream the village lay in the hollow and climbed with very prosaic houses the other side village architecture does not flourish in scotland the blue slates and the gray stone are sworn foes to the picturesque and </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> and though i do not for my own part dislike the interior of an oldfashioned hewed and galleried church with its little family settlements on all sides the square box outside with its bit of a spire like a handle to lift it by is not an improvement to the landscape still a cluster of houses on differing elevations with scraps of garden coming in between a hedgerow with clothes laid out to dry the opening of a street with its rural sociability the women at their doors the slow wagon lumbering along gives a centre to the landscape it was cheerful to look at and convenient in a hundred ways within ourselves we had walks in plenty the glen being always beautiful in all its phases whether the woods were green in the spring or ruddy in the autumn in the park which surrounded the house were the ruins of the former mansion of brentwooda much smaller and less important house than the solid georgian edifice which we inhabited the ruins were picturesque however and gave importance to the place even we who </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> who were but temporary tenants felt a vague pride in them as if they somehow reflected a certain consequence upon ourselves the old building had the remains of a toweran indistinguishable mass of masonwork overgrown with ivy and the shells of walls attached to this were half filled up with soil i had never examined it closely i am ashamed to say there was a large room or what had been a large room with the lower part of the windows still existing on the principal floor and underneath other windows which were perfect though half filled up with fallen soil and waving with a wild growth of brambles and chance growths of all kinds this was the oldest part of all at a little distance were some very commonplace and disjointed fragments of building one of them suggesting a certain pathos by its very commonness and the complete wreck which it showed this was the end of a low gable a bit of gray wall all incrusted with lichens in which was a common doorway probably it had been a servants entrance a </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> a backdoor or opening into what are called the offices in scotland no offices remained to be enteredpantry and kitchen had all been swept out of being but there stood the doorway open and vacant free to all the winds to the rabbits and every wild creature it struck my eye the first time i went to brentwood like a melancholy comment upon a life that was over a door that led to nothingclosed once perhaps with anxious care bolted and guarded now void of any meaning it impressed me i remember from the first so perhaps it may be said that my mind was prepared to attach to it an importance which nothing justified the summer was a very happy period of repose for us all the warmth of indian suns was still in our veins it seemed to us that we could never have enough of the greenness the dewiness the freshness of the northern landscape even its mists were pleasant to us taking all the fever out of us and pouring in vigor and refreshment in autumn we followed the fashion </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> fashion of the time and went away for change which we did not in the least require it was when the family had settled down for the winter when the days were short and dark and the rigorous reign of frost upon us that the incidents occurred which alone could justify me in intruding upon the world my private affairs these incidents were however of so curious a character that i hope my inevitable references to my own family and pressing personal interests will meet with a general pardon i was absent in london when these events began in london an old indian plunges back into the interests with which all his previous life has been associated and meets old friends at every step i had been circulating among some halfdozen of theseenjoying the return to my former life in shadow though i had been so thankful in substance to throw it asideand had missed some of my home letters what with going down from friday to monday to old benbows place in the country and stopping on the way back to dine and </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> and sleep at sellars and to take a look into crosss stables which occupied another day it is never safe to miss ones letters in this transitory life as the prayerbook says how can one ever be certain what is going to happen all was well at home i knew exactly i thought what they would have to say to me the weather has been so fine that roland has not once gone by train and he enjoys the ride beyond anything dear papa be sure that you dont forget anything but bring us soandso and soandsoa list as long as my arm dear girls and dearer mother i would not for the world have forgotten their commissions or lost their little letters for all the benbows and crosses in the world but i was confident in my homecomfort and peacefulness when i got back to my club however three or four letters were lying for one upon some of which i noticed the immediate urgent which oldfashioned people and anxious people still believe will influence the postoffice and quicken the speed of the </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> the mails i was about to open one of these when the club porter brought me two telegrams one of which he said had arrived the night before i opened as was to be expected the last first and this was what i read why dont you come or answer for gods sake come he is much worse this was a thunderbolt to fall upon a mans head who had one only son and lie the light of his eyes the other telegram which i opened with hands trembling so much that i lost time by my haste was to much the same purport no better doctor afraid of brainfever calls for you day and night let nothing detain you the first thing i did was to look up the timetables to see if there was any way of getting off sooner than by the nighttrain though i knew well enough there was not and then i read the letters which furnished alas too clearly all the details they told me that the boy had been pale for some time with a scared look </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> look his mother had noticed it before i left home but would not say anything to alarm me this look had increased day by day and soon it was observed that roland came home at a wild gallop through the park his pony panting and in foam himself as white as a sheet but with the perspiration streaming from his forehead for a long time he had resisted all questioning but at length had developed such strange changes of mood showing a reluctance to go to school a desire to be fetched in the carriage at nightwhich was a ridiculous piece of luxuryan unwillingness to go out into the grounds and nervous start at every sound that his mother had insisted upon an explanation when the boyour boy roland who had never known what fear wasbegan to talk to her of voices he had heard in the park and shadows that had appeared to him among the ruins my wife promptly put him to bed and sent for dr simson which of course was the only thing to do i hurried off that evening </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> evening as may be supposed with an anxious heart how i got through the hours before the starting of the train i cannot tell we must all be thankful for the quickness of the railway when in anxiety but to have thrown myself into a postchaise as soon as horses could be put to would have been a relief i got to edinburgh very early in the blackness of the winter morning and scarcely dared look the man in the face at whom i gasped what news my wife had sent the brougham for me which i concluded before the man spoke was a bad sign his answer was that stereotyped answer which leaves the imagination so wildly freejust the same just the same what might that mean the horses seemed to me to creep along the long dark country road as we dashed through the park i thought i heard some one moaning among the trees and clenched my fist at him whoever he might be with fury why had the fool of a woman at the gate allowed any one to come </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> come in to disturb the quiet of the place if i had not been in such hot haste to get home i think i should have stopped the carriage and got out to see what tramp it was that had made an entrance and chosen my grounds of all places in the worldwhen my boy was illto grumble and groan in but i had no reason to complain of our slow pace here the horses flew like lightning along the intervening path and drew up at the door all panting as if they had run a race my wife stood waiting to receive me with a pale face and a candle in her hand which made her look paler still as the wind blew the flame about he is sleeping she said in a whisper as if her voice might wake him and i replied when i could find my voice also in a whisper as though the jingling of the horses furniture and the sound of their hoofs must not have been more dangerous i stood on the steps with her a moment </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> moment almost afraid to go in now that i was here and it seemed to me that i saw without observing if i may say so that the horses were unwilling to turn round though their stables lay that way or that the men were unwilling these things occurred to me afterwards though at the moment i was not capable of anything but to ask questions and to hear of the condition of the boy i looked at him from the door of his room for we were afraid to go near lest we should disturb that blessed sleep it looked like actual sleep not the lethargy into which my wife told me he would sometimes fall she told me everything in the next room which communicated with his rising now and then and going to the door of communication and in this there was much that was very startling and confusing to the mind it appeared that ever since the winter begansince it was early dark and night had fallen before his return from schoolhe had been hearing voices among the ruins at </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> at first only a groaning he said at which his pony was as much alarmed as he was but by degrees a voice the tears ran down my wifes cheeks as she described to me how he would start up in the night and cry out oh mother let me in oh mother let me in with a pathos which rent her heart and she sitting there all the time only longing to do everything his heart could desire but though she would try to soothe him crying you are at home my darling i am here dont you know me your mother is here he would only stare at her and after a while spring up again with the same cry at other times he would be quite reasonable she said asking eagerly when i was coming but declaring that he must go with me as soon as i did so to let them in the doctor thinks his nervous system must have received a shock my wife said oh henry can it be that we have pushed him on too much with </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> with his worka delicate boy like roland and what is his work in comparison with his health even you would think little of honors or prizes if it hurt the boys health even ias if i were an inhuman father sacrificing my child to my ambition but i would not increase her trouble by taking any notice after awhile they persuaded me to lie down to rest and to eat none of which things had been possible since i received their letters the mere fact of being on the spot of course in itself was a great thing and when i knew that i could be called in a moment as soon as he was awake and wanted me i felt capable even in the dark chill morning twilight to snatch an hour or twos sleep as it happened i was so worn out with the strain of anxiety and he so quieted and consoled by knowing i had come that i was not disturbed till the afternoon when the twilight had again settled down there was just daylight enough to see his face </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> face when i went to him and what a change in a fortnight he was paler and more worn i thought than even in those dreadful days in the plains before we left india his hair seemed to me to have grown long and lank his eyes were like blazing lights projecting out of his white face he got hold of my hand in a cold and tremulous clutch and waved to everybody to go away go awayeven mother he said go away this went to her heart for she did not like that even i should have more of the boys confidence than herself but my wife has never been a woman to think of herself and she left us alone are they all gone he said eagerly they would not let me speak the doctor treated me as if i were a fool you know i am not a fool papa yes yes my boy i know but you are ill and quiet is so necessary you are not only not a fool roland but you are reasonable and understand when you </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> you are ill you must deny yourself you must not do everything that you might do being well he waved his thin hand with a sort of indignation then father i am not ill he cried oh i thought when you came you would not stop meyou would see the sense of it what do you think is the matter with me all of you simson is well enough but he is only a doctor what do you think is the matter with me i am no more ill than you are a doctor of course he thinks you are ill the moment he looks at youthats what hes there forand claps you into bed which is the best place for you at present my dear boy i made up my mind cried the little fellow that i would stand it till you came home i said to myself i wont frighten mother and the girls but now father he cried half jumping out of bed its not illness its a secret his eyes shone so wildly his face was so swept with strong </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> strong feeling that my heart sank within me it could be nothing but fever that did it and fever had been so fatal i got him into my arms to put him back into bed roland i said humoring the poor child which i knew was the only way if you are going to tell me this secret to do any good you know you must be quite quiet and not excite yourself if you excite yourself i must not let you speak yes father said the boy he was quiet directly like a man as if he quite understood when i had laid him back on his pillow he looked up at me with that grateful sweet look with which children when they are ill break ones heart the water coming into his eyes in his weakness i was sure as soon as you were here you would know what to do he said to be sure my boy now keep quiet and tell it all out like a man to think i was telling lies to my own child for i did </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> did it only to humor him thinking poor little fellow his brain was wrong yes father father there is some one in the parksome one that has been badly used hush my dear you remember there is to be no excitement well who is this somebody and who has been illusing him we will soon put a stop to that all cried roland but it is not so easy as you think i dont know who it is it is just a cry oh if you could hear it it gets into my head in my sleep i heard it as clearas clear and they think that i am dreaming or raving perhaps the boy said with a sort of disdainful smile this look of his perplexed me it was less like fever than i thought are you quite sure you have not dreamed it roland i said dreamedthat he was springing up again when he suddenly bethought himself and lay down flat with the same sort of smile on his face the pony heard it too he said she jumped as if she </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> she had been shot if i had not grasped at the reinsfor i was frightened father no shame to you my boy said i though i scarcely knew why if i hadnt held to her like a leech shed have pitched me over her head and never drew breath till we were at the door did the pony dream it he said with a soft disdain yet indulgence for my foolishness then he added slowly it was only a cry the first time and all the time before you went away i wouldnt tell you for it was so wretched to be frightened i thought it might be a hare or a rabbit snared and i went in the morning and looked but there was nothing it was after you went i heard it really first and this is what he says he raised himself on his elbow close to me and looked me in the face oh mother let me in oh mother let me in as he said the words a mist came over his face the mouth quivered the soft features </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> features all melted and changed and when he had ended these pitiful words dissolved in a shower of heavy tears was it a hallucination was it the fever of the brain was it the disordered fancy caused by great bodily weakness how could i tell i thought it wisest to accept it as if it were all true this is very touching roland i said oh if you had just heard it father i said to myself if father heard it he would do something but mamma you know shes given over to simson and that fellows a doctor and never thinks of anything but clapping you into bed we must not blame simson for being a doctor roland no no said my boy with delightful toleration and indulgence oh no thats the good of him thats what hes for i know that but youyou are different you are just father and youll do somethingdirectly papa directly this very night surely i said no doubt it is some little lost child he gave me a sudden swift look investigating my face as though to </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> to see whether after all this was everything my eminence as father came tono more than that then he got hold of my shoulder clutching it with his thin hand look here he said with a quiver in his voice suppose it wasntliving at all my dear boy how then could you have heard it i said he turned away from me with a pettish exclamationas if you didnt know better than that do you want to tell me it is a ghost i said roland withdrew his hand his countenance assumed an aspect of great dignity and gravity a slight quiver remained about his lips whatever it wasyou always said we were not to call names it was somethingin trouble oh father in terrible trouble but my boy i said i was at my wits end if it was a child that was lost or any poor human creaturebut roland what do you want me to do i should know if i was you said the child eagerly that is what i always said to myselffather will know oh papa papa to have </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> have to face it night after night in such terrible terrible trouble and never to be able to do it any good i dont want to cry its like a baby i know but what can i do else out there all by itself in the ruin and nobody to help it i cant bear it i cant bear it cried my generous boy and in his weakness he burst out after many attempts to restrain it into a great childish fit of sobbing and tears i do not know that i ever was in a greater perplexity in my life and afterwards when i thought of it there was something comic in it too it is bad enough to find your childs mind possessed with the conviction that he has seen or heard a ghost but that he should require you to go instantly and help that ghost was the most bewildering experience that had ever come my way i am a sober man myself and not superstitiousat least any more than everybody is superstitious of course i do not believe in ghosts </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> ghosts but i dont deny any more than other people that there are stories which i cannot pretend to understand my blood got a sort of chill in my veins at the idea that roland should be a ghostseer for that generally means a hysterical temperament and weak health and all that men most hate and fear for their children but that i should take up his ghost and right its wrongs and save it from its trouble was such a mission as was enough to confuse any man i did my best to console my boy without giving any promise of this astonishing kind but he was too sharp for me he would have none of my caresses with sobs breaking in at intervals upon his voice and the raindrops hanging on his eyelids he yet returned to the charge it will be there nowit will be there all the night oh think papathink if it was me i cant rest for thinking of it dont he cried putting away my handdont you go and help it and mother can take care of </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> of me but roland what can i do my boy opened his eyes which were large with weakness and fever and gave me a smile such i think as sick children only know the secret of i was sure you would know as soon as you came i always said father will know and mother he cried with a softening of repose upon his face his limbs relaxing his form sinking with a luxurious ease in his bedmother can come and take care of me i called her and saw him turn to her with the complete dependence of a child and then i went away and left them as perplexed a man as any in scotland i must say however i had this consolation that my mind was greatly eased about roland he might be under a hallucination but his head was clear enough and i did not think him so ill as everybody else did the girls were astonished even at the ease with which i took it how do you think he is they said in a breath coming round me </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> me laying hold of me not half so ill as i expected i said not very bad at all oh papa you are a darling cried agatha kissing me and crying upon my shoulder while little jeanie who was as pale as roland clasped both her arms round mine and could not speak at all i knew nothing about it not half so much as simson but they believed in me they had a feeling that all would go right now god is very good to you when your children look to you like that it makes one humble not proud i was not worthy of it and then i recollected that i had to act the part of a father to rolands ghostwhich made me almost laugh though i might just as well have cried it was the strangest mission that ever was intrusted to mortal man it was then i remembered suddenly the looks of the men when they turned to take the brougham to the stables in the dark that morning they had not liked it and the horses had not </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> not liked it i remembered that even in my anxiety about roland i had heard them tearing along the avenue back to the stables and had made a memorandum mentally that i must speak of it it seemed to me that the best thing i could do was to go to the stables now and make a few inquiries it is impossible to fathom the minds of rustics there might be some devilry of practical joking for anything i knew or they might have some interest in getting up a bad reputation for the brentwood avenue it was getting dark by the time i went out and nobody who knows the country will need to be told how black is the darkness of a november night under high laurelbushes and yewtrees i walked into the heart of the shrubberies two or three times not seeing a step before me till i came out upon the broader carriageroad where the trees opened a little and there was a faint gray glimmer of sky visible under which the great limes and elms stood darkling like ghosts </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> ghosts but it grew black again as i approached the corner where the ruins lay both eyes and ears were on the alert as may be supposed but i could see nothing in the absolute gloom and so far as i can recollect i heard nothing nevertheless there came a strong impression upon me that somebody was there it is a sensation which most people have felt i have seen when it has been strong enough to awake me out of sleep the sense of some one looking at me i suppose my imagination had been affected by rolands story and the mystery of the darkness is always full of suggestions i stamped my feet violently on the gravel to rouse myself and called out sharply whos there nobody answered nor did i expect any one to answer but the impression had been made i was so foolish that i did not like to look back but went sideways keeping an eye on the gloom behind it was with great relief that i spied the light in the stables making a sort of oasis </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> oasis in the darkness i walked very quickly into the midst of that lighted and cheerful place and thought the clank of the grooms pail one of the pleasantest sounds i had ever heard the coachman was the head of this little colony and it was to his house i went to pursue my investigations he was a native of the district and had taken care of the place in the absence of the family for years it was impossible but that he must know everything that was going on and all the traditions of the place the men i could see eyed me anxiously when i thus appeared at such an hour among them and followed me with their eyes to jarviss house where he lived alone with his old wife their children being all married and out in the world mrs jarvis met me with anxious questions how was the poor young gentleman but the others knew i could see by their faces that not even this was the foremost thing in my mind noisesou ay therell be noisesthe wind in the </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> the trees and the water soughing down the glen as for tramps cornel no theres little o that kind o cattle about here and merran at the gates a careful body jarvis moved about with some embarrassment from one leg to another as he spoke he kept in the shade and did not look at me more than he could help evidently his mind was perturbed and he had reasons for keeping his own counsel his wife sat by giving him a quick look now and then but saying nothing the kitchen was very snug and warm and brightas different as could be from the chill and mystery of the night outside i think you are trifling with me jarvis i said triflin cornel no me what would i trifle for if the deevil himsel was in the auld hoose i have no interest in t one way or another sandy hold your peace cried his wife imperatively and what am i to hold my peace for wi the cornel standing there asking a thae questions im saying if the deevil himsel and im </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> im telling ye hold your peace cried the woman in great excitement dark november weather and lang nichts and us that ken a we ken how daur ye namea name that shouldna be spoken she threw down her stocking and got up also in great agitation i tellt ye you never could keep it its no a thing that will hide and the haill toun kens as weel as you or me tell the cornel straight outor see ill do it i dinna hold wi your secrets and a secret that the haill toun kens she snapped her fingers with an air of large disdain as for jarvis ruddy and big as he was he shrank to nothing before this decided woman he repeated to her two or three times her own adjuration hold your peace then suddenly changing his tone cried out tell him then confound ye ill wash my hands ot if a the ghosts in scotland were in the auld hoose is that ony concern o mine after this i elicited without much difficulty the whole story in the opinion of </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> of the jarvises and of everybody about the certainty that the place was haunted was beyond all doubt as sandy and his wife warmed to the tale one tripping up another in their eagerness to tell everything it gradually developed as distinct a superstition as i ever heard and not without poetry and pathos how long it was since the voice had been heard first nobody could tell with certainty jarviss opinion was that his father who had been coachman at brentwood before him had never heard anything about it and that the whole thing had arisen within the last ten years since the complete dismantling of the old house which was a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticated according to these witnesses and to several whom i questioned afterwards and who were all in perfect agreement it was only in the months of november and december that the visitation occurred during these months the darkest of the year scarcely a night passed without the recurrence of these inexplicable cries nothing it was said had ever been seenat least nothing that </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> that could be identified some people bolder or more imaginative than the others had seen the darkness moving mrs jarvis said with unconscious poetry it began when night fell and continued at intervals till day broke very often it was only all inarticulate cry and moaning but sometimes the words which had taken possession of my poor boys fancy had been distinctly audibleoh mother let me in the jarvises were not aware that there had ever been any investigation into it the estate of brentwood had lapsed into the hands of a distant branch of the family who had lived but little there and of the many people who had taken it as i had done few had remained through two decembers and nobody had taken the trouble to make a very close examination into the facts no no jarvis said shaking his head no no cornel wha wad set themsels up for a laughinstock to a the countryside making a wark about a ghost naebody believes in ghosts it bid to be the wind in the trees the last gentleman said or some </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> some effec o the water wrastlin among the rocks he said it was a quite easy explained but he gave up the hoose and when you cam cornel we were awfu anxious you should never hear what for should i have spoiled the bargain and hairmed the property for nothing do you call my childs life nothing i said in the trouble of the moment unable to restrain myself and instead of telling this all to me you have told it to himto a delicate boy a child unable to sift evidence or judge for himself a tenderhearted young creature i was walking about the room with an anger all the hotter that i felt it to be most likely quite unjust my heart was full of bitterness against the stolid retainers of a family who were content to risk other peoples children and comfort rather than let a house be empty if i had been warned i might have taken precautions or left the place or sent roland away a hundred things which now i could not do and here i was with </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> with my boy in a brainfever and his life the most precious life on earth hanging in the balance dependent on whether or not i could get to the reason of a commonplace ghoststory i paced about in high wrath not seeing what i was to do for to take roland away even if he were able to travel would not settle his agitated mind and i feared even that a scientific explanation of refracted sound or reverberation or any other of the easy certainties with which we elder men are silenced would have very little effect upon the boy cornel said jarvis solemnly and shell bear me witnessthe young gentleman never heard a word from meno nor from either groom or gardener ill gie ye my word for that in the first place hes no a lad that invites ye to talk there are some that are and some that arena some will draw ye on till yeve tellt them a the clatter of the toun and a ye ken and whiles mair but maister roland his minds fu of his books hes </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> hes aye civil and kind and a fine lad but no that sort and ye see its for a our interest cornel that you should stay at brentwood i took it upon me mysel to pass the wordno a syllable to maister roland nor to the young leddiesno a syllable the womenservants that have little reason to be out at night ken little or nothing about it and some think it grand to have a ghost so long as theyre no in the way of coming across it if you had been tellt the story to begin with maybe ye would have thought so yourself this was true enough though it did not throw any light upon my perplexity if we had heard of it to start with it is possible that all the family would have considered the possession of a ghost a distinct advantage it is the fashion of the times we never think what a risk it is to play with young imaginations but cry out in the fashionable jargon a ghostnothing else was wanted to make it perfect i should </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> should not have been above this myself i should have smiled of course at the idea of the ghost at all but then to feel that it was mine would have pleased my vanity oh yes i claim no exemption the girls would have been delighted i could fancy their eagerness their interest and excitement no if we had been told it would have done no goodwe should have made the bargain all the more eagerly the fools that we are and there has been no attempt to investigate it i said to see what it really is eh cornel said the coachmans wife wha would investigate as ye call it a thing that nobody believes in ye would be the laughinstock of a the countryside as my man says but you believe in it i said turning upon her hastily the woman was taken by surprise she made a step backward out of my way lord cornel how ye frichten a body metheres awfu strange things in this world an unlearned person doesna ken what to think but the minister and the gentry </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> gentry they just laugh in your face inquire into the thing that is not na na we just let it be come with me jarvis i said hastily and well make an attempt at least say nothing to the men or to anybody ill come back after dinner and well make a serious attempt to see what it is if it is anything if i hear itwhich i doubtyou may be sure i shall never rest till i make it out be ready for me about ten oclock me cornel jarvis said in a faint voice i had not been looking at him in my own preoccupation but when i did so i found that the greatest change had come over the fat and ruddy coachman me cornel he repeated wiping the perspiration from his brow his ruddy face hung in flabby folds his knees knocked together his voice seemed half extinguished in his throat then he began to rub his hands and smile upon me in a deprecating imbecile way theres nothing i wouldna do to pleasure ye cornel taking a step further </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> further back im sure she kens ive aye said i never had to do with a mair fair weelspoken gentleman here jarvis came to a pause again looking at me rubbing his hands well i said but eh sir he went on with the same imbecile yet insinuating smile if yell reflect that i am no used to my feet with a horse atween my legs or the reins in my hand im maybe nae worse than other men but on fit cornelits no theboglesbut ive been cavalry ye see with a little hoarse laugh a my life to face a thing ye dinna understanon your feet cornel well sir if i do it said i tartly why shouldnt you eh cornel theres an awfu difference in the first place ye tramp about the haill countryside and think naething of it but a walk tires me mair than a hunard miles drive and then yere a gentleman and do your ain pleasure and youre no so auld as me and its for your ain bairn ye see cornel and then he believes in it </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> it cornel and you dinna believe in it the woman said will you come with me i said turning to her she jumped back upsetting her chair in her bewilderment me with a scream and then fell into a sort of hysterical laugh i wouldna say but what i would go but what would the folk say to hear of cornel mortimer with an auld silly woman at his heels the suggestion made me laugh too though i had little inclination for it im sorry you have so little spirit jarvis i said i must find some one else i suppose jarvis touched by this began to remonstrate but i cut him short my butler was a soldier who had been with me in india and was not supposed to fear anythingman or devilcertainly not the former and i felt that i was losing time the jarvises were too thankful to get rid of me they attended me to the door with the most anxious courtesies outside the two grooms stood close by a little confused by my sudden exit i dont know if </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> if perhaps they had been listeningas least standing as near as possible to catch any scrap of the conversation i waved my hand to them as i went past in answer to their salutations and it was very apparent to me that they also were glad to see me go and it will be thought very strange but it would be weak not to add that i myself though bent on the investigation i have spoken of pledged to roland to carry it out and feeling that my boys health perhaps his life depended on the result of my inquiryi felt the most unaccountable reluctance to pass these ruins on my way home my curiosity was intense and yet it was all my mind could do to pull my body along i daresay the scientific people would describe it the other way and attribute my cowardice to the state of my stomach i went on but if i had followed my impulse i should have turned and bolted everything in me seemed to cry out against it my heart thumped my pulses all began </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> began like sledgehammers beating against my ears and every sensitive part it was very dark as i have said the old house with its shapeless tower loomed a heavy mass through the darkness which was only not entirely so solid as itself on the other hand the great dark cedars of which we were so proud seemed to fill up the night my foot strayed out of the path in my confusion and the gloom together and i brought myself up with a cry as i felt myself knock against something solid what was it the contact with hard stone and lime and prickly bramblebushes restored me a little to myself oh its only the old gable i said aloud with a little laugh to reassure myself the rough feeling of the stones reconciled me as i groped about thus i shook off my visionary folly what so easily explained as that i should have strayed from the path in the darkness this brought me back to common existence as if i had been shaken by a wise hand out of all the silliness </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> silliness of superstition how silly it was after all what did it matter which path i took i laughed again this time with better heart when suddenly in a moment the blood was chilled in my veins a shiver stole along my spine my faculties seemed to forsake me close by me at my side at my feet there was a sigh no not a groan not a moaning not anything so tangiblea perfectly soft faint inarticulate sigh i sprang back and my heart stopped beating mistaken no mistake was impossible i heard it as clearly as i hear myself speak a long soft weary sigh as if drawn to the utmost and emptying out a load of sadness that filled the breast to hear this in the solitude in the dark in the night though it was still early had an effect which i cannot describe i feel it nowsomething cold creeping over me up into my hair and down to my feet which refused to move i cried out with a trembling voice who is there as i had done before but </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> but there was no reply i got home i dont quite know how but in my mind there was no longer any indifference as to the thing whatever it was that haunted these ruins my scepticism disappeared like a mist i was as firmly determined that there was something as roland was i did not for a moment pretend to myself that it was possible i could be deceived there were movements and noises which i understood all aboutcracklings of small branches in the frost and little rolls of gravel on the path such as have a very eerie sound sometimes and perplex you with wonder as to who has done it when there is no real mystery but i assure you all these little movements of nature dont affect you one bit when there is something i understood them i did not understand the sigh that was not simple nature there was meaning in it feeling the soul of a creature invisible this is the thing that human nature trembles ata creature invisible yet with sensations feelings a power somehow of expressing itself </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> itself i had not the same sense of unwillingness to turn my back upon the scene of the mystery which i had experienced in going to the stables but i almost ran home impelled by eagerness to get everything done that had to be done in order to apply myself to finding it out bagley was in the hall as usual when i went in he was always there in the afternoon always with the appearance of perfect occupation yet so far as i know never doing anything the door was open so that i hurried in without any pause breathless but the sight of his calm regard as he came to help me off with my overcoat subdued me in a moment anything out of the way anything incomprehensible faded to nothing in the presence of bagley you saw and wondered how he was made the parting of his hair the tie of his white neckcloth the fit of his trousers all perfect as works of art but you could see how they were done which makes all the difference i flung myself </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> myself upon him so to speak without waiting to note the extreme unlikeness of the man to anything of the kind i meant bagley i said i want you to come out with me tonight to watch for poachers colonel he said a gleam of pleasure running all over him no bagley a great deal worse i cried yes colonel at what hour sir the man said but then i had not told him what it was it was ten oclock when we set out all was perfectly quiet indoors my wife was with roland who had been quite calm she said and who though no doubt the fever must run its course had been better ever since i came i told bagley to put on a thick greatcoat over his evening coat and did the same myself with strong boots for the soil was like a sponge or worse talking to him i almost forgot what we were going to do it was darker even than it had been before and bagley kept very close to me as we went along i had </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> had a small lantern in my hand which gave us a partial guidance we had come to the corner where the path turns on one side was the bowlinggreen which the girls had taken possession of for their croquetgrounda wonderful enclosure surrounded by high hedges of holly three hundred years old and more on the other the ruins both were black as night but before we got so far there was a little opening in which we could just discern the trees and the lighter line of the road i thought it best to pause there and take breath bagley i said there is something about these ruins i dont understand it is there i am going keep your eyes open and your wits about you be ready to pounce upon any stranger you seeanything man or woman dont hurt but seize anything you see colonel said bagley with a little tremor in his breath they do say theres things thereas is neither man nor woman there was no time for words are you game to follow me my man thats the question i </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> i said bagley fell in without a word and saluted i knew then i had nothing to fear we went so far as i could guess exactly as i had come when i heard that sigh the darkness however was so complete that all marks as of trees or paths disappeared one moment we felt our feet on the gravel another sinking noiselessly into the slippery grass that was all i had shut up my lantern not wishing to scare any one whoever it might be bagley followed it seemed to me exactly in my footsteps as i made my way as i supposed towards the mass of the ruined house we seemed to take a long time groping along seeking this the squash of the wet soil under our feet was the only thing that marked our progress after a while i stood still to see or rather feel where we were the darkness was very still but no stiller than is usual in a winters night the sounds i have mentionedthe crackling of twigs the roll of a pebble the sound of </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> of some rustle in the dead leaves or creeping creature on the grasswere audible when you listened all mysterious enough when your mind is disengaged but to me cheering now as signs of the livingness of nature even in the death of the frost as we stood still there came up from the trees in the glen the prolonged hoot of an owl bagley started with alarm being in a state of general nervousness and not knowing what he was afraid of but to me the sound was encouraging and pleasant being so comprehensible an owl i said under my breath yes colonel said bagley his teeth chattering we stood still about five minutes while it broke into the still brooding of the air the sound widening out in circles dying upon the darkness this sound which is not a cheerful one made me almost gay it was natural and relieved the tension of the mind i moved on with new courage my nervous excitement calming down when all at once quite suddenly close to us at our feet there broke out a cry </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> cry i made a spring backwards in the first moment of surprise and horror and in doing so came sharply against the same rough masonry and brambles that had struck me before this new sound came upwards from the grounda low moaning wailing voice full of suffering and pain the contrast between it and the hoot of the owl was indescribablethe one with a wholesome wildness and naturalness that hurt nobody the other a sound that made ones blood curdle full of human misery with a great deal of fumblingfor in spite of everything i could do to keep up my courage my hands shooki managed to remove the slide of my lantern the light leaped out like something living and made the place visible in a moment we were what would have been inside the ruined building had anything remained but the gablewall which i have described it was close to us the vacant doorway in it going out straight into the blackness outside the light showed the bit of wall the ivy glistening upon it in clouds of dark green the bramblebranches </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> bramblebranches waving and below the open doora door that led to nothing it was from this the voice came which died out just as the light flashed upon this strange scene there was a moments silence and then it broke forth again the sound was so near so penetrating so pitiful that in the nervous start i gave the light fell out of my hand as i groped for it in the dark my hand was clutched by bagley who i think must have dropped upon his knees but i was too much perturbed myself to think much of this he clutched at me in the confusion of his terror forgetting all his usual decorum for gods sake what is it sir he gasped if i yielded there was evidently an end of both of us i cant tell i said any more than you thats what weve got to find out up man up i pulled him to his feet will you go round and examine the other side or will you stay here with the lantern bagley gasped at me with a </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> a face of horror cant we stay together colonel he said his knees were trembling under him i pushed him against the corner of the wall and put the light into his hands stand fast till i come back shake yourself together man let nothing pass you i said the voice was within two or three feet of us of that there could be no doubt i went myself to the other side of the wall keeping close to it the light shook in bagleys hand but tremulous though it was shone out through the vacant door one oblong block of light marking all the crumbling corners and hanging masses of foliage was that something dark huddled in a heap by the side of it i pushed forward across the light in the doorway and fell upon it with my hands but it was only a juniperbush growing close against the wall meanwhile the sight of my figure crossing the doorway had brought bagleys nervous excitement to a height he flew at me gripping my shoulder ive got him colonel ive got him he </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> he cried with a voice of sudden exultation he thought it was a man and was at once relieved but at that moment the voice burst forth again between us at our feetmore close to us than any separate being could be he dropped off from me and fell against the wall his jaw dropping as if he were dying i suppose at the same moment he saw that it was me whom he had clutched i for my part had scarcely more command of myself i snatched the light out of his hand and flashed it all about me wildly nothingthe juniperbush which i thought i had never seen before the heavy growth of the glistening ivy the brambles waving it was close to my ears now crying crying pleading as if for life either i heard the same words roland had heard or else in my excitement his imagination got possession of mine the voice went on growing into distinct articulation but wavering about now from one point now from another as if the owner of it were moving slowly back and </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> and forward mother mother and then an outburst of wailing as my mind steadied getting accustomed as ones mind gets accustomed to anything it seemed to me as if some uneasy miserable creature was pacing up and down before a closed door sometimesbut that must have been excitementi thought i heard a sound like knocking and then another burst oh mother mother all this close close to the space where i was standing with my lantern now before me now behind me a creature restless unhappy moaning crying before the vacant doorway which no one could either shut or open more do you hear it bagley do you hear what it is saying i cried stepping in through the doorway he was lying against the wall his eyes glazed half dead with terror he made a motion of his lips as if to answer me but no sounds came then lifted his hand with a curious imperative movement as if ordering me to be silent and listen and how long i did so i cannot tell it began to have an interest an exciting </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> exciting hold upon me which i could not describe it seemed to call up visibly a scene any one could understanda something shut out restlessly wandering to and fro sometimes the voice dropped as if throwing itself down sometimes wandered off a few paces growing sharp and clear oh mother let me in oh mother mother let me in oh let me in every word was clear to me no wonder the boy had gone wild with pity i tried to steady my mind upon roland upon his conviction that i could do something but my head swam with the excitement even when i partially overcame the terror at last the words died away and there was a sound of sobs and moaning i cried out in the name of god who are you with a kind of feeling in my mind that to use the name of god was profane seeing that i did not believe in ghosts or anything supernatural but i did it all the same and waited my heart giving a leap of terror lest there should be a reply </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> reply why this should have been i cannot tell but i had a feeling that if there was an answer it would be more than i could bear but there was no answer the moaning went on and then as if it had been real the voice rose a little higher again the words recommenced oh mother let me in oh mother let me in with an expression that was heartbreaking to hear as if it had been real what do i mean by that i suppose i got less alarmed as the thing went on i began to recover the use of my sensesi seemed to explain it all to myself by saying that this had once happened that it was a recollection of a real scene why there should have seemed something quite satisfactory and composing in this explanation i cannot tell but so it was i began to listen almost as if it had been a play forgetting bagley who i almost think had fainted leaning against the wall i was startled out of this strange spectatorship that had fallen upon </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> upon me by the sudden rush of something which made my heart jump once more a large black figure in the doorway waving its arms come in come in come in it shouted out hoarsely at the top of a deep bass voice and then poor bagley fell down senseless across the threshold he was less sophisticated than ihe had not been able to bear it any longer i took him for something supernatural as he took me and it was some time before i awoke to the necessities of the moment i remembered only after that from the time i began to give my attention to the man i heard the other voice no more it was some time before i brought him to it must have been a strange scene the lantern making a luminous spot in the darkness the mans white face lying on the black earth i over him doing what i could for him probably i should have been thought to be murdering him had any one seen us when at last i succeeded in pouring a little brandy </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> brandy down his throat he sat up and looked about him wildly whats up he said then recognizing me tried to struggle to his feet with a faint beg your pardon colonel i got him home as best i could making him lean upon my arm the great fellow was as weak as a child fortunately he did not for some time remember what had happened from the time bagley fell the voice had stopped and all was still youve got an epidemic in your house colonel simson said to me next morning whats the meaning of it all heres your butler raving about a voice this will never do you know and so far as i can make out you are in it too yes i am in it doctor i thought i had better speak to you of course you are treating roland all right but the boy is not raving he is as sane as you or me its all true as sane asior you i never thought the boy insane hes got cerebral excitement fever i dont know what youve </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> youve got theres something very queer about the look of your eyes come said i you cant put us all to bed you know you had better listen and hear the symptoms in full the doctor shrugged his shoulders but he listened to me patiently he did not believe a word of the story that was clear but he heard it all from beginning to end my dear fellow he said the boy told me just the same its an epidemic when one person falls a victim to this sort of thing its as safe as can betheres always two or three then how do you account for it i said oh account for itthats a different matter theres no accounting for the freaks our brains are subject to if its delusion if its some trick of the echoes or the windssome phonetic disturbance or other come with me tonight and judge for yourself i said upon this he laughed aloud then said thats not such a bad idea but it would ruin me forever if it were known that john simson was ghosthunting </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> ghosthunting there it is said i you dart down on us who are unlearned with your phonetic disturbances but you darent examine what the thing really is for fear of being laughed at thats science its not scienceits commonsense said the doctor the thing has delusion on the front of it it is encouraging an unwholesome tendency even to examine what good could come of it even if i am convinced i shouldnt believe i should have said so yesterday and i dont want you to be convinced or to believe said i if you prove it to be a delusion i shall be very much obliged to you for one come somebody must go with me you are cool said the doctor youve disabled this poor fellow of yours and made himon that pointa lunatic for life and now you want to disable me but for once ill do it to save appearance if youll give me a bed ill come over after my last rounds it was agreed that i should meet him at the gate and that we should visit the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> the scene of last nights occurrences before we came to the house so that nobody might be the wiser it was scarcely possible to hope that the cause of bagleys sudden illness should not somehow steal into the knowledge of the servants at least and it was better that all should be done as quietly as possible the day seemed to me a very long one i had to spend a certain part of it with roland which was a terrible ordeal for me for what could i say to the boy the improvement continued but he was still in a very precarious state and the trembling vehemence with which he turned to me when his mother left the room filled me with alarm father he said quietly yes my boy i am giving my best attention to it all is being done that i can do i have not come to any conclusionyet i am neglecting nothing you said i cried what i could not do was to give his active mind any encouragement to dwell upon the mystery it was a hard </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> hard predicament for some satisfaction had to be given him he looked at me very wistfully with the great blue eyes which shone so large and brilliant out of his white and worn face you must trust me i said yes father father understands he said to himself as if to soothe some inward doubt i left him as soon as i could he was about the most precious thing i had on earth and his health my first thought but yet somehow in the excitement of this other subject i put that aside and preferred not to dwell upon roland which was the most curious part of it all that night at eleven i met simson at the gate he had come by train and i let him in gently myself i had been so much absorbed in the coming experiment that i passed the ruins in going to meet him almost without thought if you can understand that i had my lantern and he showed me a coil of taper which he had ready for use there is nothing like light he </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> he said in his scoffing tone it was a very still night scarcely a sound but not so dark we could keep the path without difficulty as we went along as we approached the spot we could hear a low moaning broken occasionally by a bitter cry perhaps that is your voice said the doctor i thought it must be something of the kind thats a poor brute caught in some of these infernal traps of yours youll find it among the bushes somewhere i said nothing i felt no particular fear but a triumphant satisfaction in what was to follow i led him to the spot where bagley and i had stood on the previous night all was silent as a winter night could beso silent that we heard far off the sound of the horses in the stables the shutting of a window at the house simson lighted his taper and went peering about poking into all the corners we looked like two conspirators lying in wait for some unfortunate traveller but not a sound broke the quiet the moaning had stopped </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> stopped before we came up a star or two shone over us in the sky looking down as if surprised at our strange proceedings dr simson did nothing but utter subdued laughs under his breath i thought as much he said it is just the same with tables and all other kinds of ghostly apparatus a sceptics presence stops everything when i am present nothing ever comes off how long do you think it will be necessary to stay here oh i dont complain only when you are satisfied i amquite i will not deny that i was disappointed beyond measure by this result it made me look like a credulous fool it gave the doctor such a pull over me as nothing else could i should point all his morals for years to come and his materialism his scepticism would be increased beyond endurance it seems indeed i said that there is to be no manifestation he said laughing that is what all the mediums say no manifestations in consequence of the presence of an unbeliever his laugh sounded very uncomfortable to me </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> me in the silence and it was now near midnight but that laugh seemed the signal before it died away the moaning we had heard before was resumed it started from some distance off and came towards us nearer and nearer like some one walking along and moaning to himself there could be no idea now that it was a hare caught in a trap the approach was slow like that of a weak person with little halts and pauses we heard it coming along the grass straight towards the vacant doorway simson had been a little startled by the first sound he said hastily that child has no business to be out so late but he felt as well as i that this was no childs voice as it came nearer he grew silent and going to the doorway with his taper stood looking out towards the sound the taper being unprotected blew about in the night air though there was scarcely any wind i threw the light of my lantern steady and white across the same space it was in a blaze </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> blaze of light in the midst of the blackness a little icy thrill had gone over me at the first sound but as it came close i confess that my only feeling was satisfaction the scoffer could scoff no more the light touched his own face and showed a very perplexed countenance if he was afraid he concealed it with great success but he was perplexed and then all that had happened on the previous night was enacted once more it fell strangely upon me with a sense of repetition every cry every sob seemed the same as before i listened almost without any emotion at all in my own person thinking of its effect upon simson he maintained a very bold front on the whole all that coming and going of the voice was if our ears could be trusted exactly in front of the vacant blank doorway blazing full of light which caught and shone in the glistening leaves of the great hollies at a little distance not a rabbit could have crossed the turf without being seen but there was nothing </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> nothing after a time simson with a certain caution and bodily reluctance as it seemed to me went out with his roll of taper into this space his figure showed against the holly in full outline just at this moment the voice sank as was its custom and seemed to fling itself down at the door simson recoiled violently as if some one had come up against him then turned and held his taper low as if examining something do you see anybody i cried in a whisper feeling the chill of nervous panic steal over me at this action its nothing but aconfounded juniperbush he said this i knew very well to be nonsense for the juniperbush was on the other side he went about after this round and round poking his taper everywhere then returned to me on the inner side of the wall he scoffed no longer his face was contracted and pale how long does this go on he whispered to me like a man who does not wish to interrupt some one who is speaking i had become too </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> too much perturbed myself to remark whether the successions and changes of the voice were the same as last night it suddenly went out in the air almost as he was speaking with a soft reiterated sob dying away if there had been anything to be seen i should have said that the person was at that moment crouching on the ground close to the door we walked home very silent afterwards it was only when we were in sight of the house that i said what do you think of it i cant tell what to think of it he said quickly he tookthough he was a very temperate mannot the claret i was going to offer him but some brandy from the tray and swallowed it almost undiluted mind you i dont believe a word of it he said when he had lighted his candle but i cant tell what to think he turned round to add when he was halfway upstairs all of this however did me no good with the solution of my problem i was to help this weeping </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> weeping sobbing thing which was already to me as distinct a personality as anything i knew or what should i say to roland it was on my heart that my boy would die if i could not find some way of helping this creature you may be surprised that i should speak of it in this way i did not know if it was man or woman but i no more doubted that it was a soul in pain than i doubted my own being and it was my business to soothe this painto deliver it if that was possible was ever such a task given to an anxious father trembling for his only boy i felt in my heart fantastic as it may appear that i must fulfill this somehow or part with my child and you may conceive that rather than do that i was ready to die but even my dying would not have advanced me unless by bringing me into the same world with that seeker at the door next morning simson was out before breakfast and came in with </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> with evident signs of the damp grass on his boots and a look of worry and weariness which did not say much for the night he had passed he improved a little after breakfast and visited his two patientsfor bagley was still an invalid i went out with him on his way to the train to hear what he had to say about the boy he is going on very well he said there are no complications as yet but mind you thats not a boy to be trifled with mortimer not a word to him about last night i had to tell him then of my last interview with roland and of the impossible demand he had made upon me by which though he tried to laugh he was much discomposed as i could see we must just perjure ourselves all round he said and swear you exorcised it but the man was too kindhearted to be satisfied with that its frightfully serious for you mortimer i cant laugh as i should like to i wish i saw a way out of it </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> it for your sake by the way he added shortly didnt you notice that juniperbush on the lefthand side there was one on the right hand of the door i noticed you made that mistake last night mistake he cried with a curious low laugh pulling up the collar of his coat as though he felt the coldtheres no juniper there this morning left or right just go and see as he stepped into the train a few minutes after he looked back upon me and beckoned me for a parting word im coming back tonight he said i dont think i had any feeling about this as i turned away from that common bustle of the railway which made my private preoccupations feel so strangely out of date there had been a distinct satisfaction in my mind before that his scepticism had been so entirely defeated but the more serious part of the matter pressed upon me now i went straight from the railway to the manse which stood on a little plateau on the side of the river opposite to the woods </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> woods of brentwood the minister was one of a class which is not so common in scotland as it used to be he was a man of good family well educated in the scotch way strong in philosophy not so strong in greek strongest of all in experiencea man who had come across in the course of his life most people of note that had ever been in scotland and who was said to be very sound in doctrine without infringing the toleration with which old men who are good men are generally endowed he was oldfashioned perhaps he did not think so much about the troublous problems of theology as many of the young men nor ask himself any hard questions about the confession of faith but he understood human nature which is perhaps better he received me with a cordial welcome come away colonel mortimer he said im all the more glad to see you that i feel its a good sign for the boy hes doing wellgod be praisedand the lord bless him and keep him he has many a poor </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> poor bodys prayers and that can do nobody harm he will need them all dr moncrieff i said and your counsel too and i told him the storymore than i had told simson the old clergyman listened to me with many suppressed exclamations and at the end the water stood in his eyes thats just beautiful he said i do not mind to have heard anything like it its as fine as burns when he wished deliverance to onethat is prayed for in no kirk ay ay so he would have you console the poor lost spirit god bless the boy theres something more than common in that colonel mortimer and also the faith of him in his fatheri would like to put that into a sermon then the old gentleman gave me an alarmed look and said no no i was not meaning a sermon but i must write it down for the childrens record i saw the thought that passed through his mind either he thought or he feared i would think of a funeral sermon you may believe this did not </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> not make me more cheerful i can scarcely say that dr moncrieff gave me any advice how could any one advise on such a subject but he said i think ill come too im an old man im less liable to be frightened than those that are further off the world unseen it behooves me to think of my own journey there ive no cutanddry beliefs on the subject ill come too and maybe at the moment the lord will put into our heads what to do this gave me a little comfortmore than simson had given me to be clear about the cause of it was not my grand desire it was another thing that was in my mindmy boy as for the poor soul at the open door i had no more doubt as i have said of its existence than i had of my own it was no ghost to me i knew the creature and it was in trouble that was my feeling about it as it was rolands to hear it first was a great shock to my nerves </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> nerves but not now a man will get accustomed to anything but to do something for it was the great problem how was i to be serviceable to a being that was invisible that was mortal no longer maybe at the moment the lord will put it into our heads this is very oldfashioned phraseology and a week before most likely i should have smiled though always with kindness at dr moncrieffs credulity but there was a great comfort whether rational or otherwise i cannot say in the mere sound of the words the road to the station and the village lay through the glen not by the ruins but though the sunshine and the fresh air and the beauty of the trees and the sound of the water were all very soothing to the spirits my mind was so full of my own subject that i could not refrain from turning to the right hand as i got to the top of the glen and going straight to the place which i may call the scene of all my thoughts it was lying </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> lying full in the sunshine like all the rest of the world the ruined gable looked due east and in the present aspect of the sun the light streamed down through the doorway as our lantern had done throwing a flood of light upon the damp grass beyond there was a strange suggestion in the open doorso futile a kind of emblem of vanity all free around so that you could go where you pleased and yet that semblance of an enclosurethat way of entrance unnecessary leading to nothing and why any creature should pray and weep to get into nothing or be kept outby nothing you could not dwell upon it or it made your brain go round i remembered however what simson said about the juniper with a little smile on my own mind as to the inaccuracy of recollection which even a scientific man will be guilty of i could see now the light of my lantern gleaming upon the wet glistening surface of the spiky leaves at the right handand he ready to go to the stake for it that </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> that it was the left i went round to make sure and then i saw what he had said right or left there was no juniper at all i was confounded by this though it was entirely a matter of detail nothing at alla bush of brambles waving the grass growing up to the very walls but after all though it gave me a shock for a moment what did that matter there were marks as if a number of footsteps had been up and down in front of the door but these might have been our steps and all was bright and peaceful and still i poked about the other ruinthe larger ruins of the old housefor some time as i had done before there were marks upon the grass here and therei could not call them footstepsall about but that told for nothing one way or another i had examined the ruined rooms closely the first day they were half filled up with soil and debris withered brackens and brambleno refuge for any one there it vexed me that jarvis should see </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> see me coming from that spot when he came up to me for his orders i dont know whether my nocturnal expeditions had got wind among the servants but there was a significant look in his face something in it i felt was like my own sensation when simson in the midst of his scepticism was struck dumb jarvis felt satisfied that his veracity had been put beyond question i never spoke to a servant of mine in such a peremptory tone before i sent him away with a flea in his lug as the man described it afterwards interference of any kind was intolerable to me at such a moment but what was strangest of all was that i could not face roland i did not go up to his room as i would have naturally done at once this the girls could not understand they saw there was some mystery in it mother has gone to lie down agatha said he has had such a good night but he wants you so papa cried little jeanie always with her two arms embracing </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> embracing mine in a pretty way she had i was obliged to go at last but what could i say i could only kiss him and tell him to keep stillthat i was doing all i could there is something mystical about the patience of a child it will come all right wont it father he said god grant it may i hope so roland oh yes it will come all right perhaps he understood that in the midst of my anxiety i could not stay with him as i should have done otherwise but the girls were more surprised than it is possible to describe they looked at me with wondering eyes if i were ill papa and you only stayed with me a moment i should break my heart said agatha but the boy had a sympathetic feeling he knew that of my own will i would not have done it i shut myself up in the library where i could not rest but kept pacing up and down like a caged beast what could i do and if i could do </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> do nothing what would become of my boy these were the questions that without ceasing pursued each other through my mind simson came out to dinner and when the house was all still and most of the servants in bed we went out and met dr moncrieff as we had appointed at the head of the glen simson for his part was disposed to scoff at the doctor if there are to be any spells you know ill cut the whole concern he said i did not make him any reply i had not invited him he could go or come as he pleased he was very talkative far more so than suited my humor as we went on one thing is certain you know there must be some human agency he said it is all bosh about apparitions i never have investigated the laws of sound to any great extent and theres a great deal in ventriloquism that we dont know much about if its the same to you i said i wish youd keep all that to yourself simson it doesnt suit </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> suit my state of mind oh i hope i know how to respect idiosyncrasy he said the very tone of his voice irritated me beyond measure these scientific fellows i wonder people put up with them as they do when you have no mind for their coldblooded confidence dr moncrieff met us about eleven oclock the same time as on the previous night he was a large man with a venerable countenance and white hairold but in full vigor and thinking less of a cold night walk than many a younger man he had his lantern as i had we were fully provided with means of lighting the place and we were all of us resolute men we had a rapid consultation as we went up and the result was that we divided to different posts dr moncrieff remained inside the wallif you can call that inside where there was no wall but one simson placed himself on the side next the ruins so as to intercept any communication with the old house which was what his mind was fixed upon i was posted </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> posted on the other side to say that nothing could come near without being seen was selfevident it had been so also on the previous night now with our three lights in the midst of the darkness the whole place seemed illuminated dr moncrieffs lantern which was a large one without any means of shutting upan oldfashioned lantern with a pierced and ornamental topshone steadily the rays shooting out of it upward into the gloom he placed it on the grass where the middle of the room if this had been a room would have been the usual effect of the light streaming out of the doorway was prevented by the illumination which simson and i on either side supplied with these differences everything seemed as on the previous night and what occurred was exactly the same with the same air of repetition point for point as i had formerly remarked i declare that it seemed to me as if i were pushed against put aside by the owner of the voice as he paced up and down in his troublethough these are perfectly </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> perfectly futile words seeing that the stream of light from my lantern and that from simsons taper lay broad and clear without a shadow without the smallest break across the entire breadth of the grass i had ceased even to be alarmed for my part my heart was rent with pity and troublepity for the poor suffering human creature that moaned and pleaded so and trouble for myself and my boy god if i could not find any helpand what help could i findroland would die we were all perfectly still till the first outburst was exhausted as i knew by experience it would be dr moncrieff to whom it was new was quite motionless on the other side of the wall as we were in our places my heart had remained almost at its usual beating during the voice i was used to it it did not rouse all my pulses as it did at first but just as it threw itself sobbing at the door i cannot use other words there suddenly came something which sent the blood coursing through my veins </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> veins and my heart into my mouth it was a voice inside the wallthe ministers wellknown voice i would have been prepared for it in any kind of adjuration but i was not prepared for what i heard it came out with a sort of stammering as if too much moved for utterance willie willie oh god preserve us is it you these simple words had an effect upon me that the voice of the invisible creature had ceased to have i thought the old man whom i had brought into this danger had gone mad with terror i made a dash round to the other side of the wall half crazed myself with the thought he was standing where i had left him his shadow thrown vague and large upon the grass by the lantern which stood at his feet i lifted my own light to see his face as i rushed forward he was very pale his eyes wet and glistening his mouth quivering with parted lips he neither saw nor heard me we that had gone through this experience before had </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> had crouched towards each other to get a little strength to bear it but he was not even aware that i was there his whole being seemed absorbed in anxiety and tenderness he held out his hands which trembled but it seemed to me with eagerness not fear he went on speaking all the time willie if it is youand its you if it is not a delusion of satanwillie lad why come ye here frighting them that know you not why came ye not to me he seemed to wait for an answer when his voice ceased his countenance every line moving continued to speak simson gave me another terrible shock stealing into the open doorway with his light as much awestricken as wildly curious as i but the minister resumed without seeing simson speaking to some one else his voice took a tone of expostulation is this right to come here your mothers gone with your name on her lips do you think she would ever close her door on her own lad do ye think the lord will close the door </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> door ye fainthearted creature noi forbid ye i forbid ye cried the old man the sobbing voice had begun to resume its cries he made a step forward calling out the last words in a voice of command i forbid ye cry out no more to man go home ye wandering spirit go home do you hear meme that christened ye that have struggled with ye that have wrestled for ye with the lord here the loud tones of his voice sank into tenderness and her too poor woman poor woman her you are calling upon shes not here youll find her with the lord go there and seek her not here do you hear me lad go after her there hell let you in though its late man take heart if you will lie and sob and greet let it be at heavens gate and not your poor mothers ruined door he stopped to get his breath and the voice had stopped not as it had done before when its time was exhausted and all its repetitions said but with a sobbing catch </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> catch in the breath as if overruled then the minister spoke again are you hearing me will oh laddie youve liked the beggarly elements all your days be done with them now go home to the fatherthe father are you hearing me here the old man sank down upon his knees his face raised upwards his hands held up with a tremble in them all white in the light in the midst of the darkness i resisted as long as i could though i cannot tell why then i too dropped upon my knees simson all the time stood in the doorway with an expression in his face such as words could not tell his under lip dropped his eyes wild staring it seemed to be to him that image of blank ignorance and wonder that we were praying all the time the voice with a low arrested sobbing lay just where he was standing as i thought lord the minister saidlord take him into thy everlasting habitations the mother he cries to is with thee who can open to him but thee lord </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> lord when is it too late for thee or what is too hard for thee lord let that woman there draw him inower let her draw him inower i sprang forward to catch something in my arms that flung itself wildly within the door the illusion was so strong that i never paused till i felt my forehead graze against the wall and my hands clutch the groundfor there was nobody there to save from falling as in my foolishness i thought simson held out his hand to me to help me up he was trembling and cold his lower lip hanging his speech almost inarticulate its gone he said stammeringits gone we leaned upon each other for a moment trembling so much both of us that the whole scene trembled as if it were going to dissolve and disappear and yet as long as i live i will never forget itthe shining of the strange lights the blackness all round the kneeling figure with all the whiteness of the light concentrated on its white venerable head and uplifted hands a strange solemn stillness </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> stillness seemed to close all round us by intervals a single syllable lord lord came from the old ministers lips he saw none of us nor thought of us i never knew how long we stood like sentinels guarding him at his prayers holding our lights in a confused dazed way not knowing what we did but at last he rose from his knees and standing up at his full height raised his arms as the scotch manner is at the end of a religious service and solemnly gave the apostolical benedictionto what to the silent earth the dark woods the wide breathing atmosphere for we were but spectators gasping an amen it seemed to me that it must be the middle of the night as we all walked back it was in reality very late dr moncrieff put his arm into mine he walked slowly with an air of exhaustion it was as if we were coming from a deathbed something hushed and solemnized the very air there was that sense of relief in it which there always is at the end of </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> of a deathstruggle and nature persistent never daunted came back in all of us as we returned into the ways of life we said nothing to each other indeed for a time but when we got clear of the trees and reached the opening near the house where we could see the sky dr moncrieff himself was the first to speak i must be going he said its very late im afraid i will go down the glen as i came but not alone i am going with you doctor well i will not oppose it i am an old man and agitation wearies more than work yes ill be thankful of your arm tonight colonel youve done me more good turns than one i pressed his hand on my arm not feeling able to speak but simson who turned with us and who had gone along all this time with his taper flaring in entire unconsciousness came to himself apparently at the sound of our voices and put out that wild little torch with a quick movement as if of shame let me </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> me carry your lantern he said it is heavy he recovered with a spring and in a moment from the awestricken spectator he had been became himself sceptical and cynical i should like to ask you a question he said do you believe in purgatory doctor its not in the tenets of the church so far as i know sir said dr moncrieff an old man like me is sometimes not very sure what he believes there is just one thing i am certain ofand that is the lovingkindness of god but i thought that was in this life i am no theologian sir said the old man again with a tremor in him which i could feel going over all his frame if i saw a friend of mine within the gates of hell i would not despair but his father would take him by the hand still if he cried like you i allow it is very strange very strange i cannot see through it that there must be human agency i feel sure doctor what made you decide upon the person </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> person and the name the minister put out his hand with the impatience which a man might show if he were asked how he recognized his brother tuts he said in familiar speech then more solemnly how should i not recognize a person that i know betterfar betterthan i know you then you saw the man dr moncrieff made no reply he moved his hand again with a little impatient movement and walked on leaning heavily on my arm and we went on for a long time without another word threading the dark paths which were steep and slippery with the damp of the winter the air was very stillnot more than enough to make a faint sighing in the branches which mingled with the sound of the water to which we were descending when we spoke again it was about indifferent mattersabout the height of the river and the recent rains we parted with the minister at his own door where his old housekeeper appeared in great perturbation waiting for him eh me minister the young gentleman will be worse she cried far </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> far from thatbetter god bless him dr moncrieff said i think if simson had begun again to me with his questions i should have pitched him over the rocks as we returned up the glen but he was silent by a good inspiration and the sky was clearer than it had been for many nights shining high over the trees with here and there a star faintly gleaming through the wilderness of dark and bare branches the air as i have said was very soft in them with a subdued and peaceful cadence it was real like every natural sound and came to us like a hush of peace and relief i thought there was a sound in it as of the breath of a sleeper and it seemed clear to me that roland must be sleeping satisfied and calm we went up to his room when we went in there we found the complete hush of rest my wife looked up out of a doze and gave me a smile i think he is a great deal better but you are very late </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> late she said in a whisper shading the light with her hand that the doctor might see his patient the boy had got back something like his own color he woke as we stood all round his bed his eyes had the happy halfawakened look of childhood glad to shut again yet pleased with the interruption and glimmer of the light i stooped over him and kissed his forehead which was moist and cool all is well roland i said he looked up at me with a glance of pleasure and took my hand and laid his cheek upon it and so went to sleep for some nights after i watched among the ruins spending all the dark hours up to midnight patrolling about the bit of wall which was associated with so many emotions but i heard nothing and saw nothing beyond the quiet course of nature nor so far as i am aware has anything been heard again dr moncrieff gave me the history of the youth whom he never hesitated to name i did not ask as simson did how he </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> he recognized him he had been a prodigalweak foolish easily imposed upon and led away as people say all that we had heard had passed actually in life the doctor said the young man had come home thus a day or two after his mother diedwho was no more than the housekeeper in the old houseand distracted with the news had thrown himself down at the door and called upon her to let him in the old man could scarcely speak of it for tears to me it seemed as ifheaven help us how little do we know about anythinga scene like that might impress itself somehow upon the hidden heart of nature i do not pretend to know how but the repetition had struck me at the time as in its terrible strangeness and incomprehensibility almost mechanicalas if the unseen actor could not exceed or vary but was bound to reenact the whole one thing that struck me however greatly was the likeness between the old minister and my boy in the manner of regarding these strange phenomena dr moncrieff was not terrified </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> terrified as i had been myself and all the rest of us it was no ghost as i fear we all vulgarly considered it to himbut a poor creature whom he knew under these conditions just as he had known him in the flesh having no doubt of his identity and to roland it was the same this spirit in painif it was a spiritthis voice out of the unseenwas a poor fellowcreature in misery to be succored and helped out of his trouble to my boy he spoke to me quite frankly about it when he got better i knew father would find out some way he said and this was when he was strong and well and all idea that he would turn hysterical or become a seer of visions had happily passed away i must add one curious fact which does not seem to me to have any relation to the above but which simson made great use of as the human agency which he was determined to find somehow we had examined the ruins very closely at the time of </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> of these occurrences but afterwards when all was over as we went casually about them one sunday afternoon in the idleness of that unemployed day simson with his stick penetrated an old window which had been entirely blocked up with fallen soil he jumped down into it in great excitement and called me to follow there we found a little holefor it was more a hole than a roomentirely hidden under the ivy and ruins in which there was a quantity of straw laid in a corner as if some one had made a bed there and some remains of crusts about the floor some one had lodged there and not very long before he made out and that this unknown being was the author of all the mysterious sounds we heard he is convinced i told you it was human agency he said triumphantly he forgets i suppose how he and i stood with our lights seeing nothing while the space between us was audibly traversed by something that could speak and sob and suffer there is no argument with men of this </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> this kind he is ready to get up a laugh against me on this slender ground i was puzzled myselfi could not make it outbut i always felt convinced human agency was at the bottom of it and here it isand a clever fellow he must have been the doctor says bagley left my service as soon as he got well he assured me it was no want of respect but he could not stand them kind of things and the man was so shaken and ghastly that i was glad to give him a present and let him go for my own part i made a point of staying out the timetwo yearsfor which i had taken brentwood but i did not renew my tenancy by that time we had settled and found for ourselves a pleasant home of our own i must add that when the doctor defies me i can always bring back gravity to his countenance and a pause in his railing when i remind him of the juniperbush to me that was a matter of little importance i could </highSuspense4>
