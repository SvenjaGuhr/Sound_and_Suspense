        <body>  <lowSuspense1> the young calini was descended of a good family was heir </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> heir to great and stillincreasing wealth was the last representative of an honorable house and the delight and admiration not only of his doting parent but of every body who knew him he possessed every grace of mental perfection </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> perfection for his education had been conducted on so liberal a plan that a clear just and accurate perception had been the happy result of his juvenile studies his person was every way answerable to the above delineation of </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> of his mind his make exhibited the truest symmetry and his countenance beamed with masculine dignity corrected with a gracious condescension although calini was reared up in the principles of the romish church that did not hinder him from </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> from seeing some of its absurdities and therefore while some of the votaries placed the essence of their religion in a gaudy exhibition of pompous ceremonies his consisted in a steady uniform system of good actions an undeviating rectitude </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> rectitude of conduct prompted by the motive of his present and everlasting interest as well as by the intrinsic beauty of benevolence such was the youth whom we have selected for the hero of these memoirs one day his </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> his father as the youth had ever considered him took him aside and spake as follows the substance of what i am now going to unfold i once thought i should have buried in oblivion but upon mature deliberation </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> deliberation i am come to a determination of entrusting you with it you have always been thought to be my son this is the moment to undeceive you you are not my child not your son exclaimed the youth </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> youth in the utmost astonishment whose then can i be that you will never probably know replied signor calini but you have not many obligations to your parents who left you to perish in your infancy my story excites </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> excites your astonishment listen attentively while i disclose the circumstance which induced me to bring you up as my own offspring about twenty years ago as i was landing from a gondola one dark night on the northern shores </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> shores of the adriatic after i had returned from visiting one of my estates my sight was struck with a white bundle within a foot from the waves on examining which i found it contained an infant it was </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> was yourself and i resolved that the direful intention of those who left you should not only be frustrated but i would adopt you as my son two of mine having recently died when i got home i examined </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> examined the bundle more accurately and was surprised to see this ring here he presented one to the astonished youth you see it is of a peculiar make there is some name underneath the young man turned it and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> and saw the world ollorini engraved on it i bed that from this day you would wear it to remind you of the singular event and be assured my dear boy although you are not the natural issue of </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> of my own loins yet i shall always feel for you a fathers tenderness here signor calini concluded his narration and left his auditor overwhelmed with astonishment the barbarity of his real parents affected him severely but the kindness </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> kindness of the signor afforded him a continual source of the most pleasing sensation a short time after this wondrous disclosure young calini for so we shall still call him had been to visit a young lady to whom </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> whom he was sincerely attached and was now returning home on horseback the night was far advanced and very threatening his road lay through a dark wood in the midst of which he was seized by two men who </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> who dragged him along till they came to the ruins of an old castle where they halted till one who had a lamp sought for a door and at length told his comrade he had found it they then </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> then led our hero through a door and entered a gloomy stone dungeon a strong chain which was fastened to an enormous staple in the wall discovered to the youth the horrors which awaited him here said one of </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> of the ruffians here is your habitation till you resign all pretensions to lady alexa our young lover now saw through the whole affair he had been seized by order of a rival but who this rival was he </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> he had no means of judging the inhuman monsters chained him to the wall and without speaking another word left the dungeon this mysterious event we shall now unfold there lived in the neighbourhood of calini a man called </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> called sceloni of a gloomy character and who was never seen once to smile he was dependant on a nobleman and had from motives of selfinterest engaged to administer to his lewd propensities this nobleman was enamoured of the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> the very same lady our hero loved seeing no possibility of supplanting him in her affection he called in the aid of the dark sceloni to whom he promised great pecuniary rewards if he would dispatch his rival and </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> and secure to him the possession of alexa the avaricious italian undertook to perform what he required for this purpose he waylaid the youth on his return from alexas house as we have observed but as he did not </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> not wish to embrue his hands in blood if it could be done without he had conveyed him to the ruins of the castle whose intricate windings he well knew here he meant to keep him till he should </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> should be able to extort an oath from him that he would for ever resign all pretensions to alexa when he left the dungeon he went directly to his employer and told him the rival of his love was </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> was removed beyond the possibility of again being formidable signor holbruzi took these words to mean no less than the death of the youth and therefore he reaped the golden reward he aimed at but notwithstanding this alexa was </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> was decidedly against his suit and as she could not but be surprised at calinis unaccountable absence as well as very much affected at it she not only conceived addition disgust at hobruzfs address but began to be suspicious </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> suspicious of some base design having been executed against calini in the mean time that unfortunate youth was suffering the severest extremities of imprisonment and calling in vain on his dear alexa he was visited in the dungeon frequently </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> frequently by sceloni who endeavored by every means in his power to make him resign all pretension to alexa but he was steady in his refusal nor did he yield even when he was threatened with assassination calini was </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> was as unsuccessful in trying to discover the name and quality of his rival as sceloni was in extorting a resignation of alexa after sceloni had quitted the dungeon the miserable youth began to reflect anew on his unhappy </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> unhappy situation he saw no probability of being united to the beloved object of his soul why not then resign her there was something in this word which seemed to imply cowardice and he pertinaciously objected it holbruzi finding </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> finding alexa so little disposed to favor his passion was resolved to possess her at all events he ordered sceloni to force her from her home and bring her to his palace which under cover of a dark night </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> night he effected alexa was left an orphan at an early age and after her parents death she was reared up by a tender aunt who loved her as her own child but having a very slender income necessity </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> necessity had obliged her to part with an estate in piedmont and she had purchased a small but near villa in the neighborhood of naples where she resided with her beloved niece the young calini had found them out </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> out in their retirement and had made his addresses to the fair alexa which at first was discouraged by the aunt not as she had any objection to the youth on the contrary she was convinced he was worthy </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> worthy of her niece but she knew the girl was his inferior in point of fortune yet when she found how firm he had taken hold of alexas heart and likewise heard of the liberal sentiments of signor calini </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> calini she no longer opposed the mutual bias of their young and innocent hearts things were in this situation when calini discontinued so unaccountably to them at least his visits this circumstance severe as it was to the young </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> young lady was also felt by the aunt who had conceived the greatest friendship for him but her sorrows were unspeakably acute when one night several ruffians broke into the hose and tore away her beloved alexa these were </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> were the cruel sceloni and his emissaries who conveyed her to the monster holbruzi as already related but that lascivious wretch did not yet find his end answered the persecuted maid was enabled to make a vigorous resistance to </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> to his meretricious wishes force he could have employed but this he determined to delay till every other method had been tried he thought no way so likely to weaken her virtuous resolutions as to let her know that </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> that her union with calini was impossible as that being was no longer an inhabitant of earth this fatal intelligence overwhelmed her unfortunate breast with fresh despair and rendered holbruzi more than ever an object of disgust and abhorrence </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> abhorrence his pride was severely mortified by her fixed dislike and undisguised contempt in this unreasonable moment sceloni solicited a new supply for his late services in bringing alexa to his palace holbruzi smarting with the indifference of that </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> that female answered sternly that his trifling services had already been more than sufficiently rewarded and after rebuking him sharply for his avarice absolutely refused to give him another carlin fourpence of our money sceloni seemed all humility but </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> but he quitted the palace with a soul full of revenge to accomplish which he concerted a deeplaid scheme he retired to the outskirts of the city wrote to holbruzi that he was leaving for his monastery for this </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> this wretch was of an holy order and going to a different part of the world but conjured him to release the young calini who he confessed was alive but imprisoned and he described a dungeon where the youth </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> youth was not after he had sent this letter he provided himself with a brace of pistols and repaired to that very dungeon which he had mentioned in his letter as the prison of calini here he threw himself </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> himself on the ground and personating the distress of that unfortunate youth waited deliberately for holbruzis arrival for he never foubted but that vindictive tyrant would come to sacrifice calini with his own hand he was not deceived in </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> in his conjecture when that monster received the monks letter his countenance bespoke the savage passions it inspired what said he my detested rival living this night he breathes his last he accordingly stole away that very evening muffled </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> muffled up in a disguise with a lamp in one hand and a dagger in the other through the dark passages of the ruins sceloni heard him coming and uttered a groan on purpose to direct his steps to </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> to the dungeon where he was sceloni soon heard the door unfasted and he kept his finger close to the trigger holbruzi cautiously advanced the light and then entered the subtle sceloni lady a if he was in a </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> a disturbed sleep holbruzi drew near and as he bent over him exclaimed favored minion wilt thou ever more rival me in love thou sleepest awake in he would have said death but at this moment the pseudocalini pressed </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> pressed the trigger and dismissed his soul from the world but sceloni was not yet satisfied his revengeful soul thirsted for more blood he considered that if calini had resigned alexa that maid out of revenge might have yielded </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> yielded to holbruzi and consequently he should not have met with that mortifying refusal from him which had stimulated him to take the bloody means that he had just executed his vindictive spirit resolving upon a double revenge marked </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> marked calini for a second victim no sooner had he made this horrible determination but snatching up the lamp which had not been extinguished in falling and the yet bloodless dagger he rushed out of the dungeon into that </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> that of the destined youth fully resolved to accomplish his dreadful purpose the report of the pistol as it was at a considerable distance from him and vented in a closepent dungeon did not reach his auditory nerves and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> and he was yet in a deep slumber with his right hand on his breast sceloni drew near to strike but on observing the position of his hand stooped down to remove it the rays of light discovered the </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> the ring which his supposed father desired him to wear it excited scelonis curiosity he gently drew it off and examined it by the lamp each moment furnished new alarm to his terrified mind his face assumed an ashy </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> ashy paleness his jointed trembled with amazement and horror but when he turned it up and saw the engraved name of ollorini upon it his horror and astonishment was complete he hastily threw away the dagger and awaking the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> the youth interrogated him about the mysterious ring he could only relate what his supposed father had told him this was enough sceloni while convulsive sobs burst from his torn bosom could only exclaim i am your father the </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> the astonished youth looked up and thought his reason was unsettled but seeing his tears and groans he knew not what to think at length he desired him to give some indubitable proof that he was his father i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> i will my son i will do it answered sceloni but this is not a proper place for conversation let me unbind you from these ignominious chains he then freed the youth from his fetters and they left the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> the dungeon together and retired to a small house where after they had entered a private room he addressed the wondering impatient youth as follows although in reciting those circumstances which prove you to be my son i must </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> must criminate myself yet i shall not hesitate to do it as i am sensible that you have more virtue than to conspire against the life of your father here he paused a moment for he recollected that he </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> he himself had conspired against the life of his son at length he proceeded my real name is dictori i was brought up under very indulgent parents my natural temper which was violent in the extreme was put into </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> into a hotbed by the unreasonable and fatal indulgence of those parents tis that indulgence which has caused my ruin if they had done their duty and restrained by due correction the impetuosity of my natural temper i should </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> should not have been a prey to those destructive passions of my nature which have since acted as gourds to prick me forward down the slipper path of vice i was early attached to a lady whose name was </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> was mariana vicenza but my native pride was severely wounded when i discovered that she not only beheld me with indifference but with a fixed dislike i now through obstinacy advanced my suit with more eagerness than ever when </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> when it would have been more honorable silently to withdraw it however her parents obliged her to accept of my hand at the altar as i never could forgive the little affection she had shown for me i soon </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> soon began to retaliate upon her after marriage among other passions which i vented upon her without mercy the demon of jealousy began to agitate my restless breast with its hydra horrors i thought it was very probably that </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> that she who was forced to marry a man whom she did not like should entertain in his absence one she did my suspicions were strengthened by seeing this very ring upon her finger which i apprehended was given </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> given her by her gallant i went so far as to believe you was his child in a frenzy of rage i murdered my wife and committed you to the waves together with the detested and fatal ring i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> i have had proof since that the very ring was given her before marriage by an uncle who had gone beyond sea that he had his name engraved on it which was ollorini as i was afraid to stay </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> stay in that part i came to naples and become a monk of the order of st francis spare me the rest this truly wonderful relation affected the astonished youth a great deal but we must take leave of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of calini a little while to look after the lovely persecuted alexa that unfortunate maid was ready to abandon herself to despair torn away fro her peaceful retreat by ruffians t the dreadful the horrorworking hour of midnight to </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> to fall a prey to the unbridled lust of a lewd barbarian separated from her dear aunt torn too from the fond the protected arms of the youth she sighed for what can exeed her misery wretched captive as </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> as she then was in the most hated mansion of the nefarious monster holbruzi for she as yet knew nothing of the sanguinary scenes which had been exhibited in the castleruins the savage holbruzi when he left his house </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> house at midnight had consigned the wretched maid to one of his trusty servants who executed with relentless rigor the confidence reposed in him we now for a short time turn from the unhappy beauty to see the mournful </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> mournful effect which her loss had upon her disconsolate aunt that distressed matron now separate by cruel fate from a beloved niece in whom her very existence seemed to be wrapt up experience the most poignant anguish that can </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> can possibly be imagined she wrung her aged hands in wild despair and in frantic accents called on her faroff niece her dear alexa while she was in the heighth of her lamentation a knocking at the door was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was heard for a considerable time she was afraid to open it least in so doing she should let in those who ravished from her embraces her beloved niece and thereby become herself a victim of their savage fury </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> fury but while she hesitated what to do she heard a voice at the door requesting admission the cadence of which she thought she remembered though her distress would not permit her to be certain to whom it belonged </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> belonged she however assumed courage sufficient to open it when calini directly rushed in as he knew nothing of alexa being at holbruzis detested mansion he as soon as he left the monk repaired to her residence though not </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> not without dreadful apprehensions for her safety occasioned by the silence of sceloni on his asking after her it may perhaps be thought strange that the monk should not have told his son where she was seeing he knew </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> knew she was at holbruzis palace but if we consider that he had been some time absent from naples and that he knew so much of that villain as to think it probable that he had murdered that maid </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> maid before he intended to assassinate her lover we shall cease to wonder at his conduct add to this that if he had discovered to calini that alexa was at holbruzis mansion it would naturally have introduced an inquiry </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> inquiry into that monsters mysterious absence an inquiry which would doubtless have directed the finger of suspicion to himself this was what the monk dreaded should transpire he had already dipped his hands so deep in blood that his </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> his conscience was already pointing to the gibbet or the inquisitional torture he had therefore preserved an obstinate silence respecting alexa and our hero unable to endure the tortures of suspense flew upon the pinions of indescribable anxiety to </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> to her aunts as already mentioned the reputed father of our hero received his foster son with the greatest joy imaginable and heard with astonishment and horror the circumstances which had happened to him he was however severely afflicted </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> afflicted at the loss of the amiable alexa for that lovely maid stood very high both in his esteem and affection and he had beheld the growing love which the youth evinced for her with cheerful approbation it excited </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> excited his utmost surprise to think who could possibly have stolen her from her peaceful home he little thought that it was the machinations of one who often partook of his hospitality and had been a frequent visitor at </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> at his festive board but this very consideration enabled our hero to trace out her persecutor and her present prison he recollected holbruzi being at his fathers as he then thought him as likewise that he was always exceedingly </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> exceedingly discourteous to himself the occasion of which he had in vain attempted to unravel but now it appeared plain enough calini considered also that he knew perfectly well of his love for alexa and also the place of </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> of that young ladys residence when therefore he in his cooler moments put all of these circumstances together the suspicions they excited were so strong that our unfortunate youth found it impossible to think otherways than that he must </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> must be certainly somehow concerned if not the principal agent in the removal of the unfortunate girl influence by this supposition he determined to go directly to the palace of holbruzi to see if the beloved of his soul </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> soul was really there but upon second thoughts he resolved to await all night and set spies in the mean time about the house to discover if possible the secret transactions going forward in it the spires brought him </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> him intelligence that they saw a young lady superficially through one of the windows leaning upon her arm in a melancholy posture and that she appeared to be in extreme distress this was sufficient to stimulate our hero to </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> to instant exertion he directly went with a desperate determination well armed resolving if they denied him admission to force the door but the servant admitted him upon the first summons expecting it was his master our hero instantly </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> instantly rushed up stairs and hearing a female scream he broke into the room and beheld his beloved alexa struggling in the embraces of a ruffian whom he severely wounded and rescued the lovely maid how was she rejoiced </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> rejoiced to see her dear her loved calini sceloni had the satisfaction of seeing them happy before he retired for life to his monastery he now found no difficulty in being united to his dear alexa whose marriage was </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> was celebrated amid an amazing multitude of admiring spectators the monk after this was never seen beyond the walls of his convent but passed his life in the most rigorous penance </highSuspense4>
