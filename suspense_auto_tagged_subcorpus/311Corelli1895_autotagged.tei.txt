 <lowSuspense3> i do you know what it is to be poor not poor with the arrogant poverty complained of by certain people who have five or six thousand a year to live upon and who yet swear they can hardly manage to make both ends meet but really poordownright cruelly hideously poor with a poverty that is graceless sordid and miserable poverty that compels you to dress in your one suit of clothes till it is worn threadbarethat denies you clean linen on account of the ruinous charges of washerwomenthat robs you of your own selfrespect and causes you to slink along the streets vaguely abashed instead of walking erect among your fellowmen in independent easethis is the sort of poverty i mean this is the grinding curse that keeps down noble aspiration under a load of ignoble care this is the moral cancer that eats into the heart of an otherwise wellintentioned human creature and makes him envious and malignant and inclined to the use of dynamite when he sees the fat idle woman of society passing by in her luxurious carriage lolling back lazily her face mottled with the purple and red signs of superfluous eatingwhen he observes the brainless and sensual man of fashion smoking and dawdling away the hours in the park as if all the world and its millions of honest hard workers were created solely for the casual diversion of the socalled upper classesthen the good blood in him turns to gall and his suffering spirit rises in fierce rebellion crying outwhy in gods name should this injustice be why should a worthless lounger have his pockets full of gold by mere chance and heritage while i toiling wearily from morn till midnight can scarce afford myself a satisfying meal why indeed why should the wicked flourish like a green baytree i have often thought about it now however i believe i could help to solve the problem out of my own personal experience but such an experience who will credit it who will believe that anything so strange and terrific ever chanced to the lot of a mortal man no one yet it is truetruer than much socalled truth moreover i know that many men are living through many such incidents as have occurred to me under precisely the same influence conscious perhaps at times that they are in the tangles of sin but too weak of will to break the net in which they have become voluntarily imprisoned will they be taught i wonder the lesson i have learned in the same bitter school under the same formidable taskmaster will they realize as i have been forced to doaye to the very fibres of my intellectual perceptionthe vast individual active mind which behind all matter works unceasingly though silently a very eternal and positive god if so then dark problems will become clear to them and what seems injustice in the world will prove pure equity but i do not write with any hope of either persuading or enlightening my fellowmen i know their obstinacy too welli can gauge it by my own my proud belief in myself was at one time not to be outdone by any human unit on the face of the globe and i am aware that others are in similar case i merely intend to relate the various incidents of my career in due order exactly as they happenedleaving to more confident heads the business of propounding and answering the riddles of human existence as best they may during a certain bitter winter long remembered for its arctic severity when a great wave of intense cold spread freezing influences not alone over the happy isles of britain but throughout all europe i geoffrey tempest was alone in london and wellnigh starving now a starving man seldom gets the sympathy he meritsso few can be persuaded to believe in him worthy folks who have just fed to repletion are the most incredulous some of them being even moved to smile when told of existing hungry people much as if these were occasional jests invented for afterdinner amusement or with that irritating vagueness of attention which characterizes fashionable folk to such an extent that when asking a question they neither wait for the answer nor understand it when given the welldined groups hearing of some one starved to death will idly murmur how dreadful and at once turn to the discussion of the latest fad for killing time ere it takes to killing them with sheer ennui the pronounced fact of being hungry sounds coarse and common and is </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> is not a topic for polite society which always eats more than sufficient for its needs at the period i am speaking of however i who have since been one of the most envied of men knew the cruel meaning of the word hunger too wellthe gnawing pain the sick faintness the deadly stupor the insatiable animal craving for mere food all of which sensations are frightful enough to those who are unhappily daily inured to them but which when they afflict one who has been tenderly reared and brought up to consider himself a gentlemangod save the mark are perhaps still more painful to bear and i felt that i had not deserved to suffer the wretchedness in which i found myself i had worked hard from the time my father died leaving me to discover that every penny of the fortune i imagined he possessed was due to swarming creditors and that nothing of all our house and estate was left to me except a jewelled miniature of my mother who had lost her own life in giving me birthfrom that time i say i had put my shoulder to the wheel and toiled late and early i had turned my university education to the only use for which it or i seemed fittedliterature i had sought for employment on almost every journal in londonrefused by many taken on trial by some but getting steady pay from none whoever seeks to live by brain and pen alone is at the beginning of such a career treated as a sort of social pariah nobody wants himeverybody despises him his efforts are derided his manuscripts are flung back to him unread and he is less cared for than the condemned murderer in gaol the murderer is at least fed and clotheda worthy clergyman visits him and his gaoler will occasionally condescend to play cards with him but a man gifted with original thoughts and the power of expressing them appears to be regarded by everyone in authority as much worse than the worst criminal and all the jacksinoffice unite to kick him to death if they can i took both kicks and blows in sullen silence and lived onnot for the love of life but simply because i scorned the cowardice of selfdestruction i was young enough not to part with hope too easilythe vague idea i had that my turn would comethat the evercircling wheel of fortune would perchance lift me up some day as it now crushed me down kept me just wearily capable of continuing existencethough it was merely a continuance and no more for about six months i got some reviewing work on a wellknown literary journal thirty novels a week were sent to me to criticisei made a habit of glancing hastily at about eight or ten of them and writing one column of rattling abuse concerning these thus casually selectedthe remainder were never noticed at all i found that this mode of action was considered smart and i managed for a time to please my editor who paid me the munificent sum of fifteen shillings for my weekly labour but on one fatal occasion i happened to change my tactics and warmly praised a work which my own conscience told me was both original and excellent the author of it happened to be an old enemy of the proprietor of the journal on which i was employedmy eulogistic review of the hated individual unfortunately for me appeared with the result that private spite outweighed public justice and i was immediately dismissed after this i dragged on in a sufficiently miserable way doing hack work for the dailies and living on promises that never became realities till as i have said in the early january of the bitter winter alluded to i found myself literally penniless and face to face with starvation owing a months rent besides for the poor lodging i occupied in a back street not far from the british museum i had been out all day trudging from one newspaper office to another seeking for work and finding none every available post was filled i had also tried unsuccessfully to dispose of a manuscript of my owna work of fiction which i knew had some merit but which all the readers in the publishing offices appeared to find exceptionally worthless these readers i learned were most of them novelists themselves who read other peoples productions in their spare moments and passed judgment on them i have always failed to see the justice of this arrangement to me it seems merely the way to foster mediocrities and suppress originality common sense points out the fact that the novelist reader who has a place to maintain for himself in literature would naturally rather encourage work that is likely to prove ephemeral than that which might possibly take a higher footing than his own be this as it may and however good or bad the system it was entirely prejudicial to me and my literary offspring the last publisher i tried was a kindly man who looked at my shabby clothes and gaunt face with some commiseration im sorry said he very sorry but my readers are quite unanimous from what i can learn it seems to me you have been too earnest and also rather sarcastic in certain strictures against society my dear fellow that wont do never blame societyit buys books now if you could write a smart lovestory slightly risqueven a little more than risqu for that matter that is the sort of thing that suits the present age pardon me i interposed somewhat wearilybut are you sure you judge the public taste correctly he smiled a bland smile of indulgent amusement at what he no doubt considered my ignorance in putting such a query of course i am surehe repliedit is my business to know the public taste as thoroughly as i know my own pocket understand mei dont suggest that you should write a book on any positively indecent subjectthat can be safely left to the new womanand he laughedbut i assure you highclass fiction doesnt sell the critics dont like it to begin with what goes down with them and with the public is a bit of sensational realism told in terse newspaper english literary englishaddisonian englishis a mistake and i am also a mistake i think i said with a forced smileat any rate if what you say be true i must lay down the pen and try another trade i am oldfashioned enough to consider literature as the highest of all professions and i would rather not join in with those who voluntarily degrade it he gave me a quick sideglance of mingled incredulity and depreciation well well he finally observedyou are a little quixotic that will wear off will you come on to my club and dine with me i refused this invitation promptly i knew the man saw and recognised my wretched plightand pridefalse pride if you willrose up to my rescue i bade him a hurried goodday and started back to my lodging carrying my rejected manuscript with me arrived there my landlady met me as i was about to ascend the stairs and asked me whether i would kindly settle accounts the next day she spoke civilly enough poor soul and not without a certain compassionate hesitation in her manner her evident pity for me galled my spirit as much as the publishers offer of a dinner had wounded my prideand with a perfectly audacious air of certainty i at once promised her the money at the time she herself appointed though i had not the least idea where or how i should get the required sum once past her and shut in my own room i flung my useless manuscript on the floor and myself into a chair andswore it refreshed me to swear and it seemed naturalfor though temporarily weakened by lack of food i was not yet so weak as to shed tearsand a fierce formidable oath was to me the same sort of physical relief which i imagine a fit of weeping may be to an excitable woman just as i could not shed tears so was i incapable of apostrophizing god in my despair to speak frankly i did not believe in any godthen i was to myself an allsufficing mortal scorning the timeworn superstitions of socalled religion of course i had been brought up in the christian faith but that creed had become worse than useless to me since i had intellectually realized the utter inefficiency of christian ministers to deal with difficult lifeproblems spiritually i was adrift in chaosmentally i was hindered both in thought and achievementbodily i was reduced to want my case was desperatei myself was desperate it was a moment when if ever good and evil angels play a game of chance for a mans soul they were surely throwing the dice on the last wager for mine and yet with it all i felt i had done my best i was driven into a corner by my fellowmen who grudged me space to live in but i had fought against it i had worked honestly and patientlyall to no purpose i knew of rogues who gained plenty of money and of knaves who were amassing large fortunes their prosperity appeared to prove that </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> that honesty after all was not the best policy what should i do then how should i begin the jesuitical business of committing evil that good personal good might come of it so i thought dully if such stray halfstupefied fancies as i was capable of deserved the name of thought the night was bitter cold my hands were numbed and i tried to warm them at the oillamp my landlady was good enough to still allow me the use of in spite of delayed cashpayments as i did so i noticed three letters on the tableone in a long blue envelope suggestive of either a summons or a returned manuscriptone bearing the melbourne postmark and the third a thick square missive coroneted in red and gold at the back i turned over all three indifferently and selecting the one from australia balanced it in my hand a moment before opening it i knew from whom it came and idly wondered what news it brought me some months previously i had written a detailed account of my increasing debts and difficulties to an old college chum who finding england too narrow for his ambition had gone out to the wider new world on a speculative quest of gold mining he was getting on well so i understood and had secured a fairly substantial position and i had therefore ventured to ask him pointblank for the loan of fifty pounds here no doubt was his reply and i hesitated before breaking the seal of course it will be a refusal i said halfaloudhowever kindly a friend may otherwise be he soon turns crusty if asked to lend money he will express many regrets accuse trade and the general bad times and hope i will soon tide over i know the sort of thing wellafter all why should i expect him to be different to other men ive no claim on him beyond the memory of a few sentimental arminarm days at oxford a sigh escaped me in spite of myself and a mist blurred my sight for the moment again i saw the grey towers of peaceful magdalen and the fair green trees shading the walks in and around the dear old university town where wei and the man whose letter i now held in my handstrolled about together as happy youths fancying that we were young geniuses born to regenerate the world we were both fond of classicswe were brimful of homer and the thoughts and maxims of all the immortal greeks and latinsand i verily believe in those imaginative days we thought we had in us such stuff as heroes are made of but our entrance into the social arena soon robbed us of our sublime conceitwe were common working units no morethe grind and prose of daily life put homer into the background and we soon discovered that society was more interested in the latest unsavoury scandal than in the tragedies of sophocles or the wisdom of plato well it was no doubt extremely foolish of us to dream that we might help to regenerate a world in which both plato and chris appear to have failedyet the most hardened cynic will scarcely deny that it is pleasant to look back to the days of his youth if he can think that at least then if only once in his life he had noble impulses the lamp burned badly and i had to retrim it before i could settle down to read my friends letter next door someone was playing a violin and playing it well tenderly and yet with a certain amount of brio the notes came dancing from the bow and i listened vaguely pleased being faint with hunger i was somewhat in a listless state bordering on stuporand the penetrating sweetness of the music appealing to the sensuous and sthetic part of me drowned for the moment mere animal craving there you go i murmured apostrophizing the unseen musicianpractising away on that friendly fiddle of yoursno doubt for a mere pittance which barely keeps you alive possibly you are some poor wretch in a cheap orchestraor you might even be a streetplayer and be able to live in this neighbourhood of the lite starvingyou can have no hope whatever of being the fashion and making your bow before royaltyor if you have that hope it is wildly misplaced play on my friend play onthe sounds you make are very agreeable and seem to imply that you are happy i wonder if you areor if like me you are going rapidly to the devil the music grew softer and more plaintive and was now accompanied by the rattle of hailstones against the windowpanes a gusty wind whistled under the door and roared down the chimneya wind cold as the grasp of death and searching as a probing knife i shiveredand bending close over the smoky lamp prepared to read my australian news as i opened the envelope a bill for fifty pounds payable to me at a wellknown london bankers fell out upon the table my heart gave a quick bound of mingled relief and gratitude why jack old fellow i wronged you i exclaimedyour heart is in the right place after all and profoundly touched by my friends ready generosity i eagerly perused his letter it was not very long and had evidently been written off in haste dear geoff im sorry to hear you are down on your luck it shows what a crop of fools are still flourishing in london when a man of your capability cannot gain his proper place in the world of letters and be fittingly acknowledged i believe its all a question of wirepulling and money is the only thing that will pull the wires heres the fifty you ask for and welcomedont hurry about paying it back i am doing you a good turn this year by sending you a frienda real friend mind youno sham he brings you a letter of introduction from me and between ourselves old man you cannot do better than put yourself and your literary affairs entirely in his hands he knows everybody and is up to all the dodges of editorial management and newspaper cliques he is a great philanthropist besidesand seems particularly fond of the society of the clergy rather a queer taste you will say but his reason for such preference is as he has explained to me quite frankly that he is so enormously wealthy that he does not quite know what to do with his money and the reverend gentlemen of the church are generally ready to show him how to spend some of it he is always glad to know of some quarter where his money and influence he is very influential may be useful to others he has helped me out of a very serious hobble and i owe him a big debt of gratitude ive told him all about youwhat a smart fellow you are and what a lot dear old alma mater thought of you and he has promised to give you a lift up he can do anything he likes very naturally seeing that the whole world of morals civilization and the rest is subservient to the power of moneyand his stock of cash appears to be limitless use him he is willing and ready to be usedand write and let me know how you get on dont bother about the fifty till you feel you have tided over the storm ever yours boffles i laughed as i read the absurd signature though my eyes were dim with something like tears boffles was the nickname given to my friend by several of our college companions and neither he nor i knew how it first arose but no one except the dons ever addressed him by his proper name which was john carringtonhe was simply boffles and boffles he remained even now for all those who had been his intimates i refolded and put by his letter and the draft for the fifty pounds and with a passing vague wonder as to what manner of man the philanthropist might be who had more money than he knew what to do with i turned to the consideration of my other two correspondents relieved to feel that now whatever happened i could settle up arrears with my landlady the next day as i had promised moreover i could order some supper and have a fire lit to cheer my chilly room before attending to these creature comforts however i opened the long blue envelope that looked so like a threat of legal proceedings and unfolding the paper within stared at it amazedly what was it all about the written characters danced before my eyespuzzled and bewildered i found myself reading the thing over and over again without any clear comprehension of it presently a glimmer of meaning flashed upon me startling my senses like an electric shock nonoimpossible fortune never could be so mad as thisnever so wildly capricious and grotesque of humour it was some senseless hoax that was being practised upon me and yet if it were a joke it was a very elaborate and remarkable one weighted with the majesty of the law too upon my word and by all the fantastical freakish destinies that govern human affairs the news seemed actually positive and </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense4> and genuine ii steadying my thoughts with an effort i read every word of the document over again deliberately and the stupefaction of my wonder increased was i going mad or sickening for a fever or could this startling this stupendous piece of information be really true becauseif indeed it were true good heavensi turned giddy to think of itand it was only by sheer force of will that i kept myself from swooning with the agitation of such sudden surprise and ecstasy if it were truewhy then the world was minei was king instead of beggari was everything i chose to be the letterthe amazing letter bore the printed name of a noted firm of london solicitors and stated in measured and precise terms that a distant relative of my fathers of whom i had scarcely heard except remotely now and then during my boyhood had died suddenly in south america leaving me his sole heir the real and personal estate now amounting to something over five millions of pounds sterling we should esteem it a favour if you could make it convenient to call upon us any day this week in order that we may go through the necessary formalities together the larger bulk of the cash is lodged in the bank of england and a considerable amount is placed in french government securities we should prefer going into further details with you personally rather than by letter trusting you will call on us without delay we are sir yours obediently five millions i the starving literary hackthe friendless hopeless almost reckless haunter of low newspaper densi the possessor of over five millions of pounds sterling i tried to grasp the astounding factfor fact it evidently wasbut could not it seemed to me a wild delusion born of the dizzy vagueness which lack of food engendered in my brain i stared round the roomthe mean miserable furniturethe fireless gratethe dirty lampthe low truckle bedsteadthe evidences of penury and want on every sideand thenthen the overwhelming contrast between the poverty that environed me and the news i had just received struck me as the wildest most ridiculous incongruity i had ever heard of or imaginedand i gave vent to a shout of laughter was there ever such a caprice of mad fortune i cried aloudwho would have imagined it good god i i of all men in the world to be suddenly chosen out for this luck by heavenif it is all true ill make society spin round like a top on my hand before i am many months older and i laughed loudly again laughed just as i had previously sworn simply by way of relief to my feelings some one laughed in answera laugh that seemed to echo mine i checked myself abruptly somewhat startled and listened rain poured outside and the wind shrieked like a petulant shrewthe violinist next door was practising a brilliant roulade up and down his instrumentbut there were no other sounds than these yet i could have sworn i heard a mans deepchested laughter close behind me where i stood it must have been my fancy i murmured turning the flame of the lamp up higher in order to obtain more light in the roomi am nervous i supposeno wonder poor bofflesgood old chap i continued remembering my friends draft for fifty pounds which had seemed such a godsend a few minutes sincewhat a surprise is in store for you you shall have your loan back as promptly as you sent it with an extra fifty added by way of interest for your generosity and as for the new mcenas you are sending to help me over my difficultieswell he may be a very excellent old gentleman but he will find himself quite out of his element this time i want neither assistance nor advice nor patronagei can buy them all titles honours possessionsthey are all purchaseablelove friendship positionthey are all for sale in this admirably commercial age and go to the highest bidder by my soulthe wealthy philanthropist will find it difficult to match me in power he will scarcely have more than five millions to waste i warrant and now for supperi shall have to live on credit till i get some ready cashand there is no reason why i should not leave this wretched hole at once and go to one of the best hotels and swagger it i was about to leave the room on the swift impulse of excitement and joy when a fresh and violent gust of wind roared down the chimney bringing with it a shower of soot which fell in a black heap on my rejected manuscript where it lay forgotten on the floor as i had despairingly thrown it i hastily picked it up and shook it free from the noisome dirt wondering as i did so what would be its fate nownow when i could afford to publish it myself and not only publish it but advertise it and not only advertise it but push it in all the crafty and cautious ways known to the inner circles of booming i smiled as i thought of the vengeance i would take on all those who had scorned and slighted me and my labourhow they should cower before mehow they should fawn at my feet like whipt curs and whine their fulsome adulation every stiff and stubborn neck should bend before methis i resolved upon for though money does not always conquer everything it only fails when it is money apart from brains brains and money together can move the worldbrains can very frequently do this alone without money of which serious and proved fact those who have no brains should beware full of ambitious thought i now and then caught wild sounds from the violin that was being played next doornotes like sobbing cries of pain and anon rippling runs like a careless womans laughterand all at once i remembered i had not yet opened the third letter addressed to methe one coroneted in scarlet and gold which had remained where it was on the table almost unnoticed till now i took it up and turned it over with an odd sense of reluctance in my fingers which were slow at the work of tearing the thick envelope asunder drawing out an equally thick small sheet of notepaper also coroneted i read the following lines written in an admirably legible small and picturesque hand dear sir i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to you from your former college companion mr john carrington now of melbourne who has been good enough to thus give me the means of making the acquaintance of one who i understand is more than exceptionally endowed with the gift of literary genius i shall call upon you this evening between eight and nine oclock trusting to find you at home and disengaged i enclose my card and present address and beg to remain very faithfully yours lucio rimnez the card mentioned dropped on the table as i finished reading the note it bore a small exquisitely engraved coronet and the words prince lucio rimnez while scribbled lightly in pencil underneath was the address grand hotel i read the brief letter through againit was simple enoughexpressed with clearness and civility there was nothing remarkable about itnothing whatever yet it seemed to me surcharged with meaning why i could not imagine a curious fascination kept my eyes fastened on the characteristic bold handwriting and made me fancy i should like the man who penned it how the wind roaredand how that violin next door wailed like the restless spirit of some forgotten musician in torment my brain swam and my heart ached heavilythe drip drip of the rain outside sounded like the stealthy footfall of some secret spy upon my movements i grew irritable and nervousa foreboding of evil somehow darkened the bright consciousness of my sudden good fortune then an impulse of shame possessed meshame that this foreign prince if such he were with limitless wealth at his back should be coming to visit meme now a millionairein my present wretched lodging already before i had touched my riches i was tainted by the miserable vulgarity of seeking to pretend i had never been really poor but only embarrassed by a little temporary difficulty if i had had a sixpence about me which i had not i should have sent a telegram to my approaching visitor to put him off but in any case i said aloud addressing myself to the empty room and the stormechoesi will not meet him tonight ill go out and leave no messageand if he comes he will think i have not yet had his letter i can make an appointment to see him when i am better lodged and dressed more in keeping with my present positionin the meantime nothing is easier than to keep out of this wouldbe benefactors way as i spoke the flickering lamp gave a dismal crackle and went out leaving me in pitch darkness with an exclamation more strong than reverent i groped about the room for matches or failing them for my hat and coatand i was still engaged in a fruitless and annoying search when i caught a sound of galloping horses hoofs coming to an abrupt stop in the street below surrounded by </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> by black gloom i paused and listened there was a slight commotion in the basementi heard my landladys accents attuned to nervous civility mingling with the mellow tones of a deep masculine voicethen steps firm and even ascended the stairs to my landing the devil is in it i muttered vexedlyjust like my wayward luckhere comes the very man i meant to avoid iii the door openedand from the dense obscurity enshrouding me i could just perceive a tall shadowy figure standing on the threshold i remember well the curious impression the mere outline of this scarcely discerned form made upon me even thensuggesting at the first glance such a stately majesty of height and bearing as at once riveted my attentionso much so indeed that i scarcely heard my landladys introductory words a gentleman to see you sirwords that were quickly interrupted by a murmur of dismay at finding the room in total darkness well to be sure the lamp must have gone out she exclaimedthen addressing the personage she had ushered thus far she addedim afraid mr tempest isnt in after all sir though i certainly saw him about halfanhour ago if you dont mind waiting here a minute ill fetch a light and see if he has left any message on his table she hurried away and though i knew that of course i ought to speak a singular and quite inexplicable perversity of humour kept me silent and unwilling to declare my presence meanwhile the tall stranger advanced a pace or two and a rich voice with a ring of ironical amusement in it called me by my name geoffrey tempest are you there why could i not answer the strangest and most unnatural obstinacy stiffened my tongueand concealed in the gloom of my forlorn literary den i still held my peace the majestic figure drew nearer till in height and breadth it seemed to suddenly overshadow me and once again the voice called geoffrey tempest are you there for very shames sake i could hold out no longerand with a determined effort i broke the extraordinary dumb spell that had held me like a coward in silent hiding and came forward boldly to confront my visitor yes i am here i saidand being here i am ashamed to give you such a welcome as this you are prince rimnez of coursei have just read your note which prepared me for your visit but i was hoping that my landlady finding the room in darkness would conclude i was out and show you downstairs again you see i am perfectly frank you are indeed returned the stranger his deep tones still vibrating with the silvery clang of veiled satireso frank that i cannot fail to understand you briefly and without courtesy you resent my visit this evening and wish i had not come this open declaration of my mood sounded so brusque that i made haste to deny it though i knew it to be true truth even in trifles always seems unpleasant pray do not think me so churlishi saidthe fact is i only opened your letter a few minutes ago and before i could make any arrangements to receive you the lamp went out with the awkward result that i am forced to greet you in this unsociable darkness which is almost too dense to shake hands in shall we try my visitor enquired with a sudden softening of accent that gave his words a singular charm here is my handif yours has any friendly instinct in it the twain will meetquite blindly and without guidance i at once extended my hand and it was instantly clasped in a warm and somewhat masterful manner at that moment a light flashed on the scenemy landlady entered bearing what she called her best lamp alit and set it on the table i believe she uttered some exclamation of surprise at seeing meshe may have said anything or nothingi did not hear or heed so entirely was i amazed and fascinated by the appearance of the man whose long slender hand still held mine i am myself an average good height but he was fully half a head taller than i if not more than thatand as i looked straightly at him i thought i had never seen so much beauty and intellectuality combined in the outward personality of any human being the finely shaped head denoted both power and wisdom and was nobly poised on such shoulders as might have befitted a herculesthe countenance was a pure oval and singularly pale this complexion intensifying the almost fiery brilliancy of the full dark eyes which had in them a curious and wonderfully attractive look of mingled mirth and misery the mouth was perhaps the most telling feature in this remarkable faceset in the perfect curve of beauty it was yet firm determined and not too small thus escaping effeminacyand i noted that in repose it expressed bitterness disdain and even cruelty but with the light of a smile upon it it signified or seemed to signify something more subtle than any passion to which we can give a name and already with the rapidity of a lightning flash i caught myself wondering what that mystic undeclared something might be at a glance i comprehended these primary details of my new acquaintances eminently prepossessing appearance and when my hand dropped from his close grasp i felt as if i had known him all my life and now face to face with him in the bright lamplight i remembered my actual surroundingsthe bare cold room the lack of fire the black soot that sprinkled the nearly carpetless floormy own shabby clothes and deplorable aspect as compared with this regallooking individual who carried the visible evidence of wealth upon him in the superb russian sables that lined and bordered his long overcoat which he now partially unfastened and threw open with a carelessly imperial air the while he regarded me smiling i know i have come at an awkward moment he saidi always do it is my peculiar misfortune wellbred people never intrude where they are not wantedand in this particular im afraid my manners leave much to be desired try to forgive me if you can for the sake of thisand he held out a letter addressed to me in my friend carringtons familiar handwriting and permit me to sit down while you read my credentials he took a chair and seated himself i observed his handsome face and easy attitude with renewed admiration no credentials are necessary i said with all the cordiality i now really felti have already had a letter from carrington in which he speaks of you in the highest and most grateful terms but the fact iswellreally prince you must excuse me if i seem confused or astonished i had expected to see quite an old man and i broke off somewhat embarrassed by the keen glance of the brilliant eyes that met mine so fixedly no one is old my dear sir nowadays he declared lightlyeven the grandmothers and grandfathers are friskier at fifty than they were at fifteen one does not talk of age at all now in polite societyit is illbred even coarse indecent things are unmentionableage has become an indecent thing it is therefore avoided in conversation you expected to see an old man you say well you are not disappointedi am old in fact you have no idea how very old i am i laughed at this piece of absurdity why you are younger than ii saidor if not you look it ah my looks belie me he returned gailyi am like several of the most noted fashionable beautiesmuch riper than i seem but come read the introductory missive i have brought youi shall not be satisfied till you do thus requested and wishing to prove myself as courteous as i had hitherto been brusque i at once opened my friends note and read as follows dear geoffrey the bearer of this prince rimnez is a very distinguished scholar and gentleman allied by descent to one of the oldest families in europe or for that matter in the world you as a student and lover of ancient history will be interested to know that his ancestors were originally princes of chaldea who afterwards settled in tyrefrom thence they went to etruria and there continued through many centuries the last scion of the house being the very gifted and genial personage who as my good friend i have the pleasure of commending to your kindest regard certain troublous and overpowering circumstances have forced him into exile from his native province and deprived him of a great part of his possessions so that he is to a considerable extent a wanderer on the face of the earth and has travelled far and seen much and has a wide experience of men and things he is a poet and musician of great skill and though he occupies himself with the arts solely for his own amusement i think you will find his practical knowledge of literary matters eminently useful to you in your difficult career i must not forget to add that in all matters scientific he is an absolute master wishing you both a cordial friendship i am dear geoffrey yours sincerely john carrington the signature of boffles had evidently been deemed </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> deemed out of place this time and somehow i was foolishly vexed at its omission there seemed to be something formal and stiff in the letter almost as if it had been written to dictation and under pressure what gave me this idea i know not i glanced furtively at my silent companionhe caught my stray look and returned it with a curiously grave fixity fearing lest my momentary vague distrust of him had been reflected in my eyes i made haste to speak this letter prince adds to my shame and regret that i should have greeted you in so churlish a manner this evening no apology can condone my rudenessbut you cannot imagine how mortified i felt and still feel to be compelled to receive you in this miserable denit is not at all the sort of place in which i should have liked to welcome you and i broke off with a renewed sense of irritation remembering how actually rich i now was and that in spite of this i was obliged to seem poor meanwhile the prince waived aside my remarks with a light gesture of his hand why be mortified he demanded rather be proud that you can dispense with the vulgar appurtenances of luxury genius thrives in a garret and dies in a palaceis not that the generally accepted theory rather a wornout and mistaken one i consideri replied genius might like to try the effect of a palace for onceit usually dies of starvation truebut in thus dying think how many fools it afterwards fattens there is an allwise providence in this my dear sir schubert perished of wantbut see what large profits all the musicpublishers have made since out of his compositions it is a most beautiful dispensation of naturethat honest folk should be sacrificed in order to provide for the sustenance of knaves he laughed and i looked at him in a little surprise his remark touched so near my own opinions that i wondered whether he were in jest or earnest you speak sarcastically of course i saidyou do not really believe what you say oh do i not he returned with a flash of his fine eyes that was almost lightninglike in its intensityif i could not believe the teaching of my own experience what would be left to me i always realize the needs must of thingshow does the old maxim goneeds must when the devil drives there is really no possible contradiction to offer to the accuracy of that statement the devil drives the world whip in handand oddly enough considering that some belated folk still fancy there is a god somewhere succeeds in managing his team with extraordinary ease his brow clouded and the bitter lines about his mouth deepened and hardenedanon he laughed again lightly and continuedbut let us not moralizemorals sicken the soul both in church and out of itevery sensible man hates to be told what he could be and what he wont be i am here to make friends with you if you permitand to put an end to ceremony will you accompany me back to my hotel where i have ordered supper by this time i had become indescribably fascinated by his easy manner handsome presence and mellifluous voicethe satirical turn of his humour suited minei felt we should get on well togetherand my first annoyance at being discovered by him in such povertystricken circumstances somewhat abated with pleasure i repliedbut first of all you must allow me to explain matters a little you have heard a good deal about my affairs from my friend john carrington and i know from his private letter to me that you have come here out of pure kindness and goodwill for that generous intention i thank you i know you expected to find a poor wretch of a literary man struggling with the direst circumstances of disappointment and povertyand a couple of hours ago you would have amply fulfilled that expectation but now things have changedi have received news which completely alters my positionin fact i have had a very great and remarkable surprise this evening an agreeable one i trust interposed my companion suavely i smiled judge for yourself and i handed him the lawyers letter which informed me of my suddenly acquired fortune he glanced it through rapidlythen folded and returned it to me with a courteous bow i suppose i should congratulate youhe saidand i do though of course this wealth which seems to content you to me appears a mere trifle it can be quite conveniently run through and exhausted in about eight years or less therefore it does not provide absolute immunity from care to be rich really rich in my sense of the word one should have about a million a year then one might reasonably hope to escape the workhouse he laughedand i stared at him stupidly not knowing how to take his words whether as truth or idle boasting five millions of money a mere trifle he went on without apparently noticing my amazement the inexhaustible greed of a man my dear sir can never be satisfied if he is not consumed by desire for one thing he is for another and his tastes are generally expensive a few pretty and unscrupulous women for example would soon relieve you of your five millions in the purchase of jewels alone horseracing would do it still more quickly no noyou are not richyou are still pooronly your needs are no longer so pressing as they were and in this i confess myself somewhat disappointedfor i came to you hoping to do a good turn to some one for once in my life and to play the fosterfather to a rising geniusand here i amforestalledas usual it is a singular thing do you know but nevertheless a fact that whenever i have had any particular intentions towards a man i am always forestalled it is really rather hard upon me he broke off and raised his head in a listening attitude what is that he asked it was the violinist next door playing a wellknown ave maria i told him so dismalvery dismal he said with a contemptuous shrug i hate all that kind of mawkish devotional stuff wellmillionaire as you are and acknowledged lion of society as you shortly will be there is no objection i hope to the proposed supper and perhaps a musichall afterwards if you feel inclinedwhat do you say he clapped me on the shoulder cordially and looked straight into my facethose wonderful eyes of his suggestive of both tears and fire fixed me with a clear masterful gaze that completely dominated me i made no attempt to resist the singular attraction which now possessed me for this man whom i had but just metthe sensation was too strong and too pleasant to be combated only for one moment more i hesitated looking down at my shabby attire i am not fit to accompany you prince i saidi look more like a tramp than a millionaire he glanced at me and smiled upon my life so you do he averredbut be satisfiedyou are in this respect very like many another croesus it is only the poor and proud who take the trouble to dress wellthey and the dear naughty ladies generally monopolize tasteful and becoming attire an illfitting coat often adorns the back of a prime ministerand if you see a woman clad in clothes vilely cut and coloured you may be sure she is eminently virtuous renowned for good works and probably a duchess he rose drawing his sables about him what matter the coat if the purse be full he continued gailylet it once be properly paragraphed in the papers that you are a millionaire and doubtless some enterprising tailor will invent a tempest ulster coloured softly like your present garb an artistic mildewy green and now come alongyour solicitors communication should have given you a good appetite or it is not so valuable as it seemsand i want you to do justice to my supper i have my own chef with me and he is not without skill i hope by the way you will at least do me this much servicethat pending legal discussion and settlement of your affairs you will let me be your banker this offer was made with such an air of courteous delicacy and friendship that i could do no more than accept it gratefully as it relieved me from all temporary embarrassment i hastily wrote a few lines to my landlady telling her she would receive the money owing to her by post next daythen thrusting my rejected manuscript my only worldly possession into my coatpocket i extinguished the lamp and with the new friend i had so suddenly gained i left my dismal lodgings and all its miserable associations for ever i little thought the time would come when i should look back to the time spent in that small mean room as the best period of my lifewhen i should regard the bitter poverty i then endured as the stern but holy angel meant to guide me to the highest and noblest attainmentwhen i should pray desperately with wild tears to be as i was then rather than as i am now is it well or ill for us i wonder that the future </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> future is hidden from our knowledge should we steer our ways clearer from evil if we knew its result it is a doubtful questionat anyrate my ignorance for the moment was indeed bliss i went joyfully out of the dreary house where i had lived so long among disappointments and difficulties turning my back upon it with such a sense of relief as could never be expressed in wordsand the last thing i heard as i passed into the street with my companion was a plaintive longdrawn wail of minor melody which seemed to be sent after me like a parting cry by the unknown and invisible player of the violin iv outside the princes carriage waited drawn by two spirited black horses caparisoned in silver magnificent thoroughbreds which pawed the ground and champed their bits impatient of delayat sight of his master the smart footman in attendance threw the door open touching his hat respectfully we stepped in i preceding my companion at his expressed desire and as i sank back among the easy cushions i felt the complacent consciousness of luxury and power to such an extent that it seemed as if i had left my days of adversity already a long way behind me hunger and happiness disputed my sensations between them and i was in that vague lightheaded condition common to long fasting in which nothing seems absolutely tangible or real i knew i should not properly grasp the solid truth of my wonderful good luck till my physical needs were satisfied and i was so to speak once more in a naturally balanced bodily condition at present my brain was in a whirlmy thoughts were all dim and disconnectedand i appeared to myself to be in some whimsical dream from which i should wake up directly the carriage rolled on rubbertyred wheels and made no noise as it wentone could only hear the even rapid trot of the horses byandby i saw in the semidarkness my new friends brilliant dark eyes fixed upon me with a curiously intent expression do you not feel the world already at your feet he queried half playfully half ironicallylike a football waiting to be kicked it is such an absurd world you knowso easily moved wise men in all ages have done their best to make it less ridiculouswith no result inasmuch as it continues to prefer folly to wisdom a football or let us say a shuttlecock among worlds ready to be tossed up anyhow and anywhere provided the battledore be of gold you speak a trifle bitterly princei saidbut no doubt you have had a wide experience among men i have he returned with emphasismy kingdom is a vast one you are a ruling power then i exclaimed with some astonishmentyours is not a title of honour only oh as your rules of aristocracy go it is a mere title of honourhe replied quicklywhen i say that my kingdom is a vast one i mean that i rule wherever men obey the influence of wealth from this point of view am i wrong in calling my kingdom vastis it not almost boundless i perceive you are a cynici saidyet surely you believe that there are some things wealth cannot buyhonour and virtue for example he surveyed me with a whimsical smile i suppose honour and virtue do exist he answeredand when they are existent of course they cannot be bought but my experience has taught me that i can always buy everything the sentiments called honour and virtue by the majority of men are the most shifty things imaginableset sufficient cash down and they become bribery and corruption in the twinkling of an eye curiousvery curious i confess i found a case of unpurchaseable integrity once but only once i may find it again though i consider the chance a very doubtful one now to revert to myself pray do not imagine i am playing the humbug with you or passing myself off under a bogus title i am a bonafide prince believe me and of such descent as none of your oldest families can boastbut my dominions are long since broken up and my former subjects dispersed among all nationsanarchy nihilism disruption and political troubles generally compel me to be rather reticent concerning my affairs money i fortunately have in plentyand with that i pave my way some day when we are better acquainted you shall know more of my private history i have various other names and titles besides that on my cardbut i keep to the simplest of them because most people are such bunglers at the pronunciation of foreign names my intimate friends generally drop my title and call me lucio simply that is your christian name i began not at alli have no christian namehe interrupted swiftly and with angerthere is no such thing as christian in my composition he spoke with such impatience that for a moment i was at a loss for a reply at last indeed i murmured vaguely he burst out laughing indeed that is all you can find to say indeed and again indeed the word christian vexes me there is no such creature alive you are not a christianno one is reallypeople pretend to beand in so damnable an act of feigning are more blasphemous than any fallen fiend now i make no pretences of the kindi have only one faith and that is a profound and awful one he said in thrilling tonesand the worst of it is that it is trueas true as the workings of the universe but of that hereafterit will do to talk of when we feel lowspirited and wish to converse of things grim and ghastlyat present here we are at our destination and the chief consideration of our lives it is the chief consideration of most mens lives must be the excellence or nonexcellence of our food the carriage stopped and we descended at first sight of the black horses and silver trappings the porter of the hotel and two or three other servants rushed out to attend upon us but the prince passed into the hall without noticing any of them and addressed himself to a soberlooking individual in black his own private valet who came forward to meet him with a profound salutation i murmured something about wishing to engage a room for myself in the hotel oh my man will see to that for youhe said lightlythe house is not fullat anyrate all the best rooms are not taken and of course you want one of the best a staring waiter who up to that moment had been noting my shabby clothes with that peculiar air of contempt commonly displayed by insolent menials to those whom they imagine are poor overheard these words and suddenly changing the derisive expression of his foxy face bowed obsequiously as i passed a thrill of disgust ran through me mingled with a certain angry triumphthe hypocritical reflex of this low fellows countenance was i knew a true epitome of what i should find similarly reflected in the manner and attitude of all polite society for there the estimate of worth is no higher than a common servants estimate and is taken solely from the money standardif you are poor and dress shabbily you are thrust aside and ignoredbut if you are rich you may wear shabby clothes as much as you like you are still courted and flattered and invited everywhere though you may be the greatest fool alive or the worst blackguard unhung with vague thoughts such as these flitting over my mind i followed my host to his rooms he occupied nearly a whole wing of the hotel having a large drawingroom diningroom and study en suite fitted up in the most luxurious manner besides bedroom bathroom and dressingroom with other rooms adjoining for his valet and two extra personal attendants the table was laid for supper and glittered with the costliest glass silver and china being furthermore adorned by baskets of the most exquisite fruit and flowers and in a few moments we were seated the princes valet acted as headwaiter and i noticed that now this mans face seen in the full light of the electric lamps seemed very dark and unpleasant even sinister in expressionbut in the performance of his duties he was unexceptionable being quick attentive and deferential so much so that i inwardly reproached myself for taking an instinctive dislike to him his name was amiel and i found myself involuntarily watching his movements they were so noiselesshis very step suggesting the stealthy gliding of a cat or a tiger he was assisted in his work by the two other attendants who served as his subordinates and who were equally active and welltrainedand presently i found myself enjoying the choicest meal i had tasted for many and many a long day flavoured with such wine as connoisseurs might be apt to dream of but never succeed in finding i began to feel perfectly at my ease and talked with freedom and confidence the strong attraction i had for my new friend deepening with every moment i passed in his company will you continue your literary career now you have this little fortune left you he inquired when at the close of supper amiel set the choicest cognac and cigars before us and respectfully withdrewdo </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> withdrewdo you think you will care to go on with it certainly i shalli repliedif only for the fun of the thing you see with money i can force my name into notice whether the public like it or not no newspaper refuses paying advertisements truebut may not inspiration refuse to flow from a full purse and an empty head this remark provoked me not a little do you consider me emptyheaded i asked with some vexation not at present my dear tempest do not let either the tokay we have been drinking or the cognac we are going to drink speak for you in such haste i assure you i do not think you emptyheadedon the contrary your head i believe from what i have heard has been and is full of ideasexcellent ideas original ideas which the world of conventional criticism does not want but whether these ideas will continue to germinate in your brain or whether with the full purse they will cease is now the question great originality and inspiration strange to say seldom endow the millionaire inspiration is supposed to come from abovemoney from below in your case however both originality and inspiration may continue to flourish and bring forth fruiti trust they may it often happens nevertheless that when bags of money fall to the lot of aspiring genius god departs and the devil walks in have you never heard that never i answered smiling well of course the saying is foolish and sounds doubly ridiculous in this age when people believe in neither god nor devil it implies however that one must choose an up or a downgenius is the up money is the down you cannot fly and grovel at the same instant the possession of money is not likely to cause a man to groveli saidit is the one thing necessary to strengthen his soaring powers and lift him to the greatest heights you think so and my host lit his cigar with a grave and preoccupied airthen im afraid you dont know much about what i shall call natural psychics what belongs to the earth tends earthwardssurely you realize that gold most strictly belongs to the earthyou dig it out of the groundyou handle it and dispose of it in solid wedges or barsit is a substantial metal enough genius belongs to nobody knows whereyou cannot dig it up or pass it on or do anything with it except stand and marvelit is a rare visitant and capricious as the wind and generally makes sad havoc among the conventionalities of men it is as i said an upper thing beyond earthly smells and savoursand those who have it always live in unknown high latitudes but money is a perfectly level commoditylevel with the groundwhen you have much of it you come down solidly on your flat soles and down you stay i laughed upon my word you preach very eloquently against wealth i saidyou yourself are unusually richare you sorry for it no i am not sorry because being sorry would be no usehe returnedand i never waste my time but i am telling you the truthgenius and great riches hardly ever pull together now i for exampleyou cannot imagine what great capabilities i had oncea long time agobefore i became my own master and you have them still i am surei averred looking expressively at his noble head and fine eyes the strange subtle smile i had noticed once or twice before lightened his face ah you mean to compliment me he saidyou like my looksmany people do yet after all there is nothing so deceptive as ones outward appearance the reason of this is that as soon as childhood is past we are always pretending to be what we are notand thus with constant practice from our youth up we manage to make our physical frames complete disguises for our actual selves it is really wise and clever of usfor hence each individual is so much fleshwall through which neither friend nor enemy can spy every man is a solitary soul imprisoned in a selfmade denwhen he is quite alone he knows and frequently hates himselfsometimes he even gets afraid of the gaunt and murderous monster he keeps hidden behind his outwardly pleasant bodymask and hastens to forget its frightful existence in drink and debauchery that is what i do occasionallyyou would not think it of me would you never i replied quickly for something in his voice and aspect moved me strangelyyou belie yourself and wrong your own nature he laughed softly perhaps i do he said carelesslythis much you may believe of methat i am no worse than most men now to return to the subject of your literary careeryou have written a book you saywell publish it and see the resultif you only make one hit that is something and there are ways of arranging that the hit shall be made what is your story about i hope it is improper it certainly is noti replied warmlyit is a romance dealing with the noblest forms of life and highest ambitionsi wrote it with the intention of elevating and purifying the thoughts of my readers and wished if i could to comfort those who had suffered loss or sorrow rimnez smiled compassionately ah it wont do he interruptedi assure you it wontit doesnt fit the age it might go down possibly if you could give a firstnight of it as it were to the critics like one of my most intimate friends henry irvinga firstnight combined with an excellent supper and any amount of good drinks going otherwise its no use if it is to succeed by itself it must not attempt to be literatureit must simply be indecent as indecent as you can make it without offending advanced womenthat is giving you a good wide margin put in as much as you can about sexual matters and the bearing of childrenin brief discourse of men and women simply as cattle who exist merely for breeding purposes and your success will be enormous theres not a critic living who wont applaud youtheres not a schoolgirl of fifteen who will not gloat over your pages in the silence of her virginal bedroom such a flash of withering derision darted from his eyes as startled mei could find no words to answer him for the moment and he went on what put it into your head my dear tempest to write a book dealing with as you say the noblest forms of life there are no noble forms of life left on this planetit is all low and commercialman is a pigmy and his aims are pigmy like himself for noble forms of life seek other worldsthere are others then again people dont want their thoughts raised or purified in the novels they read for amusementthey go to church for that and get very bored during the process and why should you wish to comfort folks who out of their own sheer stupidity generally get into trouble they wouldnt comfort youthey would not give you sixpence to save you from starvation my good fellow leave your quixotism behind you with your poverty live your life to yourselfif you do anything for others they will only treat you with the blackest ingratitudeso take my advice and dont sacrifice your own personal interests for any consideration whatever he rose from the table as he spoke and stood with his back to the bright fire smoking his cigar tranquillyand i gazed at his handsome figure and face with just the faintest thrill of pained doubt darkening my admiration if you were not so goodlooking i should call you heartlessi said at lastbut your features are a direct contradiction to your words you have not really that indifference to human nature which you strive to assumeyour whole aspect betokens a generosity of spirit which you cannot conquer if you would besides are you not always trying to do good he smiled always that is i am always at work endeavouring to gratify every mans desire whether that is good of me or bad remains to be proved mens wants are almost illimitablethe only thing none of them ever seem to wish so far as i am concerned is to cut my acquaintance why of course not after once meeting you how could they i said laughing at the absurdity of the suggestion he gave me a whimsical sidelook their desires are not always virtuous he remarked turning to flick off the ash of his cigar into the grate but of course you do not gratify them in their vices i rejoined still laughingthat would be playing the part of a benefactor somewhat too thoroughly ah now i see we shall flounder in the quicksands of theory if we go any furtherhe saidyou forget my dear fellow that nobody can decide as to what is vice or what is virtue these things are chameleonlike and take different colours in different countries abraham had two or three wives and several concubines and he was the very soul of virtue according to sacred lorewhereas my lord tomnoddy in london today has one wife and several concubines and is really very much like abraham in other particulars yet he is considered a very dreadful person who shall decide when doctors disagree lets drop the subject as we </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> we shall never settle it what shall we do with the rest of the evening there is a stoutlimbed shrewd wench at the tivoli dancing her way into the affections of a ricketty little dukeshall we go and watch the admirable contortions with which she is wriggling into a fixed position among the english aristocracy or are you tired and would you prefer a long nights rest to tell the truth i was thoroughly fatigued and mentally as well as physically worn out with the excitements of the daymy head too was heavy with the wine to which i had so long been unaccustomed upon my word i think i would rather go to bed than anything i confessedbut what about my room oh amiel will have attended to that for youwell ask him and he touched the bell his valet instantly appeared have you got a room for mr tempest yes your excellency an apartment in this corridor almost facing your excellencys suite it is not as well furnished as it might be but i have made it as comfortable as i can for the night thanks very much i saidi am greatly obliged to you amiel bowed deferentially thank you sir he retired and i moved to bid my host goodnight he took my proffered hand and held it in his looking at me curiously the while i like you geoffrey tempest he saidand because i like you and because i think there are the makings of something higher than mere earthy brute in you i am going to make you what you may perhaps consider rather a singular proposition it is thisthat if you dont like me say so at once and we will part now before we have time to know anything more of each other and i will endeavour not to cross your path again unless you seek me out but if on the contrary you do like meif you find something in my humour or turn of mind congenial to your own disposition give me your promise that you will be my friend and comrade for a while say for a few months at any rate i can take you into the best society and introduce you to the prettiest women in europe as well as the most brilliant men i know them all and i believe i can be useful to you but if there is the smallest aversion to me lurking in the depths of your naturehere he pausedthen resumed with extraordinary solemnityin gods name give it full way and let me gobecause i swear to you in all sober earnest that i am not what i seem strongly impressed by his strange look and stranger manner i hesitated one momentand on that moment had i but known it hung my future it was truei had felt a passing shadow of distrust and repulsion for this fascinating yet cynical man and he seemed to have guessed it but now every suspicion of him vanished from my mind and i clasped his hand with renewed heartiness my dear fellow your warning comes too late i said mirthfullywhatever you are or whatever you choose to think you are i find you most sympathetic to my disposition and i consider myself most fortunate in knowing you my old friend carrington has indeed done me a good turn in bringing us together and i assure you i shall be proud of your companionship you seem to take a perverse delight in running yourself downbut you know the old adage the devil is not so black as he is painted and that is true he murmured dreamilypoor devil his faults are no doubt much exaggerated by the clergy and so we are to be friends i hope so i shall not be the first to break the compact his dark eyes rested upon me thoughtfully yet there seemed to be a lurking smile in them as well compact is a good wordhe saidsoa compact we will consider it i meant to improve your material fortunesyou can dispense with that aid now but i think i can still be of service in pushing you on in society and loveof course you will fall in love if you have not already done sohave you not i i answered quickly and with truthi have seen no woman yet who perfectly fulfils my notions of beauty he burst out laughing violently upon my word you are not wanting in audacity he saidnothing but perfect beauty will suit you eh but consider my friend you though a goodlooking wellbuilt man are not yourself quite a phoebus apollo that has nothing to do with the matteri rejoineda man should choose a wife with a careful eye to his own personal gratification in the same way that he chooses horses or wineperfection or nothing and the womanrimnez demanded his eyes twinkling the woman has really no right of choicei respondedfor this was my pet argument and i took pleasure in setting it forthshe must mate wherever she has the chance of being properly maintained a man is always a mana woman is only a mans appendage and without beauty she cannot put forth any just claim to his admiration or his support rightvery right and logically arguedhe exclaimed becoming preternaturally serious in a momenti myself have no sympathy with the new ideas that are in vogue concerning the intellectuality of woman she is simply the female of manshe has no real soul save that which is a reflex of his and being destitute of logic she is incapable of forming a correct opinion on any subject all the imposture of religion is kept up by this unmathematical hysterical creatureand it is curious considering how inferior a being she is what mischief she has contrived to make in the world upsetting the plans of the wisest kings and counsellors who as mere men should undoubtedly have mastered her and in the present age she is becoming more than ever unmanageable it is only a passing phasei returned carelesslya fad got up by a few unloved and unlovable types of the feminine sex i care very little for womeni doubt whether i shall ever marry well you have plenty of time to consider and amuse yourself with the fair ones en passanthe said watching me narrowlyand in the meantime i can take you round the different marriagemarkets of the world if you choose though the largest one of them all is of course this very metropolis splendid bargains to be had my dear friendwonderful blonde and brunette specimens going really very cheap well examine them at our leisure im glad you have yourself decided that we are to be comradesfor i am proudi may say damnably proudand never stay in any mans company when he expresses the slightest wish to be rid of me goodnight goodnight i responded we clasped hands again and they were still interlocked when a sudden flash of lightning blazed vividly across the room followed instantaneously by a terrific clap of thunder the electric lights went out and only the glow of the fire illumined our faces i was a little startled and confusedthe prince stood still quite unconcerned his eyes shining like those of a cat in the darkness what a storm he remarked lightlysuch thunder in winter is rather unusual amiel the valet entered his sinister countenance resembling a white mask made visible in the gloom these lamps have gone outsaid his masterits very odd that civilized humanity has not yet learned the complete management of the electric light can you put them in order amiel yes your excellency and in a few moments by some dexterous manipulation which i did not understand and could not see the crystalcased jets shone forth again with renewed brilliancy another peal of thunder crashed overhead followed by a downpour of rain really remarkable weather for januarysaid rimnez again giving me his handgoodnight my friend sleep well if the anger of the elements will permit i returned smiling oh never mind the elements man has nearly mastered them or soon will do so now that he is getting gradually convinced there is no deity to interfere in his business amiel show mr tempest to his room amiel obeyed and crossing the corridor ushered me into a large luxurious apartment richly furnished and lit up by the blaze of a bright fire the comforting warmth shone welcome upon me as i entered and i who had not experienced such personal luxury since my boyhoods days felt more than ever overpowered by the jubilant sense of my sudden extraordinary good fortune amiel waited respectfully now and then furtively glancing at me with an expression which to my fancy had something derisive in it is there anything i can do for you sir he inquired no thank youi answered endeavouring to throw an accent of careless condescension into my voicefor somehow i felt this man must be kept strictly in his placeyou have been very attentivei shall not forget it a slight smile flickered over his features much obliged to you sir goodnight and he retired leaving me alone i paced the room up and down more dreamily than consciously trying to thinktrying to set in order the amazing events of the day but my brain was still dazed and confused and the only image of actual prominence </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> prominence in my mind was the striking and remarkable personality of my new friend rimnez his extraordinary good looks his attractive manner his curious cynicism which was so oddly mixed with some deeper sentiment to which i could not give a name all the trifling yet uncommon peculiarities of his bearing and humour haunted me and became indissolubly mingled as it were with myself and all the circumstances concerning me i undressed before the fire listening drowsily to the rain and the thunder which was now dying off into sullen echoes geoffrey tempest the world is before you i said apostrophizing myself indolentlyyou are a young manyou have health a good appearance and brainsadded to these you now have five millions of money and a wealthy prince for your friend what more do you want of fate or fortune nothingexcept fame and that you will get easily for nowadays even fame is purchaseablelike love your star is in the ascendantno more literary drudgery for you my boypleasure and profit and ease are yours to enjoy for the rest of your life you are a lucky dogat last you have your day i flung myself upon the soft bed and settled myself to sleepand as i dozed off i still heard the rumble of heavy thunder in the distance once i fancied i heard the princes voice calling amiel amiel with a wildness resembling the shriek of an angry windand at another moment i started violently from a profound slumber under the impression that someone had approached and was looking fixedly at me i sat up in bed peering into the darkness for the fire had gone outthen i turned on a small electric nightlamp at my side which fully illumined the roomthere was no one there yet my imagination played me such tricks before i could rest again that i thought i heard a hissing whisper near me that said peace trouble him not let the fool in his folly sleep v the next morning on rising i learned that his excellency as prince rimnez was called by his own servants and the employs of the grand had gone out riding in the park leaving me to breakfast alone i therefore took that meal in the public room of the hotel where i was waited upon with the utmost obsequiousness in spite of my shabby clothes which i was of course still compelled to wear having no change when would i be pleased to lunch at what hour would i dine should my present apartment be retainedor was it not satisfactory would i prefer a suite similar to that occupied by his excellency all these deferential questions first astonished and then amused mesome mysterious agency had evidently conveyed the rumour of my wealth among those best fitted to receive it and here was the first result in reply i said my movements were uncertaini should be able to give definite instructions in the course of a few hours and that in the meantime i retained my room the breakfast over i sallied forth to go to my lawyers and was just about to order a hansom when i saw my new friend coming back from his ride he bestrode a magnificent chestnut mare whose wild eyes and strained quivering limbs showed she was fresh from a hard gallop and was scarcely yet satisfied to be under close control she curveted and danced among the carts and cabs in a somewhat risky fashion but she had her master in rimnez who if he had looked handsome by night looked still more so by day with a slight colour warming the natural pallor of his complexion and his eyes sparkling with all the zest of exercise and enjoyment i waited for his approach as did also amiel who as usual timed his appearance in the hotel corridor in exact accordance with the moment of his masters arrival rimnez smiled as he caught sight of me touching his hat with the handle of his whip by way of salutation you slept late tempesthe said as he dismounted and threw the reins to a groom who had cantered up after himtomorrow you must come with me and join what they call in fashionable slang parlance the liver brigade once upon a time it was considered the height of indelicacy and low breeding to mention the liver or any other portion of ones internal machinerybut we have done with all that now and we find a peculiar satisfaction in discoursing of disease and unsavoury medical matters generally and in the liver brigade you see at a glance all those interesting fellows who have sold themselves to the devil for the sake of the fleshpots of egyptmen who eat till they are wellnigh bursting and then prance up and down on good horsesmuch too respectable beasts by the way to bear such bestial burdensin the hope of getting out of their poisoned blood the evil they have themselves put in they think me one of them but i am not he patted his mare and the groom led her away the foam of her hard ride still flecking her glossy chest and forelegs why do you join the procession then i asked him laughing and glancing at him with undisguised approval as i spoke for he seemed more admirably built than ever in his wellfitting riding gearyou are a fraud i am he responded lightlyand do you know i am not the only one in london where are you off to to those lawyers who wrote to me last nightbentham and ellis is the name of the firm the sooner i interview them the betterdont you think so yesbut see hereand he drew me asideyou must have some ready cash it doesnt look well to apply at once for advancesand there is really no necessity to explain to these legal men that you were on the verge of starvation when their letter arrived take this pocketbookremember you promised to let me be your bankerand on your way you might go to some wellreputed tailor and get properly rigged out tata he moved off at a rapid pacei hurried after him touched to the quick by his kindness but waiti saylucio and i called him thus by his familiar name for the first time he stopped at once and stood quite still well he said regarding me with an attentive smile you dont give me time to speaki answered in a low voice for we were standing in one of the public corridors of the hotelthe fact is i have some money or rather i can get it directlycarrington sent me a draft for fifty pounds in his letteri forgot to tell you about it it was very good of him to lend it to meyou had better have it as security for this pocketbookbythebye how much is there inside it five hundred in bank notes of tens and twentieshe responded with businesslike brevity five hundred my dear fellow i dont want all that its too much better have too much than too little nowadayshe retorted with a laughmy dear tempest dont make such a business of it five hundred pounds is really nothing you can spend it all on a dressingcase for example better send back john carringtons drafti dont think much of his generosity considering that he came into a mine worth a hundred thousand pounds sterling a few days before i left australia i heard this with great surprise and i must admit with a slight feeling of resentment too the frank and generous character of my old chum boffles seemed to darken suddenly in my eyeswhy could he not have told me of his good fortune in his letter was he afraid i might trouble him for further loans i suppose my looks expressed my thoughts for rimnez who had observed me intently presently added did he not tell you of his luck that was not very friendly of himbut as i remarked last night money often spoils a man oh i daresay he meant no slight by the omission i said hurriedly forcing a smileno doubt he will make it the subject of his next letter now as to this five hundred keep it man keep ithe interposed impatientlywhat do you talk about security for havent i got you as security i laughed well i am fairly reliable nowi saidand im not going to run away from me he queried with a half cold half kind glance noi fancy not he waved his hand lightly and left me and i putting the leather case of notes in my inner breastpocket hailed a hansom and was driven off rapidly to basinghall street where my solicitors awaited me arrived at my destination i sent up my name and was received at once with the utmost respect by two small chips of men in rusty black who represented the firm at my request they sent down their clerk to pay and dismiss my cab while i opening lucios pocket book asked them to change me a tenpound note into gold and silver which they did with ready goodwill then we went into business together my deceased relative whom i had never seen as far as i myself remembered but who had seen me as a motherless baby in my nurses arms had left me everything he </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> he possessed unconditionally including several rare collections of pictures jewels and curios his will was so concisely and clearly worded that there were no possibilities of any legal hairsplitting over itand i was informed that in a week or ten days at the utmost everything would be in order and at my sole disposition you are a very fortunate man mr tempestsaid the senior partner mr bentham as he folded up the last of the papers we had been looking through and put it byat your age this princely inheritance may be either a great boon to you or a great curseone never knows the possession of such enormous wealth involves great responsibilities i was amused at what i considered the impertinence of this mere servant of the law in presuming to moralize on my luck many people would be glad to accept such responsibilities and change places with mei said with a flippant airyou yourself for example i knew this remark was not in good taste but i made it wilfully feeling that he had no business to preach to me as it were on the responsibilities of wealth he took no offence howeverhe merely gave me an observant sideglance like that of some meditative crow no mr tempest nohe said drilyi do not think i should at all be disposed to change places with you i feel very well satisfied as i am my brain is my bank and brings me in quite sufficient interest to live upon which is all that i desire to be comfortable and pay ones way honestly is enough for me i have never envied the wealthy mr bentham is a philosopherinterposed his partner mr ellis smilingin our profession mr tempest we see so many ups and downs of life that in watching the variable fortunes of our clients we ourselves learn the lesson of content ah it is a lesson that i have never mastered till now i responded merrilybut at the present moment i confess myself satisfied they each gave me a formal little bow and mr bentham shook hands business being concluded allow me to congratulate you he said politelyof course if you should wish at any time to entrust your legal affairs to other hands my partner and myself are perfectly willing to withdraw your deceased relative had the highest confidence in us as i have also i assure youi interrupted quicklypray do me the favour to continue managing things for me as you did for my relative and be assured of my gratitude in advance both little men bowed again and this time mr ellis shook hands we shall do our best for you mr tempest shall we not bentham bentham nodded gravely and now what do you sayshall we mention it benthamor shall we not mention it perhaps responded bentham sententiouslyit would be as well to mention it i glanced from one to the other not understanding what they meant mr ellis rubbed his hands and smiled deprecatingly the fact is mr tempest your deceased relative had one very curious ideahe was a shrewd man and a clever one but he certainly had one very curious ideaand perhaps if he had followed it up to any extent it mightyes it might have landed him in a lunatic asylum and prevented his disposing of his extensive fortune in theerthe very just and reasonable manner he has done happily for himself anderfor you he did not follow it up and to the last he retained his admirable business qualities and high sense of rectitude but i do not think he ever quite dispossessed himself of the idea itself did he bentham bentham gazed meditatively at the round black mark of the gasburner where it darkened the ceiling i think notno i think not he answeredi believe he was perfectly convinced of it and what was it i asked getting impatientdid he want to bring out some patenta new notion for a flyingmachine and get rid of his money in that way no no no and mr ellis laughed a soft pleasant little laugh over my suggestionno my dear sirnothing of a purely mechanical or commercial turn captivated his imagination he was tooeryes i think i may say too profoundly opposed to what is called progress in the world to aid it by any new invention or other means whatever you see it is a little awkward for me to explain to you what really seems to be the most absurd and fantastic notionbutto begin with we never really knew how he made his money did we bentham bentham shook his head and pursed his lips closely together we had to take charge of large sums and advise as to investments and other mattersbut it was not our business to inquire where the cash came from in the first place was it bentham again bentham shook his head solemnly we were entrusted with itwent on his partner pressing the tips of his fingers together caressingly as he spokeand we did our best to fulfil that trustwitherwith discretion and fidelity and it was only after we had been for many years connected in business that our client mentionederhis ideaa most erratic and extraordinary one which was briefly thisthat he had sold himself to the devil and that his large fortune was one result of the bargain i burst out laughing heartily what a ridiculous notion i exclaimedpoor mana weak spot in his brain somewhere evidentlyor perhaps he used the expression as a mere figure of speech i think notresponded mr ellis half interrogatively still caressing his fingersi think our client did not use the phrase sold to the devil as a figure of speech merely mr bentham i am positive he did notsaid bentham seriouslyhe spoke of the bargain as an actual and accomplished fact i laughed again with a trifle less boisterousness well people have all sorts of fancies nowadaysi said what with blavatskyism besantism and hypnotism it is no wonder if some folks still have a faint credence in the silly old superstition of a devils existence but for a thoroughly sensible man yeser yesinterrupted mr ellisyour relative mr tempest was a thoroughly sensible man and thiserthis idea was the only fancy that ever appeared to have taken root in his eminently practical mind being only an idea it seemed hardly worth mentioningbut perhaps it is wellmr bentham agreeing with methat we have mentioned it it is a satisfaction and relief to ourselvessaid mr bentham to have had it mentioned i smiled and thanking them rose to go they bowed to me once more simultaneously looking almost like twin brothers so identically had their united practice of the law impressed itself upon their features goodday mr tempestsaid mr benthami need scarcely say that we shall serve you as we served our late client to the best of our ability and in matters where advice may be pleasant or profitable we may possibly be of use to you may we ask whether you require any cash advances immediately no thank youi answered feeling grateful to my friend rimnez for having placed me in a perfectly independent position to confront these solicitorsi am amply provided they seemed i fancied a trifle surprised at this but were too discreet to offer any remark they wrote down my address at the grand hotel and sent their clerk to show me to the door i gave this man halfasovereign to drink my health which he very cheerfully promised to dothen i walked round by the law courts trying to realize that i was not in a dizzy dream but that i was actually and solidly five times a millionaire as luck would have it in turning a corner i jostled up against a man coming the other way the very publisher who had returned me my rejected manuscript the day before hullo he exclaimed stopping short hullo i rejoined where are you off to he went ongoing to try and place that unlucky novel my dear boy believe me it will never do as it is it will do it shall doi said calmlyi am going to publish it myself he started publish it yourself good heavensit will cost youahsixty or seventy perhaps a hundred pounds i dont care if it costs me a thousand a red flush came into his face and his eyes opened in astonishment i thought excuse me he stammered awkwardly i thought money was scarce with you it was i answered drilyit isnt now then his utterly bewildered look together with the whole topsyturviness of things in my altered position struck me so forcibly that i burst out laughing wildly and with a prolonged noise and violence that apparently alarmed him for he began looking nervously about him in all directions as if meditating flight i caught him by the arm look here man i said trying to conquer my almost hysterical mirthim not maddont you think itim only amillionaire and i began laughing again the situation seemed to me so sublimely ridiculous but the worthy publisher did not see it at alland his features expressed so much genuine alarm that i made a further effort to control myself and succeeded i assure you on my word of honour im not jokingits a fact last night i wanted a dinner and you like a good fellow offered to give me </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> me onetoday i possess five millions of money dont stare so dont have a fit of apoplexy and as i have told you i shall publish my book myself at my own expense and it shall succeed oh im in earnest grim earnest grim as deathive more than enough in my pocketbook to pay for its publication now i loosed my hold of him and he fell back stupefied and confused god bless my soul he muttered feeblyits like a dreami was never more astonished in my life nor i i said another temptation to laughter threatening my composurebut strange things happen in life as in fiction and that book which the buildersi mean the readersrejected shall be the headstone of the cornerorthe success of the season what will you take to bring it out take i i bring it out yes youwhy not if i offer you a chance to turn an honest penny shall your paid pack of readers prevent your accepting it fie you are not a slavethis is a free country i know the kind of people who read for youthe gaunt unlovable spinster of fiftythe dyspeptic bookworm who is a literary failure and can find nothing else to do but scrawl growling comments on the manuscript of promising workwhy in heavens name should you rely on such incompetent opinion ill pay you for the publication of my book at as stiff a price as you choose and something over for goodwill and i guarantee you another thingit shall not only make my name as an author but yours as a publisher ill advertise royally and ill work the press everything in this world can be done for money stop stophe interruptedthis is so sudden you must let me think of ityou must give me time to consider take a day for your meditations then i saidbut no longer for if you dont say yes ill get another man and hell have the big pickings instead of you be wise in time my friendgoodday he ran after me staylook here youre so strange so wildso erratic you know your head seems quite turned it is the right way round this time dear dear me and he smiled benevolentlywhy you dont give me a chance to congratulate you i really do you knowi congratulate you sincerely and he shook me by the hand quite fervently and as regards the book i believe there was really no fault found with it in the matter of literary style or qualityit was simply tootoo transcendental and unlikely therefore to suit the public taste the domesticiniquity line is what we find pays best at present but i will think about itwhere will a letter find you grand hotel i responded inwardly amused at his puzzled and anxious expressioni knew he was already mentally calculating how much he could make out of me in the pursuit of my literary whimcome there and lunch or dine with me tomorrow if you likeonly send me a word beforehand remember i give you just a days grace to decideit must be yes or no in twentyfour hours and with this i left him staring vaguely after me like a man who has seen some nameless wonder drop out of the sky at his feet i went on laughing to myself inaudibly till i saw one or two passersby looking at me so surprisedly that i came to the conclusion that i must put a disguise on my thoughts if i would not be taken for a madman i walked briskly and presently my excitement cooled down i resumed the normal condition of the phlegmatic englishman who considers it the height of bad form to display any personal emotion whatever and i occupied the rest of the morning in purchasing some readymade apparel which by unusual good luck happened to fit me and also in giving an extensive not to say extravagant order to a fashionable tailor in sackville street who promised me everything with punctuality and despatch i next sent off the rent i owed to the landlady of my former lodgings adding five pounds extra by way of recognition of the poor womans long patience in giving me credit and general kindness towards me during my stay in her dismal houseand this done i returned to the grand in high spirits looking and feeling very much the better for my readymade outfit a waiter met me in the corridor and with the most obsequious deference informed me that his excellency the prince was waiting luncheon for me in his own apartments thither i repaired at once and found my new friend alone in his sumptuous drawingroom standing near the full light of the largest window and holding in his hand an oblong crystal case through which he was looking with an almost affectionate solicitude ah geoffrey here you are he exclaimedi imagined you would get through your business by lunch time so i waited very good of you i said pleased at the friendly familiarity he displayed in thus calling me by my christian namewhat have you got there a pet of minehe answered smiling slightlydid you ever see anything like it before vi i approached and examined the box he held it was perforated with finely drilled holes for the admission of air and within it lay a brilliant winged insect coloured with all the tints and halftints of the rainbow is it alive i asked it is alive and has a sufficient share of intelligencereplied rimnez i feed it and it knows methat is the utmost you can say of the most civilized human beings they know what feeds them it is quite tame and friendly as you perceiveand opening the case he gently advanced his forefinger the glittering beetles body palpitated with the hues of an opal its radiant wings expanded and it rose at once to its protectors hand and clung there he lifted it out and held it aloft then shaking it to and fro lightly he exclaimed off sprite fly and return to me the creature soared away through the room and round and round the ceiling looking like a beautiful iridescent jewel the whirr of its wings making a faint buzzing sound as it flew i watched it fascinated till after a few graceful movements hither and thither it returned to its owners still outstretched hand and again settled there making no further attempt to fly there is a wellworn platitude which declares that in the midst of life we are in deathsaid the prince then softly bending his dark deep eyes on the insects quivering wingsbut as a matter of fact that maxim is wrong as so many trite human maxims are it should be in the midst of death we are in life this creature is a rare and curious production of death but not i believe the only one of its kind others have been found under precisely similar circumstances i took possession of this one myself in rather a weird fashionwill the story bore you on the contraryi rejoined eagerly my eyes fixed on the radiant batshaped thing that glittered in the light as though its veins were phosphorescent he paused a moment watching me wellit happened simply thusi was present at the uncasing of an egyptian female mummyher talismans described her as a princess of a famous royal house several curious jewels were tied round her neck and on her chest was a piece of beaten gold quarter of an inch thick underneath this gold plate her body was swathed round and round in an unusual number of scented wrappings and when these were removed it was discovered that the mummified flesh between her breasts had decayed away and in the hollow or nest thus formed by the process of decomposition this insect i hold was found alive as brilliant in colour as it is now i could not repress a slight nervous shudder horrible i saidi confess if i were you i should not care to make a pet of such an uncanny object i should kill it i think he kept his bright intent gaze upon me why he asked im afraid my dear geoffrey you are not disposed to study science to kill the poor thing who managed to find life in the very bosom of death is a cruel suggestion is it not to me this unclassified insect is a valuable proof if i needed one of the indestructibility of the germs of conscious existence it has eyes and the senses of taste smell touch and hearingand it gained these together with its intelligence out of the dead flesh of a woman who lived and no doubt loved and sinned and suffered more than four thousand years ago he broke offthen suddenly addedall the same i frankly admit to you that i believe it to be an evil creature i do indeed but i like it none the less for that in fact i have rather a fantastic notion about it myself i am much inclined to accept the idea of the transmigration of souls and so i please my humour sometimes by thinking that perhaps the princess of that royal egyptian house had a wicked brilliant vampire souland that here it is a cold thrill ran through me from head to foot at these words and as i </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> i looked at the speaker standing opposite me in the wintry light dark and tall with the wicked brilliant vampire soul clinging to his hand there seemed to me to be a sudden hideousness declared in his excessive personal beauty i was conscious of a vague terror but i attributed it to the gruesome nature of the story and determining to combat my sensations i examined the weird insect more closely as i did so its bright beady eyes sparkled i thought vindictively and i stepped back vexed with myself at the foolish fear of the thing which overpowered me it is certainly remarkablei murmuredno wonder you value itas a curiosity its eyes are quite distinct almost intelligent in fact no doubt she had beautiful eyessaid rimnez smiling she whom do you mean the princess of course he answered evidently amused the dear dead ladysome of whose personality must be in this creature seeing that it had nothing but her body to nourish itself upon and here he replaced the creature in its crystal habitation with the utmost care i supposei said slowly you in your pursuit of science would infer from this that nothing actually perishes completely exactly returned rimnez emphatically there my dear tempest is the mischiefor the deityof things nothing can be entirely annihilatednot even a thought i was silent watching him while he put the glass case with its uncanny occupant away out of sight and now for luncheon he said gaily passing his arm through mineyou look twenty per cent better than when you went out this morning geoffrey so i conclude your legal matters are disposed of satisfactorily and what else have you done with yourself seated at table with the darkfaced amiel in attendance i related my mornings adventures dwelling at length on my chance meeting with the publisher who had on the previous day refused my manuscript and who now i felt sure would be only too glad to close with the offer i had made him rimnez listened attentively smiling now and then of course he said when i had concluded there is nothing in the least surprising in the conduct of the worthy man in fact i think he showed remarkable discretion and decency in not at once jumping at your propositionhis pleasant hypocrisy in retiring to think it over shows him to be a person of tact and foresight did you ever imagine that a human being or a human conscience existed that could not be bought my good fellow you can buy a king if you only give a long price enough and the pope will sell you a specially reserved seat in his heaven if you will only hand him the cash down while he is on earth nothing is given free in this world save the air and the sunshineeverything else must be boughtwith blood tears and groans occasionallybut oftenest with money i fancied that amiel behind his masters chair smiled darkly at thisand my instinctive dislike of the fellow kept me more or less reticent concerning my affairs till the luncheon was over i could not formulate to myself any substantial reason for my aversion to this confidential servant of the princesbut do what i would the aversion remained and increased each time i saw his sullen and as i thought sneering features yet he was perfectly respectful and deferential i could find no actual fault with himnevertheless when at last he placed the coffee cognac and cigars on the table and noiselessly withdrew i was conscious of a great relief and breathed more freely as soon as we were alone rimnez lit a cigar and settled himself for a smoke looking over at me with a personal interest and kindness which made his handsome face more than ever attractive now let us talkhe saidi believe i am at present the best friend you have and i certainly know the world better than you do what do you propose to make of your life or in other words how do you mean to begin spending your money i laughed well i shant provide funds for the building of a church or the endowment of a hospitali saidi shall not even start a free library for these institutions besides becoming centres for infectious diseases generally get presided over by a committee of local grocers who presume to consider themselves judges of literature my dear prince rimnez i mean to spend my money on my own pleasure and i daresay i shall find plenty of ways to do it rimnez fanned away the smoke of his cigar with one hand and his dark eyes shone with a peculiarly vivid light through the pale grey floating haze with your fortune you could make hundreds of miserable people happyhe suggested thanks i would rather be happy myself firsti answered gailyi daresay i seem to you selfishyou are philanthropic i know i am not he still regarded me steadily you might help your fellowworkers in literature i interrupted him with a decided gesture that i will never do my friend though the heavens should crack my fellowworkers in literature have kicked me down at every opportunity and done their best to keep me from earning a bare livelihoodit is my turn at kicking now and i will show them as little mercy as little help as little sympathy as they have shown me revenge is sweet he quoted sententiouslyi should recommend your starting a highclass halfcrown magazine why can you ask just think of the ferocious satisfaction it would give you to receive the manuscripts of your literary enemies and reject them to throw their letters into the wastepaper basket and send back their poems stories political articles and what not with returned with thanks or not up to our mark typewritten on the backs thereof to dig knives into your rivals through the medium of anonymous criticism the howling joy of a savage with twenty scalps at his belt would be tame in comparison to it i was an editor once myself and i know i laughed at his whimsical earnestness i daresay you are righti saidi can grasp the vengeful position thoroughly but the management of a magazine would be too much trouble to metoo much of a tie dont manage it follow the example of all the big editors and live out of the business altogetherbut take the profits you never see the real editor of a leading daily newspaper you knowyou can only interview the sub the real man is according to the seasons of the year at ascot in scotland at newmarket or wintering in egypthe is supposed to be responsible for everything in his journal but he is generally the last person who knows anything about it he relies on his staffa very bad crutch at timesand when his staff are in a difficulty they get out of it by saying they are unable to decide without the editor meanwhile the editor is miles away comfortably free from worry you could bamboozle the public in that way if you liked i could but i shouldnt care to do so i answeredif i had a business i would not neglect it i believe in doing things thoroughly so do i responded rimnez promptly i am a very thoroughgoing fellow myself and whatever my hand findeth to do i do it with my mightexcuse me for quoting scripture he smiled a little ironically i thought then resumedwell in what at present does your idea of enjoying your heritage consist in publishing my book i answered that very book i could get no one to accepti tell you i will make it the talk of london possibly you willhe said looking at me through halfclosed eyes and a cloud of smokelondon easily talks particularly on unsavoury and questionable subjects thereforeas i have already hintedif your book were a judicious mixture of zola huysmans and baudelaire or had for its heroine a modest maid who considered honourable marriage a degradation it would be quite sure of success in these days of new sodom and gomorrah here he suddenly sprang up and flinging away his cigar confronted me why do not the heavens rain fire on this accursed city it is ripe for punishmentfull of abhorrent creatures not worth the torturing in hell to which it is said liars and hypocrites are condemned tempest if there is one human being more than another that i utterly abhor it is the type of man so common to the present time the man who huddles his own loathly vices under a cloak of assumed broadmindedness and virtue such an one will even deify the loss of chastity in woman by the name of puritybecause he knows that it is by her moral and physical ruin alone that he can gratify his brutal lusts rather than be such a sanctimonious coward i would openly proclaim myself vile that is because yours is a noble naturei saidyou are an exception to the rule an exception iand he laughed bitterlyyes you are right i am an exception among men perhapsbut i am one with the beasts in honesty the lion does not assume the manners of the dovehe loudly announces his own ferocity the very cobra stealthy though its movements be evinces its meaning by a warning hiss or rattle the hungry wolfs bay is </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> is heard far down the wind intimidating the hurrying traveller among the wastes of snow but man gives no clue to his intentmore malignant than the lion more treacherous than the snake more greedy than the wolf he takes his fellowmans hand in pretended friendship and an hour later defames his character behind his backwith a smiling face he hides a false and selfish heartflinging his pigmy mockery at the riddle of the universe he stands gibing at god feebly astraddle on his own earthgraveheavenshere he stopped short with a passionate gesturewhat should the eternities do with such a thankless blind worm as he his voice rang out with singular emphasishis eyes glowed with a fiery ardour startled by his impressive manner i let my cigar die out and stared at him in mute amazement what an inspired countenancewhat an imposing figurehow sovereignly supreme and almost godlike in his looks he seemed at the momentand yet there was something terrifying in his attitude of protest and defiance he caught my wondering glancethe glow of passion faded from his facehe laughed and shrugged his shoulders i think i was born to be an actorhe said carelesslynow and then the love of declamation masters me then i speakas prime ministers and men in parliament speakto suit the humour of the hour and without meaning a single word i say i cannot accept that statementi answered him smiling a littleyou do mean what you saythough i fancy you are rather a creature of impulse do you really he exclaimedhow wise of yougood geoffrey tempest how very wise of you but you are wrong there never was a being created who was less impulsive or more charged with set purpose than i believe me or not as you likebelief is a sentiment that cannot be forced if i told you that i am a dangerous companionthat i like evil things better than goodthat i am not a safe guide for any man what would you think i should think you were whimsically fond of underestimating your own qualitiesi said relighting my cigar and feeling somewhat amused by his earnestnessand i should like you just as well as i do nowperhaps betterthough that would be difficult at these words he seated himself bending his stedfast dark eyes full upon me tempest you follow the fashion of the prettiest women about townthey always like the greatest scoundrels but you are not a scoundreli rejoined smoking peacefully noim not a scoundrel but theres a good deal of the devil in me all the better i said stretching myself out in my chair with lazy comforti hope theres something of him in me too do you believe in him asked rimnez smiling the devil of course not he is a very fascinating legendary personagecontinued the prince lighting another cigar and beginning to puff at it slowlyand he is the subject of many a fine story picture his fall from heavenlucifer son of the morningwhat a title and what a birthright to be born of the morning implies to be a creature formed of translucent light undefiled with all the warm rose of a million orbs of day colouring his bright essence and all the lustre of fiery planets flaming in his eyes splendid and supreme at the right hand of deity itself he stood this majestic archangel and before his unwearied vision rolled the grandest creative splendours of gods thoughts and dreams all at once he perceived in the vista of embryonic things a new small world and on it a being forming itself slowly as it were into the angelic likenessa being weak yet strong sublime yet foolisha strange paradox destined to work its way through all the phases of life till imbibing the very breath and soul of the creator it should touch conscious immortalityeternal joy then lucifer full of wrath turned on the master of the spheres and flung forth his reckless defiance crying aloudwilt thou make of this slight poor creature an angel even as i i do protest against thee and condemn lo if thou makest man in our image i will destroy him utterly as unfit to share with me the splendours of thy wisdomthe glory of thy love and the voice supreme in accents terrible and beautiful replied lucifer son of the morning full well dost thou know that never can an idle or wasted word be spoken before me for freewill is the gift of the immortals therefore what thou sayest thou must needs do fall proud spirit from thy high estatethou and thy companions with theeand return no more till man himself redeem thee each human soul that yields unto thy tempting shall be a new barrier set between thee and heaven each one that of its own choice doth repel and overcome thee shall lift thee nearer thy lost home when the world rejects thee i will pardon and again receive theebut not till then i never heard exactly that version of the legend beforei saidthe idea that man should redeem the devil is quite new to me is it and he looked at me fixedlywellit is one form of the story and by no means the most unpoetical poor lucifer his punishment is of course eternal and the distance between himself and heaven must be rapidly increasing every dayfor man will never assist him to retrieve his error man will reject god fast enough and gladly enoughbut never the devil judge then how under the peculiar circumstances of his doom this lucifer son of the morning satan or whatever else he is called must hate humanity i smiled well he has one remedy left to himi observedhe need not tempt anybody you forgethe is bound to keep his word according to the legendsaid rimnezhe swore before god that he would destroy man utterlyhe must therefore fulfil that oath if he can angels it would seem may not swear before the eternal without endeavouring at least to fulfil their vowsmen swear in the name of god every day without the slightest intention of carrying out their promises but its all the veriest nonsensei said somewhat impatientlyall these old legends are rubbish you tell the story well and almost as if you believed in itthat is because you have the gift of speaking with eloquence nowadays no one believes in either devils or angelsi for example do not even believe in the soul i know you do nothe answered suavelyand your scepticism is very comfortable because it relieves you of all personal responsibility i envy you fori regret to say i am compelled to believe in the soul compelled i echoedthat is absurdno one can compel you to accept a mere theory he looked at me with a flitting smile that darkened rather than lightened his face true very true there is no compelling force in the whole universeman is the supreme and independent creaturemaster of all he surveys and owning no other dominion save his personal desire truei forgot let us avoid theology please and psychology alsolet us talk about the only subject that has any sense or interest in itnamely money i perceive your present plans are definiteyou wish to publish a book that shall create a stir and make you famous it seems a modest enough campaign have you no wider ambitions there are several ways you know of getting talked about shall i enumerate them for your consideration i laughed if you like well in the first place i should suggest your getting yourself properly paragraphed it must be known to the press that you are an exceedingly rich man there is an agency for the circulation of paragraphsi daresay theyll do it sufficiently well for about ten or twenty guineas i opened my eyes a little at this oh is that the way these things are done my dear fellow how else should they be done he demanded somewhat impatientlydo you think anything in the world is done without money are the poor hardworking journalists your brothers or your bosom friends that they should lift you into public notice without getting something for their trouble if you do not manage them properly in this way theyll abuse you quite heartily and free of costthat i can promise you i know a literary agent a very worthy man too who for a hundred guineas down will so ply the paragraph wheel that in a few weeks it shall seem to the outside public that geoffrey tempest the millionaire is the only person worth talking about and the one desirable creature whom to shake hands with is next in honour to meeting royalty itself secure him i said indolentlyand pay him two hundred guineas so shall all the world hear of me when you have been paragraphed thoroughly went on rimnezthe next move will be a dash into what is called swagger society this must be done cautiously and by degrees you must be presented at the first leve of the season and later on i will get you an invitation to some great ladys house where you will meet the prince of wales privately at dinner if you can oblige or please his royal highness in any way so much the better for youhe is at least the most popular royalty in europe so it should not be difficult to you to make yourself agreeable following </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> following upon this event you must purchase a fine country seat and have that fact paragraphedthen you can rest and look roundsociety will have taken you up and you will find yourself in the swim i laughed heartilywell entertained by his fluent discourse i should not he resumedpropose your putting yourself to the trouble of getting into parliament that is no longer necessary to the career of a gentleman but i should strongly recommend your winning the derby i daresay you would i answered mirthfullyits an admirable suggestionbut not very easy to follow if you wish to win the derby he rejoined quietlyyou shall win it ill guarantee both horse and jockey something in his decisive tone impressed me and i leaned forward to study his features more closely are you a worker of miracles i asked him jestinglydo you mean it try me he respondedshall i enter a horse for you you cant its too late i said you would need to be the devil himself to do it besides i dont care about racing you will have to amend your taste thenhe repliedthat is if you want to make yourself agreeable to the english aristocracy for they are interested in little else no really great lady is without her betting book though she may be deficient in her knowledge of spelling you may make the biggest literary furore of the season and that will count as nothing among swagger people but if you win the derby you will be a really famous man personally speaking i have a great deal to do with racingin fact i am devoted to it i am always present at every great racei never miss one i always bet and i never lose and now let me proceed with your social plan of action after winning the derby you will enter for a yacht race at cowes and allow the prince of wales to beat you just narrowly then you will give a grand dinner arranged by a perfect chefand you will entertain his royal highness to the strains of britannia rules the waves which will serve as a pretty compliment you will allude to the same wellworn song in a graceful speechand the probable result of all this will be one or perhaps two royal invitations so far so good with the heats of summer you will go to homburg to drink the waters there whether you require them or notand in the autumn you will assemble a shootingparty at the country seat beforementioned which you will have purchased and invite royalty to join you in killing the poor little partridges then your name in society may be considered as made and you can marry whatever fair lady happens to be in the market thanksmuch obliged and i gave way to hearty laughterupon my word lucio your programme is perfect it lacks nothing it is the orthodox round of social success said lucio with admirable gravityintellect and originality have nothing whatever to do with itonly money is needed to perform it all you forget my booki interposedi know there is some intellect in that and some originality too surely that will give me an extra lift up the heights of fashionable light and leading i doubt it he answeredi very much doubt it it will be received with a certain amount of favour of course as a production of a rich man amusing himself with literature as a sort of whim but as i told you before genius seldom develops itself under the influence of wealth then again swagger folks can never get it out of their fuddled heads that literature belongs to grub street great poets great philosophers great romancists are always vaguely alluded to by swagger society as those sort of people those sort of people are so interesting say the blueblooded noodles deprecatingly excusing themselves as it were for knowing any members of the class literary you can fancy a swagger lady of elizabeths time asking a friendo do you mind my dear if i bring one master william shakespeare to see you he writes plays and does something or other at the globe theatrein fact im afraid he acts a littlehes not very well off poor manbut these sort of people are always so amusing now you my dear tempest are not a shakespeare but your millions will give you a better chance than he ever had in his lifetime as you will not have to sue for patronage or practise a reverence for my lord or my ladythese exalted personages will be only too delighted to borrow money of you if you will lend it i shall not lendi said nor give nor give his keen eyes flashed approval i am very glad he observed that you are determined not to go about doing good as the canting humbugs say with your money you are wise spend on yourselfbecause your very act of spending cannot but benefit others through various channels now i pursue a different course i always help charities and put my name on subscriptionlistsand i never fail to assist a certain portion of clergy i rather wonder at that i remarkedespecially as you tell me you are not a christian yesit does seem strangedoesnt ithe said with an extraordinary accent of what might be termed apologetic derisionbut perhaps you dont look at it in the proper light many of the clergy are doing their utmost best to destroy religionby cant by hypocrisy by sensuality by shams of every descriptionand when they seek my help in this noble work i give itfreely i laughed you must have your joke evidentlyi said throwing the end of my finished cigar into the fireand i see you are fond of satirizing your own good actions hullo whats this for at that moment amiel entered bearing a telegram for me on a silver salver i opened itit was from my friend the publisher and ran as follows accept book with pleasure send manuscript immediately i showed this to rimnez with a kind of triumph he smiled of course what else did you expect only the man should have worded his telegram differently for i do not suppose he would accept the book with pleasure if he had to lay out his own cash upon it accept money for publishing book with pleasure should have been the true message of the wire well what are you going to do i shall see about this at oncei answered feeling a thrill of satisfaction that at last the time of vengeance on certain of my enemies was approachingthe book must be hurried through the press as quickly as possibleand i shall take a particular pleasure in personally attending to all the details concerning it for the rest of my plans leave them to me said rimnez laying his finely shaped white hand with a masterful pressure on my shoulder leave them to meand be sure that before very long i shall have set you aloft like the bear who has successfully reached the bun on the top of a greased polea spectacle for the envy of men and the wonder of angels vii the next three or four weeks flew by in a whirl of excitement and by the time they were ended i found it hard to recognize myself in the indolent listless extravagant man of fashion i had so suddenly become sometimes at stray and solitary moments the past turned back upon me like a revolving picture in a glass with a flash of unwelcome recollection and i saw myself worn and hungry and shabbily clothed bending over my writing in my dreary lodging wretched yet amid all my wretchedness receiving curious comfort from my own thoughts which created beauty out of penury and love out of loneliness this creative faculty was now dormant in mei did very little and thought less but i felt certain that this intellectual apathy was but a passing phasea mental holiday and desirable cessation from brainwork to which i was deservedly entitled after all my sufferings at the hands of poverty and disappointment my book was nearly through the pressand perhaps the chiefest pleasure of any i now enjoyed was the correction of the proofs as they passed under my supervision yet even this the satisfaction of authorship had its drawbackand my particular grievance was somewhat singular i read my own work with gratification of course for i was not behind my contemporaries in thinking well of myself in all i didbut my complacent literary egoism was mixed with a good deal of disagreeable astonishment and incredulity because my work written with enthusiasm and feeling propounded sentiments and inculcated theories which i personally did not believe in now how had this happened i asked myself why had i thus invited the public to accept me at a false valuation i paused to considerand i found the suggestion puzzling how came i to write the book at all seeing that it was utterly unlike me as i now knew myself my pen consciously or unconsciously had written down things which my reasoning faculties entirely repudiatedsuch as belief in a godtrust in the eternal possibilities of mans diviner progressi credited neither of these doctrines when i imagined such transcendental and foolish dreams i was poorstarvingand without a friend in the worldremembering all this i promptly set down </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> down my socalled inspiration to the action of an illnourished brain yet there was something subtle in the teaching of the story and one afternoon when i was revising some of the last proof sheets i caught myself thinking that the book was nobler than its writer this idea smote me with a sudden pangi pushed my papers aside and walking to the window looked out it was raining hard and the streets were black with mud and slushthe footpassengers were drenched and miserablethe whole prospect was dreary and the fact that i was a rich man did not in the least lift from my mind the depression that had stolen on me unawares i was quite alone for i had my own suite of rooms now in the hotel not far from those occupied by prince rimnez i also had my own servant a respectable good sort of fellow whom i rather liked because he shared to the full the instinctive aversion i felt for the princes man amiel then i had my own carriage and horses with attendant coachman and groomso that the prince and i though the most intimate friends in the world were able to avoid that familiarity which breeds contempt by keeping up our own separate establishments on this particular afternoon i was in a more miserable humour than ever my poverty had brought upon me yet from a strictly reasonable point of view i had nothing to be miserable about i was in full possession of my fortunei enjoyed excellent health and i had everything i wanted with the added consciousness that if my wants increased i could gratify them easily the paragraph wheel under lucios management had been worked with such good effect that i had seen myself mentioned in almost every paper in london and the provinces as the famous millionaireand for the benefit of the public who are sadly uninstructed on these matters i may here state as a very plain unvarnished truth that for forty pounds1 a wellknown agency will guarantee the insertion of any paragraph provided it is not libellous in no less than four hundred newspapers the art of booming is thus easily explained and levelheaded people will be able to comprehend why it is that a few names of authors are constantly mentioned in the press while others perhaps more deserving remain ignored merit counts as nothing in such circumstancesmoney wins the day and the persistent paragraphing of my name together with a description of my personal appearance and my marvellous literary gifts combined with a deferential and almost awestruck allusion to the millions which made me so interestingthe paragraph was written out by lucio and handed for circulation to the agency aforesaid with money downall this i say brought upon me two inflictionsfirst any amount of invitations to social and artistic functionsand secondly a continuous stream of beggingletters i was compelled to employ a secretary who occupied a room near my suite and who was kept hard at work all day needless to say i refused all appeals for moneyno one had helped me in my distress with the exception of my old chum bofflesno one save he had given me even so much as a word of sympathyi was resolved now to be as hard and as merciless as i had found my contemporaries i had a certain grim pleasure in reading letters from two or three literary men asking for work as secretary or companion or failing that for the loan of a little cash to tide over present difficulties one of these applicants was a journalist on the staff of a wellknown paper who had promised to find me work and who instead of doing so had as i afterwards learned strongly dissuaded his editor from giving me any employment he never imagined that tempest the millionaire and tempest the literary hack were one and the same personso little do the majority think that wealth can ever fall to the lot of authors i wrote to him myself however and told him what i deemed it well he should know adding my sarcastic thanks for his friendly assistance to me in time of needand herein i tasted something of the sharp delight of vengeance i never heard from him again and i am pretty sure my letter gave him material not only for astonishment but meditation yet with all the advantages over both friends and enemies which i now possessed i could not honestly say i was happy i knew i could have every possible enjoyment and amusement the world had to offeri knew i was one of the most envied among men and yetas i stood looking out of the window at the persistently falling rain i was conscious of a bitterness rather than a sweetness in the full cup of fortune many things that i had imagined would give me intense satisfaction had fallen curiously flat for example i had flooded the press with the most carefully worded and prominent advertisements of my forthcoming book and when i was poor i had pictured to myself how i should revel in doing thisnow that it was done i cared nothing at all about it i was simply weary of the sight of my own advertised name i certainly did look forward with very genuine feeling and expectation to the publication of my work when that should be an accomplished factbut today even that idea had lost some of its attractiveness owing to this new and unpleasant impression on my mind that the contents of that book were as utterly the reverse of my own true thoughts as they could well be a fog began to darken down over the streets in company with the rainand disgusted with the weather and with myself i turned away from the window and settled into an armchair by the fire poking the coal till it blazed and wondering what i should do to rid my mind of the gloom that threatened to envelop it in as thick a canopy as that of the london fog a tap came at the door and in answer to my somewhat irritable come in rimnez entered what all in the dark tempest he exclaimed cheerfullywhy dont you light up the fires enoughi answered crosslyenough at any rate to think by and have you been thinking he inquired laughingdont do it its a bad habit no one thinks nowadayspeople cant stand ittheir heads are too frail once begin to think and down go the foundations of societybesides thinking is always dull work i have found it so i said gloomilylucio there is something wrong about me somewhere his eyes flashed keen halfamused inquiry into mine wrong oh no surely not what can there be wrong about you tempest are you not one of the richest men living i let the satire pass listen my friend i said earnestlyyou know i have been busy for the last fortnight correcting the proofs of my book for the pressdo you not he nodded with a smiling air well i have arrived almost at the end of my work and i have come to the conclusion that the book is not meit is not a reflex of my feelings at alland i cannot understand how i came to write it you find it stupid perhaps said lucio sympathetically no i answered with a touch of indignationi do not find it stupid dull then noit is not dull melodramatic nonot melodramatic well my good fellow if it is not dull or stupid or melodramatic what is it he exclaimed merrilyit must be something yesit is thisit is beyond me altogether and i spoke with some bitterness quite beyond me i could not write it nowi wonder i could write it then lucio i daresay i am talking foolishlybut it seems to me i must have been on some higher altitude of thought when i wrote the booka height from which i have since fallen im sorry to hear this he answered with twinkling eyesfrom what you say it appears to me you have been guilty of literary sublimity oh bad very bad nothing can be worse to write sublimely is a grievous sin and one which critics never forgive im really grieved for you my friendi never thought your case was quite so desperate i laughed in spite of my depression you are incorrigible lucio i saidbut your cheerfulness is very inspiriting all i wanted to explain to you is thisthat my book expresses a certain tone of thought which purporting to be mine is not mein short i in my present self have no sympathy with it i must have changed very much since i wrote it changed why yes i should think so and lucio laughed heartilythe possession of five millions is bound to change a man considerably for the betteror worse but you seem to be worrying yourself most absurdly about nothing not one author in many centuries writes from his own heart or as he truly feelswhen he does he becomes wellnigh immortal this planet is too limited to hold more than one homer one plato one shakespeare dont distress yourselfyou are neither of these three you belong to the age tempestit is a decadent ephemeral age and most things connected with it are decadent and ephemeral any era that is dominated by </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> by the love of money only has a rotten core within it and must perish all history tells us so but no one accepts the lesson of history observe the signs of the timeart is made subservient to the love of moneyliterature politics and religion the sameyou cannot escape from the general disease the only thing to do is to make the best of itno one can reform itleast of all you who have so much of the lucre given to your share he pausedi was silent watching the bright fireglow and the dropping red cinders what i am going to say now he proceeded in soft almost melancholy accentswill sound ridiculously tritestill it has the perverse prosiness of truth about it it is thisin order to write with intense feeling you must first feel very likely when you wrote this book of yours you were almost a human hedgehog in the way of feeling every prickly point of you was erect and responsive to the touch of all influences pleasant or the reverse imaginative or realistic this is a condition which some people envy and others would rather dispense with now that you as a hedgehog have no further need for either alarm indignation or selfdefence your prickles are soothed into an agreeable passiveness and you partially cease to feel that is all the change you complain of is thus accounted foryou have nothing to feel abouthence you cannot comprehend how it was that you ever felt i was conscious of irritation at the calm conviction of his tone do you take me for such a callous creature as all that i exclaimedyou are mistaken in me lucio i feel most keenly what do you feel he inquired fixing his eyes steadily upon methere are hundreds of starving wretches in this metropolismen and women on the brink of suicide because they have no hope of anything in this world or the next and no sympathy from their kinddo you feel for them do their griefs affect you you know they do notyou know you never think of themwhy should you one of the chief advantages of wealth is the ability it gives us to shut out other peoples miseries from our personal consideration i said nothingfor the first time my spirit chafed at the truth of his words principally because they were true alas lucioif i had only known then what i know now yesterday he went on in the same quiet voicea child was run over here just opposite this hotel it was only a poor childmark that only its mother ran shrieking out of some backstreet hard by in time to see the little bleeding body carted up in a mangled heap she struck wildly with both hands at the men who were trying to lead her away and with a cry like that of some hurt savage animal fell face forward in the muddead she was only a poor womananother only there were three lines in the paper about it headed sad incident the hotelporter here witnessed the scene from the door with as composed a demeanor as that of a fop at the play never relaxing the serene majesty of his attitudebut about ten minutes after the dead body of the woman had been carried out of sight he the imperial goldbuttoned being became almost crookbacked in his servile haste to run and open the door of your brougham my dear geoffrey as you drove up to the entrance this is a little epitome of life as it is lived nowadaysand yet the canting clerics swear we are all equal in the sight of heaven we may be though it does not look much like itand if we are it does not matter as we have ceased to care how heaven regards us i dont want to point a morali simply tell you the sad incident as it occurredand i am sure you are not the least sorry for the fate of either the child who was run over or its mother who died in the sharp agony of a suddenly broken heart now dont say you are because i know youre not how can one feel sorry for people one does not know or has never seen i began exactlyhow is it possible and there we have ithow can one feel when ones self is so thoroughly comfortable as to be without any other feeling save that of material ease thus my dear geoffrey you must be content to let your book appear as the reflex and record of your past when you were in the prickly or sensitive stagenow you are encased in a pachydermatous covering of gold which adequately protects you from such influences as might have made you start and writhe perhaps even roar with indignation and in the access of fierce torture stretch out your hands and graspquite unconsciouslythe winged thing called fame you should have been an oratori said rising and pacing the room to and fro in vexationbut to me your words are not consoling and i do not think they are true fame is easily enough secured pardon me if i am obstinatesaid lucio with a deprecatory gesturenotoriety is easily securedvery easily a few critics who have dined with you and had their fill of wine will give you notoriety but fame is the voice of the whole civilized public of the world the public i echoed contemptuouslythe public only care for trash it is a pity you should appeal to it thenhe responded with a smileif you think so little of the public why give it anything of your brain it is not worthy of so rare a boon come come tempestdo not join in the snarl of unsuccessful authors who take refuge when marked unsaleable in pouring out abuse on the public the public is the authors best friend and truest critic but if you prefer to despise it in company with all the very little literaturemongers who form a mutual admiration society i tell you what to doprint just twenty copies of your book and present these to the leading reviewers and when they have written you up as they will doill take care of that let your publisher advertise to the effect that the first and second large editions of the new novel by geoffrey tempest are exhausted one hundred thousand copies having been sold in a week if that does not waken up the world in general i shall be much surprised i laughedi was gradually getting into a better humour it would be quite as fair a plan of action as is adopted by many modern publishers i saidthe loud hawking of literary wares nowadays reminds me of the rival shouting of costermongers in a low neighbourhood but i will not go quite so farill win my fame legitimately if i can you cant declared lucio with a serene smileits impossible you are too rich that of itself is not legitimate in literature which great art generally elects to wear poverty in its buttonhole as a flower of grace the fight cannot be equal in such circumstances the fact that you are a millionaire must weigh the balance apparently in your favour for a time the world cannot resist money if i for example became an author i should probably with my wealth and influence burn up every one elses laurels suppose that a desperately poor man comes out with a book at the same time as you do he will have scarcely the ghost of a chance against you he will not be able to advertise in your lavish stylenor will he see his way to dine the critics as you can and if he should happen to have more genius than you and you succeed your success will not be legitimate but after all that does not matter muchin art if in nothing else things always right themselves i made no immediate reply but went over to my table rolled up my corrected proofs and directed them to the printersthen ringing the bell i gave the packet to my man morris bidding him post it at once this done i turned again towards lucio and saw that he still sat by the fire but that his attitude was now one of brooding melancholy and that he had covered his eyes with one hand on which the glow from the flames shone red i regretted the momentary irritation i had felt against him for telling me unwelcome truthsand i touched him lightly on the shoulder are you in the dumps now lucio i saidim afraid my depression has proved infectious he moved his hand and looked uphis eyes were large and lustrous as the eyes of a beautiful woman i was thinking he said with a slight sighof the last words i uttered just nowthings always right themselves curiously enough in art they always dono charlatanism or sham lasts with the gods of parnassus but in other matters it is different for instance i shall never right myself life is hateful to me at times as it is to everybody perhaps you are in love i said with a smile he started up in love by all the heavens and all the earths too that suggestion wakes me with a vengeance in love what woman alive do you think could impress </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> impress me with the notion that she was anything more than a frivolous doll of pink and white with long hair frequently not her own and as for the tomboy tennisplayers and giantesses of the era i do not consider them women at allthey are merely the unnatural and strutting embryos of a new sex which will be neither male nor female my dear tempest i hate women so would you if you knew as much about them as i do they have made me what i am and they keep me so they are to be much complimented theni observedyou do them credit i do he answered slowlyin more ways than one a faint smile was on his face and his eyes brightened with that curious jewellike gleam i had noticed several times before believe me i shall never contest with you such a slight gift as womans love geoffrey it is not worth fighting for and apropos of women that reminds mei have promised to take you to the earl of eltons box at the haymarket tonighthe is a poor peer very gouty and somewhat heavily flavoured with portwine but his daughter lady sibyl is one of the belles of england she was presented last season and created quite a furore will you come i am quite at your dispositioni said glad of any excuse to escape the dullness of my own company and to be in that of lucio whose talk even if its satire galled me occasionally always fascinated my mind and remained in my memorywhat time shall we meet go and dress now and join me at dinnerhe answered and well drive together to the theatre afterwards the play is on the usual theme which has lately become popular with stagemanagersthe glorification of a fallen lady and the exhibition of her as an example of something superlatively pure and good to the astonished eyes of the innocent as a play it is not worth seeingbut perhaps lady sibyl is he smiled again as he stood facing methe light flames of the fire had died down to a dull uniform coppery redwe were almost in darkness and i pressed the small button near the mantelpiece that flooded the room with electric light his extraordinary beauty then struck me afresh as something altogether singular and half unearthly dont you find that people look at you very often as you pass lucio i asked him suddenly and impulsively he laughed not at all why should they every man is so intent on his own aims and thinks so much of his own personality that he would scarcely forget his ego if the very devil himself were behind him women look at me sometimes with the affected coy and kittenlike interest usually exhibited by the frail sex for a personable man i cannot blame them i answered my gaze still resting on his stately figure and fine head with as much admiration as i might have felt for a noble picture or statuewhat of this lady sibyl we are to meet tonighthow does she regard you lady sibyl has never seen mehe repliedand i have only seen her at a distance it is chiefly for the purpose of an introduction to her that the earl has asked us to his box this evening ha ha matrimony in view i exclaimed jestingly yesi believe lady sibyl is for salehe answered with the callous coldness that occasionally distinguished him and made his handsome features look like an impenetrable mask of scornbut up to the present the bids have not been sufficiently high and i shall not purchase i have told you already tempest i hate women seriously most seriously women have always done me harmthey have wantonly hindered me in my progress and why i specially abominate them is that they have been gifted with an enormous power for doing good and that they let this power run to waste and will not use it their deliberate enjoyment and choice of the repulsive vulgar and commonplace side of life disgusts me they are much less sensitive than men and infinitely more heartless they are the mothers of the human race and the faults of the race are chiefly due to them that is another reason for my hatred do you want the human race to be perfect i asked astonishedbecause if you do you will find that impossible he stood for a moment apparently lost in thought everything in the universe is perfecthe said except that curious piece of workman have you never thought out any reason why he should be the one flawthe one incomplete creature in a matchless creation no i have noti repliedi take things as i find them so do iand he turned away and as i find them so they find me au revoir dinner in an hours time remember the door opened and closedhe was gone i remained alone for a little thinking what a strange disposition was hiswhat a curious mixture of philosophy worldliness sentiment and satire seemed to run like the veins of a leaf through the variable temperament of this brilliant semimysterious personage who had by mere chance become my greatest friend we had now been more or less together for nearly a month and i was no closer to the secret of his actual nature than i had been at first yet i admired him more than everwithout his society i felt life would be deprived of half its charm for though attracted as human moths will be by the glare of my glittering millions numbers of socalled friends now surrounded me there was not one among them who so dominated my every mood and with whom i had so much close sympathy as this manthis masterful half cruel half kind companion of my days who at times seemed to accept all life as the veriest bagatelle and myself as a part of the trivial game 1 a fact viii no man i think ever forgets the first time he is brought face to face with perfect beauty in woman he may have caught fleeting glimpses of loveliness on many fair faces oftenbright eyes may have flashed on him like starbeamsthe hues of a dazzling complexion may now and then have charmed him or the seductive outlines of a graceful figureall these are as mere peeps into the infinite but when such vague and passing impressions are suddenly drawn together in one focuswhen all his dreamy fancies of form and colour take visible and complete manifestation in one living creature who looks down upon him as it were from an empyrean of untouched maiden pride and purity it is more to his honour than his shame if his senses swoon at the ravishing vision and he despite his rough masculinity and brute strength becomes nothing but the merest slave to passion in this way was i overwhelmed and conquered without any chance of deliverance when sibyl eltons violet eyes lifted slowly from the shadow of their dark lashes rested upon me with that indefinable expression of mingled interest and indifference which is supposed to indicate high breeding but which more frequently intimidates and repulses the frank and sensitive soul the lady sibyls glance repelled but i was none the less attracted rimnez and i had entered the earl of eltons box at the haymarket between the first and second acts of the play and the earl himself an unimpressive baldheaded redfaced old gentleman with fuzzy white whiskers had risen to welcome us seizing the princes hand and shaking it with particular effusiveness i learned afterwards that lucio had lent him a thousand pounds on easy terms a fact which partly accounted for the friendly fervour of his greeting his daughter had not moved but a minute or two later when he addressed her somewhat sharply saying sibyl prince rimnez and his friend mr geoffrey tempest she turned her head and honoured us both with the chill glance i have endeavoured to describe and the very faintest possible bow as an acknowledgment of our presence her exquisite beauty smote me dumb and foolishi could find nothing to say and stood silent and confused with a strange sensation of bewilderment upon me the old earl made some remark about the play which i scarcely heard though i answered vaguely and at haphazardthe orchestra was playing abominably as is usual in theatres and its brazen din sounded like the noise of the sea in my earsi had not much real consciousness of anything save the wondrous loveliness of the girl who faced me clad in pure white with a few diamonds shining about her like stray dewdrops on a rose lucio spoke to her and i listened at last lady sibyl he said bending towards her deferentially at last i have the honour of meeting you i have seen you often as one sees a starat a distance she smileda smile so slight and cold that it scarcely lifted the corners of her lovely lips i do not think i have ever seen you she replied and yet there is something oddly familiar in your face i have heard my father speak of you constantlyi need scarcely say his friends are always mine he bowed to merely speak to lady sibyl elton is counted sufficient to make the man so privileged happy he said to </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> to be her friend is to discover the lost paradise she flushedthen grew suddenly very pale and shivering she drew her cloak towards her rimnez wrapped its perfumed silken folds carefully round her beautiful shouldershow i grudged him the dainty task he then turned to me and placed a chair just behind hers will you sit here geoffrey he suggestedi want to have a moments business chat with lord elton recovering my selfpossession a little i hastened to take the chance he thus generously gave me to ingratiate myself in the young ladys favour and my heart gave a foolish bound of joy because she smiled encouragingly as i approached her you are a great friend of prince rimnez she asked softly as i sat down yes we are very intimate i repliedhe is a delightful companion so i should imagine and she looked over at him where he sat next to her father talking earnestly in low toneshe is singularly handsome i made no reply of course lucios extraordinary personal attractiveness was undeniablebut i rather grudged her praise bestowed on him just then her remarks seemed to me as tactless as when a man with one pretty woman beside him loudly admires another in her hearing i did not myself assume to be actually handsome but i knew i was better looking than the ordinary run of men so out of sudden pique i remained silent and presently the curtain rose and the play was resumed a very questionable scene was enacted the woman with the past being well to the front of it i felt disgusted at the performance and looked at my companions to see if they too were similarly moved there was no sign of disapproval on lady sibyls fair countenanceher father was bending forward eagerly apparently gloating over every detailrimnez wore that inscrutable expression of his in which no feeling whatever could be discerned the woman with the past went on with her hysterical shamheroics and the mealymouthed fool of a hero declared her to be a pure angel wronged and the curtain fell amid loud applause one energetic hiss came from the gallery affecting the occupants of the stalls to scandalized amazement england has progressed said rimnez in soft halfbantering tonesonce upon a time this play would have been hooted off the stage as likely to corrupt the social community but now the only voice of protest comes from the lower classes are you a democrat prince inquired lady sibyl waving her fan indolently to and fro not i i always insist on the pride and supremacy of worthi do not mean money value but intellect and in this way i foresee a new aristocracy when the high grows corrupt it falls and becomes the lowwhen the low educates itself and aspires it becomes the high this is simply the course of nature but god bless my soul exclaimed lord eltonyou dont call this play low or immoral do you its a realistic study of modern social lifethats what it is these women you knowthese poor souls with a pastare very interesting very murmured his daughterin fact it would seem that for women with no such past there can be no future virtue and modesty are quite out of date and have no chance whatever i leaned towards her half whispering lady sibyl i am glad to see this wretched play offends you she turned her deep eyes on me in mingled surprise and amusement oh no it doesnt she declaredi have seen so many like it and i have read so many novels on just the same theme i assure you i am quite convinced that the socalled bad woman is the only popular type of our sex with menshe gets all the enjoyment possible out of lifeshe frequently makes an excellent marriage and has as the americans say a good time all round its the same thing with our convicted criminalsin prison they are much better fed than the honest workingman i believe it is quite a mistake for women to be respectablethey are only considered dull ah now you are only joking i said with an indulgent smile you know that in your heart you think very differently she made no answer as just then the curtain went up again disclosing the unclean lady of the piece having a good time all round on board a luxurious yacht during the unnatural and stilted dialogue which followed i withdrew a little back into the shadow of the box and all that selfesteem and assurance of which i had been suddenly deprived by a glance at lady sibyls beauty came back to me and a perfectly stolid coolness and composure succeeded to the first feverish excitement of my mind i recalled lucios wordsi believe lady sibyl is for saleand i thought triumphantly of my millions i glanced at the old earl abjectly pulling at his white whiskers while he listened anxiously to what were evidently money schemes propounded by lucio then my gaze came back appraisingly to the lovely curves of lady sibyls milkwhite throat her beautiful arms and bosom her rich brown hair of the shade of a ripe chestnut her delicate haughty face languid eyes and brilliant complexionand i murmured inwardlyall this loveliness is purchaseable and i will purchase it at that very instant she turned to me and said you are the famous mr tempest are you not famous i echoed with a deep sense of gratificationwelli am scarcely thatyet my book is not published her eyebrows arched themselves surprisedly your book i did not know you had written one my flattered vanity sank to zero it has been extensively advertised i began impressivelybut she interrupted me with a laugh oh i never read advertisementsits too much trouble when i asked if you were the famous mr tempest i meant to say were you the great millionaire who has been so much talked of lately i bowed a somewhat chill assent she looked at me inquisitively over the lace edge of her fan how delightful it must be for you to have so much money she saidand you are young too and goodlooking pleasure took the place of vexed amourpropre and i smiled you are very kind lady sibyl why she asked laughingsuch a delicious little low laughbecause i tell you the truth you are young and you are goodlooking millionaires are generally such appalling creatures fortune while giving them money frequently deprives them of both brains and personal attractiveness and now do tell me about your book she seemed to have suddenly dispensed with her former reserve and during the last act of the play we conversed freely in whispers which assisted us to become almost confidential her manner to me now was full of grace and charm and the fascination she exerted over my senses became complete the performance over we all left the box together and as lucio was still apparently engrossed with lord elton i had the satisfaction of escorting lady sibyl to her carriage when her father joined her lucio and i both stood together looking in at the window of the brougham and the earl getting hold of my hand shook it up and down with boisterous friendliness come and dinecome and dine he spluttered excitedly comelet me seethis is tuesdaycome on thursday short notice and no ceremony my wife is paralysed im sorry to sayshe cant receiveshe can only see a few people now and then when she is in the humourher sister keeps house and does the honoursaunt charlotte eh sibylhahaha the deceased wifes sisters bill would never be any use to me for if my wife were to die i shouldnt be anxious to marry miss charlotte fitzroy ha ha ha a perfectly unapproachable woman sira modelha ha come and dine with us mr tempestlucio you bring him along with you eh weve got a young lady staying with usan american dollars accent and alland by jove i believe she wants to marry me ha ha ha and is waiting for lady elton to go to a better world first ha ha come alongcome and see the little american eh thursday shall it be over the fair features of lady sibyl there passed a faint shadow of annoyance at her fathers allusion to the little american but she said nothing only her looks appeared to question our intentions as well as to persuade our wills and she seemed satisfied when we both accepted the invitation given another apoplectic chuckle from the earl and a couple of handshakesa slight graceful bow from her lovely ladyship as we raised our hats in farewell and the elton equipage rolled away leaving us to enter our own vehicle which amid the officious roarings of streetboys and policemen had just managed to draw up in front of the theatre as we drove off lucio peered inquisitively at mei could see the steely glitter of his fine eyes in the semidarkness of the broughamand said well i was silent dont you admire her he went oni must confess she is colda very chilly vestal indeedbut snow often covers volcanoes she has good features and a naturally clear complexion despite my intention to be reticent i could not endure this tame description she is perfectly beautifuli said emphatically the dullest eyes must see that there is not a fault </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> fault to be found with her and she is wise to be reserved and coldwere she too lavish of her smiles and too seductive in manner she might drive many men not only into folly but madness i felt rather than saw the catlike glance he flashed upon me positively geoffrey i believe that notwithstanding the fact that we are only in february the wind blows upon you due south bringing with it odours of rose and orangeblossom i fancy lady sibyl has powerfully impressed you did you wish me to be impressed i asked i my dear fellow i wish nothing that you yourself do not wish i accommodate my ways to my friends humours if asked for my opinion i should say it is rather a pity if you are really smitten with the young lady as there are no obstacles to be encountered a loveaffair to be conducted with spirit and enterprise should always bristle with opposition and difficulty real or invented a little secrecy and a good deal of wrongdoing such as sly assignations and the telling of any amount of liessuch things add to the agreeableness of lovemaking on this planet i interrupted him see here lucio you are very fond of alluding to this planet as if you knew anything about other planetsi said impatiently this planet as you somewhat contemptuously call it is the only one we have any business with he bent his piercing looks so ardently upon me that for the moment i was startled if that is so he answered why in heavens name do you not let the other planets alone why do you strive to fathom their mysteries and movements if men as you say have no business with any planet save this one why are they ever on the alert to discover the secret of mightier worldsa secret which haply it may some day terrify them to know the solemnity of his voice and the inspired expression of his face awed me i had no reply ready and he went on do not let us talk my friend of planets not even of this particular pins point among them known as earth let us return to a better subjectthe lady sibyl as i have already said there are no obstacles in the way of your wooing and winning her if such is your desire geoffrey tempest as mere author of books would indeed be insolent to aspire to the hand of an earls daughter but geoffrey tempest millionaire will be a welcome suitor poor lord eltons affairs are in a bad wayhe is almost outatelbowsthe american woman who is boarding with him boarding with him i exclaimedsurely he does not keep a boardinghouse lucio laughed heartily no noyou must not put it so coarsely geoffrey it is simply this that the earl and countess of elton give the prestige of their home and protection to miss diana chesney the american aforesaid for the trifling sum of two thousand guineas per annum the countess being paralyzed is obliged to hand over her duties of chaperonage to her sister miss charlotte fitzroybut the halo of the coronet still hovers over miss chesneys brow she has her own suite of rooms in the house and goes wherever it is proper for her to go under miss fitzroys care lady sibyl does not like the arrangement and is therefore never seen anywhere except with her father she will not join in companionship with miss chesney and has said so pretty plainly i admire her for it i said warmlyi really am surprised that lord elton should condescend condescend to what inquired luciocondescend to take two thousand guineas a year good heavens man there are no end of lords and ladies who will readily agree to perform such an act of condescension blue blood is getting thin and poor and only money can thicken it diana chesney is worth over a million dollars and if lady elton were to die conveniently soon i should not be surprised to see that little american step triumphantly into her vacant place what a state of topsyturveydom i said half angrily geoffrey my friend you are really amazingly inconsistent is there a more flagrant example of topsyturveydom than yourself for instance six weeks ago what were you a mere scribbler with flutterings of the wings of genius in your soul but many uncertainties as to whether those wings would ever be strong enough to lift you out of the rut of obscurity in which you floundered struggling and grumbling at adverse fate now as millionaire you think contemptuously of an earl because he ventures quite legitimately to add a little to his income by boarding an american heiress and launching her into society where she would never get without him and you aspire or probably mean to aspire to the hand of the earls daughter as if you yourself were a descendant of kings nothing can be more topsyturvey than your condition my father was a gentleman i said with a touch of hauteur and a descendant of gentlemen we were never common folkour family was one of the most highly esteemed in the counties lucio smiled i do not doubt it my dear fellowi do not in the least doubt it but a simple gentleman is a long way belowor abovean earl have it which side you choosebecause it really doesnt matter nowadays we have come to a period of history when rank and lineage count as nothing at all owing to the profoundly obtuse stupidity of those who happen to possess it so it chances that as no resistance is made brewers are created peers of the realm and ordinary tradesmen are knighted and the very old families are so poor that they have to sell their estates and jewels to the highest bidder who is frequently a vulgar railwayking or the introducer of some new manure you occupy a better position than such since you inherit your money with the farther satisfaction that you do not know how it was made true i answered meditativelythen with a sudden flash of recollection i addedby the way i never told you that my deceased relative imagined that he had sold his soul to the devil and that this vast fortune of his was the material result lucio burst into a violent fit of laughter no not possible he exclaimed derisivelywhat an idea i suppose he had a screw loose somewhere imagine any sane man believing in a devil ha ha ha and in these advanced days too well well the folly of human imaginations will never end here we areand he sprang lightly out as the brougham stopped at the grand hoteli will say goodnight to you tempest ive promised to go and have a gamble a gamble where at one of the select private clubs there are any amount of them in this eminently moral metropolisno occasion to go to monte carlo will you come i hesitated the fair face of lady sibyl haunted my mindand i felt with a no doubt foolish sentimentality that i would rather keep my thoughts of her sacred and unpolluted by contact with things of lower tone not tonighti saidthen half smiling i addedit must be rather a onesided affair for other men to gamble with you lucio you can afford to loseand perhaps they cant if they cant they shouldnt playhe answereda man should at least know his own mind and his own capacity if he doesnt he is no man at all as far as i have learned by long experience those who gamble like it and when they like it i like it ill take you with me tomorrow if you care to see the funone or two very eminent men are members of the club though of course they wouldnt have it known for worlds you shant lose muchill see to that all righttomorrow it shall bei responded for i did not wish to appear as though i grudged losing a few pounds at playbut tonight i think ill write some letters before going to bed yesand dream of lady sibyl said lucio laughingif she fascinates you as much when you see her again on thursday you had better begin the siege he waved his hand gaily and reentering his carriage was driven off at a furious pace through the drifting fog and rain ix my publisher john morgesonthe estimable individual who had first refused my book and who now moved by selfinterest was devoting his energies assiduously to the business of launching it in the most modern and approved style was not like shakespeares cassio strictly an honourable man neither was he the respectable chief of a longestablished firm whose system of the cheating of authors mellowed by time had become almost sacredhe was a new man with new ways and a good stock of new push and impudence all the same he was clever shrewd and diplomatic and for some reason or other had secured the favour of a certain portion of the press many of the dailies and weeklies always giving special prominence to his publications over the heads of other far more legitimately dealing firms he entered into a partial explanation of his methods when on the morning after my first meeting with the earl of elton and his daughter i </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> i called upon him to inquire how things were going with regard to my book we shall publish next weekhe said rubbing his hands complacently and addressing me with all the deference due to my banking accountand as you dont mind what you spend ill tell you just what i propose to do i intend to write out a mystifying paragraph of about some seventy lines or so describing the book in a vague sort of way as likely to create a new era of thoughtor ere long everybody who is anybody will be compelled to read this remarkable workor as something that must be welcome to all who would understand the drift of one of the most delicate and burning questions of the time these are all stock phrases used over and over again by the reviewerstheres no copyright in them and the last one always tells wonderfully considering how old it is and how often it has been made to do duty because any allusion to a delicate and burning question makes a number of people think the novel must be improper and they send for it at once he chuckled at his own perspicuity and i sat silent studying him with much inward amusement this man on whose decision i had humbly and anxiously waited not so many weeks ago was now my paid toolready to obey me to any possible extent for so much cashand i listened to him indulgently while he went on unravelling his schemes for the gratification of my vanity and the pocketing of his extras the book has been splendidly advertisedhe went on it could not have been more lavishly done orders do not come in very fast yetbut they willthey will this paragraph of mine which will take the shape of a leaderette i can get inserted in about eight hundred to a thousand newspapers here and in america it will cost yousay a hundred guineasperhaps a trifle more do you mind that not in the least i replied still vastly amused he meditated a momentthen drew his chair closer to mine and lowered his voice a little you understand i suppose that i shall only issue two hundred and fifty copies at first this limited number seemed to me absurd and i protested vehemently such an idea is ridiculous i saidyou cannot supply the trade with such a scanty edition wait my dear sir waityou are too impatient you do not give me time to explain all these two hundred and fifty will be given away by me in the proper quarters on the day of publicationnever mind howthey must be given away why why and the worthy morgeson laughed sweetlyi see my dear mr tempest you are like most men of geniusyou do not understand business the reason why we give the first two hundred and fifty copies away is in order to be able to announce at once in all the papers that the first large edition of the new novel by geoffrey tempest being exhausted on the day of publication a second is in rapid preparation you see we thus hoodwink the public who of course are not in our secrets and are not to know whether an edition is two hundred or two thousand the second edition will of course be ready behind the scenes and will consist of another two hundred and fifty do you call that course of procedure honest i asked quietly honest my dear sir honest and his countenance wore a virtuously injured expressionof course it is honest look at the daily papers such announcements appear every dayin fact they are getting rather too common i freely admit that there are a few publishers here and there who stick up for exactitude and go to the trouble of not only giving the number of copies in an edition but also publishing the date of each one as it was issuedthis may be principle if they like to call it so but it involves a great deal of precise calculation and worry if the public like to be deceived what is the use of being exact now to resumeyour second edition will be sent off on sale or return to provincial booksellers and then we shall announcein consequence of the enormous demand for the new novel by geoffrey tempest the large second edition is out of print a third will be issued in the course of next week and so on and so on till we get to the sixth or seventh edition always numbering two hundred and fifty each in three volumes perhaps we can by skilful management work it to a tenth it is only a question of diplomacy and a little dexterous humbugging of the trade then we shall arrive at the onevolume issue which will require different handling but theres time enough for that the frequent advertisements will add to the expense a bit but if you dont mind i dont mind anything i saidso long as i have my fun your fun he queried surprisedlyi thought it was fame you wanted more than fun i laughed aloud im not such a fool as to suppose that fame is secured by advertisement i saidfor instance i am one of those who think the fame of millais as an artist was marred when he degraded himself to the level of painting the little green boy blowing bubbles of pearss soap that was an advertisement and that very incident in his career trifling though it seems will prevent his ever standing on the same dignified height of distinction with such masters in art as romney sir peter lely gainsborough or reynolds i believe there is a great deal of justice in what you say and morgeson shook his head wiselyviewed from a purely artistic and sentimental standpoint you are right and he became suddenly downcast and dubious yesit is a most extraordinary thing how fame does escape people sometimes just when they seem on the point of grasping it they are boomed in every imaginable way and yet after a time nothing will keep them up and there are others again who get kicked and buffeted and mocked and derided like christ i interposed with a half smile he looked shockedhe was a nonconformistbut remembering in time how rich i was he bowed with a meek patience yesand he sighedas you suggest mr tempest like christ mocked and derided and opposed at every turnand yet by the queerest caprice of destiny they succeed in winning a worldwide fame and power like christ again i said mischievously for i loved to jar his nonconformist conscience exactly he paused looking piously down then with a return of secular animation he addedbut i was not thinking of the great example just then mr tempesti was thinking of a woman indeed i said indifferently yesa woman who despite continued abuse and opposition is rapidly becoming celebrated you are sure to hear of her in literary and social circlesand he gave me a furtive glance of doubtful inquirybut she is not rich you knowonly famous howeverwe have nothing to do with her just nowso let us return to business the one uncertain point in the matter of your books success is the attitude of the critics there are only six leading men who do the reviews and between them they cover all the english magazines and some of the american too as well as the london papers here are their namesand he handed me a pencilled memorandumand their addresses as far as i can ascertain them or the addresses of the papers for which they most frequently write the man at the head of the list david mcwhing is the most formidable of the lot he writes everywhere about everythingbeing a scotchman hes bound to have his finger in every pie if you can secure mcwhing you need not trouble so much about the others as he generally gives the lead and has his own way with the editors he is one of the personal friends of the editor of the nineteenth century for example and you would be sure to get a notice there which would otherwise be impossible no reviewer can review anything for that magazine unless he is one of the editors friends2 you must manage mcwhing or he might just for the sake of showing off cut you up rather roughly that would not matter i said diverted at the idea of managing mcwhinga little slating always helps a book to sell in some cases it doesand morgeson stroked his thin beard perplexedlybut in others it most emphatically does not where there is any very decided or daring originality adverse criticism is always the most effective but a work like yours requires fostering with favourwants booming in short i see and i felt distinctly annoyedyou dont think my book original enough to stand alone my dear siryou are reallyreally what shall i say and he smiled apologeticallya little brusque i think your book shows admirable scholarship and delicacy of thoughtif i find fault with it at all it is perhaps because i am dense the only thing it lacks in my opinion is what i should call tenaciousness for want of a better expressionthe quality of holding the readers fancy fixed like a nail but after all this is a common failing of </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> of modern literature few authors feel sufficiently themselves to make others feel i made no reply for a moment i was thinking of lucios remarks on this very same subject well i said at lastif i had no feeling when i wrote the book i certainly have none now why man i felt every line of itpainfully and intensely ay ay indeed said morgeson soothinglyor perhaps you thought you felt which is another very curious phase of the literary temperament you see to convince people at all you must first yourself be convinced the result of this is generally a singular magnetic attraction between author and public however i am a bad hand at argumentand it is possible that in hasty reading i may have gathered a wrong impression of your intentions anyhow the book shall be a success if we can make it so all i venture to ask of you is that you should personally endeavour to manage mcwhing i promised to do my best and on this understanding we parted i realised that morgeson was capable of greater discernment than i had imagined and his observations had given me material for thought which was not altogether agreeable for if my book as he said lacked tenacity why then it would not take root in the public mindit would be merely the ephemeral success of a seasonone of those brief booms in literary wares for which i had such unmitigated contemptand fame would be as far off as ever except that spurious imitation of it which the fact of my millions had secured i was in no good humour that afternoon and lucio saw it he soon elicited the sum and substance of my interview with morgeson and laughed long and somewhat uproariously over the proposed managing of the redoubtable mcwhing he glanced at the five names of the other leading critics and shrugged his shoulders morgeson is quite righthe saidmcwhing is intimate with the rest of these fellowsthey meet at the same clubs dine at the same cheap restaurants and make love to the same painted balletgirls all in a comfortable little fraternal union together and one obliges the other on their several journals when occasion offers oh yes i should make up to mcwhing if i were you but how i demanded for though i knew mcwhings name well enough having seen it signed ad nauseam to literary articles in almost every paper extant i had never met the man i cannot ask any favour of a press critic of course not and lucio laughed heartily againif you were to do such an idiotic thing what a slating youd get for your pains theres no sport a critic loves so much as the flaying of an author who has made the mistake of lowering himself to the level of asking favours of his intellectual inferiors no no my dear fellowwe shall manage mcwhing quite differentlyi know him though you do not come thats good news i exclaimedupon my word lucio you seem to know everybody i think i know most people worth knowing responded lucio quietlythough i by no means include mr mcwhing in the category of worthiness i happened to make his personal acquaintance in a somewhat singular and exciting manner it was in switzerland on that awkward ledge of rock known as the mauvais pas i had been some weeks in the neighbourhood on business of my own and being surefooted and fearless was frequently allowed by the guides to volunteer my services with theirs in this capacity of amateur guide capricious destiny gave me the pleasure of escorting the timid and bilious mcwhing across the chasms of the mer de glace and i conversed with him in the choicest french all the while a language of which despite his boasted erudition he was deplorably ignorant i knew who he was i must tell you as i know most of his craft and had long been aware of him as one of the authorised murderers of aspiring genius when i got him on the mauvais pas i saw that he was seized with vertigo i held him firmly by the arm and addressed him in sound strong english thusmr mcwhing you wrote a damnable and scurrilous article against the work of a certain poet and i named the manan article that was a tissue of lies from beginning to end and which by its cruelty and venom embittered a life of brilliant promise and crushed a noble spirit now unless you promise to write and publish in a leading magazine a total recantation of this your crime when you get back to englandif you get backgiving that wronged man the honourable mention he rightly deservesdown you go i have but to loosen my hold geoffrey you should have seen mcwhing then he whined he wriggled he clung never was an oracle of the press in such an unoracular condition murdermurder he gasped but his voice failed him above him towered the snow peaks like the summits of that fame he could not reach and therefore grudged to othersbelow him the glittering icewaves yawned in deep transparent hollows of opaline blue and greenand afar off the tinkling cowbells echoed through the still air suggestive of safe green pastures and happy homes murder he whispered gurglingly nay said i tis i should cry murderfor if ever an arresting hand held a murderer mine holds one now your system of slaying is worse than that of the midnight assassin for the assassin can but kill the bodyyou strive to kill the soul you cannot succeed tis true but the mere attempt is devilish no shouts no struggles will serve you herewe are alone with eternal naturegive the man you have slandered his tardy recognition or else as i said beforedown you go well to make my story short he yielded and swore to do as i bade himwhereupon placing my arm round him as though he were my tender twinbrother i led him safely off the mauvais pas and down the kindlier hill where what with the fright and the remains of vertigo he fell aweeping grievously would you believe it that before we reached chamounix we had become the best friends in the world he explained himself and his rascally modes of action and i nobly exonerated himwe exchanged cardsand when we parted this same authors bugbear mcwhing overcome with sentiment and whisky toddy he is a scotchman you know swore that i was the grandest fellow in the world and that if ever he could serve me he would he knew my princely title by this time but he would have given me a still higher name you are nothica poet yourself he murmured leaning on me fondly as he rolled to bed i told him no i am sorryvery he declared the tears of whisky rising to his eyes if you had been i would have done a great thing for youi would have boomed youfor nothing i left him snoring nobly and saw him no more but i think hell recognize me geoffreyill go and look him up personally by all the godsif he had only known who held him between life and death upon the mauvais pas i stared puzzled but he did knowi saiddid you not say you exchanged cards true but that was afterwards and lucio laughed i assure you my dear fellow we can manage mcwhing i was intensely interested in the story as he told ithe had such a dramatic way of speaking and looking while his very gestures brought the whole scene vividly before me like a picture i spoke out my thought impulsively you would certainly have made a superb actor lucio how do you know i am not one he asked with a flashing glance then he added quicklynothere is no occasion to paint the face and prance over the boards before a row of tawdry footlights like the paid mimes in order to be histrionically great the finest actor is he who can play the comedy of life perfectly as i aspire to do to walk well talk well smile well weep well groan well laugh welland die wellit is all pure actingbecause in every man there is the dumb dreadful immortal spirit who is realwho cannot actwho isand who steadily maintains an infinite though speechless protest against the bodys lie i said nothing in answer to this outbursti was beginning to be used to his shifting humours and strange utterancesthey increased the mysterious attraction i had for him and made his character a perpetual riddle to me which was not without its subtle charm every now and then i realized with a faintly startled sense of selfabasement that i was completely under his dominancethat my life was being entirely guided by his control and suggestionbut i argued with myself that surely it was well it should be so seeing he had so much more experience and influence than i we dined together that night as we often did and our conversation was entirely taken up with monetary and business concerns under lucios advice i was making several important investments and these matters gave us ample subject for discussion at about eleven oclock it being a fine frosty evening and fit for brisk walking we went out our destination being the private gambling club to </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> to which my companion had volunteered to introduce me as a guest it was situated at the end of a mysterious little back street not far from the respectable precincts of pallmall and was an unpretentious looking house enough outside but within it was sumptuously though tastelessly furnished apparently the premises were presided over by a womana woman with painted eyes and dyed hair who received us first of all within the lamplighted splendours of an anglojapanese drawingroom her looks and manner undisguisedly proclaimed her as a demimondaine of the most pronounced typeone of those pure ladies with a past who are represented as such martyrs to the vices of men lucio said something to her apartwhereupon she glanced at me deferentially and smiledthen rang the bell a discreet looking manservant in sober black made his appearance and at a slight sign from his mistress who bowed to me as i passed her proceeded to show us upstairs we trod on a carpet of the softest feltin fact i noticed that everything was rendered as noiseless as possible in this establishment the very doors being covered with thick baize and swinging on silent hinges on the upper landing the servant knocked very cautiously at a sidedoora key turned in the lock and we were admitted into a long double room very brilliantly lit with electric lamps which at a first glance seemed crowded with men playing at rouge et noir and baccarat some looked up as lucio entered and nodded smilinglyothers glanced inquisitively at me but our entrance was otherwise scarcely noticed lucio drawing me along by the arm sat down to watch the playi followed his example and presently found myself infected by the intense excitement which permeated the room like the silent tension of the air before a thunderstorm i recognised the faces of many well known public menmen eminent in politics and society whom one would never have imagined capable of supporting a gambling club by their presence and authority but i took care to betray no sign of surprise and quietly observed the games and the gamesters with almost as impassive a demeanour as that of my companion i was prepared to play and to losei was not prepared however for the strange scene which was soon to occur and in which i by force of circumstances was compelled to take a leading part 2 the author has mr knowless own written authority for this fact x as soon as the immediate game we were watching was finished the players rose and greeted lucio with a good deal of eagerness and effusion i instinctively guessed from their manner that they looked upon him as an influential member of the club a person likely to lend them money to gamble with and otherwise to oblige them in various ways financially speaking he introduced me to them all and i was not slow to perceive the effect my name had upon most of them i was asked if i would join in a game of baccarat and i readily consented the stakes were ruinously high but i had no need to falter for that one of the players near me was a fairhaired young man handsome in face and of aristocratic bearinghe had been introduced to me as viscount lynton i noticed him particularly on account of the reckless way he had of doubling his stakes suddenly and apparently out of mere bravado and when he lost as he mostly did he laughed uproariously as though he were drunk or delirious on first beginning to play i was entirely indifferent as to the results of the game caring nothing at all as to whether i had losses or gains lucio did not join us but sat apart quietly observant and watching me so i fancied more than anyone and as chance would have it all the luck came my way and i won steadily the more i won the more excited i became till presently my humour changed and i was seized by a whimsical desire to lose i suppose it was the touch of some better impulse in my nature that made me wish this for young lyntons sake for he seemed literally maddened by my constant winnings and continued his foolhardy and desperate playhis young face grew drawn and sharply thin and his eyes glittered with a hungry feverishness the other gamesters though sharing in his run of illluck seemed better able to stand it or perhaps they concealed their feelings more cleverlyanyhow i know i caught myself very earnestly wishing that this devils luck of mine would desert me and set in the young viscounts direction but my wishes were no useagain and again i gathered up the stakes till at last the players rose viscount lynton among them well im cleaned out he said with a loud forced laugh you must give me my chance of a revanche tomorrow mr tempest i bowed with pleasure he called a waiter at the end of the room to bring him a brandy and soda and meanwhile i was surrounded by the rest of the men all of them repeating the viscounts suggestion of a revanche and strenuously urging upon me the necessity of returning to the club the next night in order to give them an opportunity of winning back what they had lost i readily agreed and while we were in the midst of talk lucio suddenly addressed young lynton will you make up another game with me he inquired ill start the bank with thisand he placed two crisp notes of five hundred pounds each on the table there was a moments silence the viscount was thirstily drinking his brandyandsoda and glanced over the rim of his tall tumbler at the notes with covetous bloodshot eyesthen he shrugged his shoulders indifferently i cant stake anything he said ive already told you im cleaned outstonybroke as the slang goes its no use my joining sit down sit down lynton urged one man near him ill lend you enough to go on with thanks id rather not he returned flushing a little im too much in your debt already awfully good of you all the same you go on you fellows and ill watch the play let me persuade you viscount lynton said lucio looking at him with his dazzling inscrutable smilejust for the fun of the thing if you do not feel justified in staking money stake something trifling and merely nominal for the sake of seeing whether the luck will turnand here he took up a counterthis frequently represents fifty poundslet it represent for once something that is not valuable like moneyyour soul for example a burst of laughter broke from all the men lucio laughed softly with them we all have i hope enough instruction in modern science to be aware that there is no such thing as a soul in existencehe continued therefore in proposing it as a stake for this game at baccarat i really propose less than one hair of your head because the hair is a something and the soul is a nothing come will you risk that nonexistent quantity for the chance of winning a thousand pounds the viscount drained off the last drop of brandy and turned upon us his eyes flushing mingled derision and defiance done he exclaimed whereupon the party sat down the game was briefand in its rapid excitement almost breathless six or seven minutes sufficed and lucio rose the winner he smiled as he pointed to the counter which had represented viscount lyntons last stake i have won he said quietly but you owe me nothing my dear viscount inasmuch as you riskednothing we played this game simply for fun if souls had any existence of course i should claim yoursi wonder what i should do with it by the way he laughed goodhumouredly what nonsense isnt itand how thankful we ought to be that we live in advanced days like the present when such silly superstitions are being swept aside by the march of progress and pure reason goodnight tempest and i will give you your full revenge tomorrowthe luck is sure to change by then and you will probably have the victory againgoodnight he held out his handthere was a peculiar melting tenderness in his brilliant dark eyesan impressive kindness in his manner somethingi could not tell whatheld us all for the moment spellbound as if by enchantment and several of the players at other tables hearing of the eccentric stake that had been wagered and lost looked over at us curiously from a distance viscount lynton however professed himself immensely diverted and shook lucios proffered hand heartily you are an awfully good fellow he said speaking a little thickly and hurriedlyand i assure you seriously if i had a soul i should be very glad to part with it for a thousand pounds at the present moment the soul wouldnt be an atom of use to me and the thousand pounds would but i feel convinced i shall win tomorrow i am equally sure you will returned lucio affably in the meantime you will not find my friend here geoffrey tempest a hard creditorhe can afford to wait but in the case of the lost soulhere he paused looking straight into the young mans eyesof course i cannot afford to wait </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> wait the viscount smiled vaguely at this pleasantry and almost immediately afterwards left the club as soon as the door had closed behind him several of the gamesters exchanged sententious nods and glances ruined said one of them in a sottovoce his gambling debts are more than he can ever payadded anotherand i hear he has lost a clear fifty thousand on the turf these remarks were made indifferently as though one should talk of the weatherno sympathy was expressedno pity wasted every gambler there was selfish to the core and as i studied their hardened faces a thrill of honest indignation moved meindignation mingled with shame i was not yet altogether callous or cruelhearted though as i look back upon those days which now resemble a wild vision rather than a reality i know that i was becoming more and more of a brutal egoist with every hour i lived still i was so far then from being utterly vile that i inwardly resolved to write to viscount lynton that very evening and tell him to consider his debt to me cancelled as i should refuse to claim it while this thought was passing through my mind i met lucios gaze fixed steadily upon me he smiledand presently signed to me to accompany him in a few minutes we had left the club and were out in the cold night air under a heaven of frostily sparkling stars standing still for a moment my companion laid his hand on my shoulder tempest if you are going to be kindhearted or sympathetic to undeserving rascals i shall have to part company with you he said with a curious mixture of satire and seriousness in his voicei see by the expression of your face that you are meditating some silly disinterested action of pure generosity now you might just as well flop down on these paving stones and begin saying prayers in public you want to let lynton off his debtyou are a fool for your pains he is a born scoundreland has never seen his way to being anything elsewhy should you compassionate him from the time he first went to college till now he has been doing nothing but live a life of degraded sensualityhe is a worthless rake less to be respected than an honest dog yet some one loves him i daresay i said some one loves him echoed lucio with inimitable disdainbah three ballet girls live on him if that is what you mean his mother loved himbut she is deadhe broke her heart he is no good i tell youlet him pay his debt in full even to the soul he staked so lightly if i were the devil now and had just won the strange game we played tonight i suppose according to priestly tradition i should be piling up the fire for lynton in high gleebut being what i am i say let the man alone to make his own destinylet things take their courseand as he chose to risk everything so let him pay everything we were by this time walking slowly into pall malli was on the point of making some reply when catching sight of a mans figure on the opposite side of the way not far from the marlborough club i uttered an involuntary exclamation why there he is i saidthere is viscount lynton lucios hand closed tightly on my arm you dont want to speak to him now surely no but i wonder where hes going he walks rather unsteadily drunk most probably and lucios face presented the same relentless expression of scorn i had so often seen and marvelled at we paused a moment watching the viscount strolling aimlessly up and down in front of the clubstill all at once he seemed to come to a sudden resolution and stopping short he shouted hansom a silentwheeled smart vehicle came bowling up immediately giving some order to the driver he jumped in the cab approached swiftly in our directionjust as it passed us the loud report of a pistol crashed on the silence good god i cried reeling back a step or twohe has shot himself the hansom stoppedthe driver sprang downclubporters waiters policemen and no end of people starting up from heaven knows where were on the scene on an instanti rushed forward to join the rapidly gathering throng but before i could do so lucios strong arm was thrown round me and he dragged me by main force away keep cool geoffrey he saiddo you want to be called up to identify and betray the club and all its members not while i am here to prevent you check your mad impulses my good fellowthey will lead you into no end of difficulties if the mans dead hes dead and theres an end of it lucio you have no heart i exclaimed struggling violently to escape from his holdhow can you stop to reason in such a case think of it i am the cause of all the mischiefit is my cursed luck at baccarat this evening that has been the final blow to the wretched young fellows fortunesi am convinced of iti shall never forgive myself upon my word geoffrey your conscience is very tender he answered holding my arm still more closely and hurrying me away despite myselfyou must try and toughen it a little if you want to be successful in life your cursed luck you think has caused lyntons death surely it is a contradiction in terms to call luck cursedand as for the viscount he did not need that last game at baccarat to emphasise his ruin you are not to blame and for the sake of the club if for nothing else i do not intend either you or myself to be mixed up in a case of suicide the coroners verdict always disposes of these incidents comfortably in two wordstemporary insanity i shuddered my soul sickened as i thought that within a few yards of us was the bleeding corpse of the man i had so lately seen alive and spoken withand notwithstanding lucios words i felt as if i had murdered him temporary insanityrepeated lucio again as if speaking to himselfall remorse despair outraged honour wasted love together with the scientific modern theory of reasonable nothingnesslife a nothing god a nothingwhen these drive the distracted human unit to make of himself also a nothing temporary insanity covers up his plunge into the infinite with an untruthful pleasantness however after all it is as shakespeare says a mad world i made no answer i was too overcome by my own miserable sensations i walked along almost unconscious of movement and as i stared bewilderedly up at the stars they danced before my sight like fireflies whirling in a mist of miasma presently a faint hope occurred to me perhaps i said he has not really killed himself it may be only an attempt he was a capital shotreturned lucio composedlythat was his one quality he has no principlesbut he was a good marksman i cannot imagine his missing aim it is horrible an hour ago alive and now i tell you lucio it is horrible what is death it is not half so horrible as life lived wronglyhe responded with a gravity that impressed me in spite of my emotion and excitementbelieve me the mental sickness and confusion of a wilfully degraded existence are worse tortures than are contained in the priestly notions of hell come come geoffrey you take this matter too much to heartyou are not to blame if lynton has given himself the happy dispatch it is really the best thing he could dohe was of no use to anybody and he is well out of it it is positively weak of you to attach importance to such a trifle you are only at the beginning of your career well i hope that career will not lead me into any more such tragedies as the one enacted tonighti said passionatelyif it does it will be entirely against my will lucio looked at me curiously nothing can happen to you against your willhe replied i suppose you wish to imply that i am to blame for introducing you to the club my good fellow you need not have gone there unless you had chosen to do so i did not bind and drag you there you are upset and unnervedcome into my room and take a glass of wineyou will feel more of a man afterwards we had by this time reached the hotel and i went with him passively with equal passiveness i drank what he gave me and stood glass in hand watching him with a kind of morbid fascination as he threw off his furlined overcoat and confronted me his pale handsome face strangely set and stern and his dark eyes glittering like cold steel that last stake of lyntons to you i said falteringlyhis soul which he did not believe in and which you do not believe in returned lucio regarding me fixedly why do you now seem to tremble at a mere sentimental idea if fantastic notions such as god the soul and the devil were real facts there would perhaps be cause for trembling but being only the brainsick imaginations of superstitious mankind there is nothing in them to awaken the slightest </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> slightest anxiety or fear but youi beganyou say you believe in the soul i i am brainsick and he laughed bitterlyhave you not found that out yet much learning hath driven me mad my friend science has led me into such deep wells of dark discovery that it is no wonder if my senses sometimes reeland i believeat such insane momentsin the soul i sighed heavily i think i will go to bed i answered i am tired outand absolutely miserable alas poor millionaire said lucio gentlyi am sorry i assure you that the evening has ended so disastrously so am i i returned despondently imagine it he went on dreamily regarding meif my beliefsmy crackbrained theorieswere worth anythingwhich they are noti could claim the only positive existing part of our late acquaintance viscount lynton butwhere and how to send in my account with him if i were satan now i forced a faint smile you would have cause to rejoice i said he moved two paces towards me and laid his hands gently on my shoulders no geoffreyand his rich voice had a strange soft music in itno my friend if i were satan i should probably lamentfor every lost soul would of necessity remind me of my own fall my own despairand set another bar between myself and heaven rememberthe very devil was an angel once his eyes smiled and yet i could have sworn there were tears in them i wrung his hand hardi felt that notwithstanding his assumed coldness and cynicism the fate of young lynton had affected him profoundly my liking for him gained new fervour from this impression and i went to bed more at ease with myself and things in general during the few minutes i spent in undressing i became even able to contemplate the tragedy of the evening with less regret and greater calmnessfor it was certainly no use worrying over the irrevocableand after all what interest had the viscounts life for me none i began to ridicule myself for my own weakness and disinterested emotionand presently being thoroughly fatigued fell sound asleep towards morning however perhaps about four or five oclock i woke suddenly as though touched by an invisible hand i was shivering violently and my body was bathed in a cold perspiration in the otherwise dark room there was something strangely luminous like a cloud of white smoke or fire i started up rubbing my eyesand stared before me for a moment doubting the evidence of my own senses for plainly visible and substantially distinct at a distance of perhaps five paces from my bed stood three figures muffled in dark garments and closely hooded so solemnly inert they wereso heavily did their sable draperies fall about them that it was impossible to tell whether they were men or womenbut what paralysed me with amazement and terror was the strange light that played around and above themthe spectral wandering chill radiance that illumined them like the rays of a faint wintry moon i strove to cry outbut my tongue refused to obey meand my voice was strangled in my throat the three remained absolutely motionlessand again i rubbed my eyes wondering if this were a dream or some hideous optical delusion trembling in every limb i stretched my hand towards the bell intending to ring violently for assistancewhena voice low and thrilling with intense anguish caused me to shrink back appalled and my arm fell nerveless at my side misery the word struck the air with a harsh reproachful clang and i nearly swooned with the horror of it for now one of the figures moved and a face gleamed out from beneath its hooded wrappingsa face white as whitest marble and fixed into such an expression of dreadful despair as froze my blood then came a deep sigh that was more like a deathgroan and again the word misery shuddered upon the silence mad with fear and scarcely knowing what i did i sprang from the bed and began desperately to advance upon these fantastic masqueraders determined to seize them and demand the meaning of this practical and untimely jestwhen suddenly all three lifted their heads and turned their faces on mesuch facesindescribably awful in their pallid agonyand a whisper more ghastly than a shriek penetrated the very fibres of my consciousnessmisery with a furious bound i flung myself upon themmy hands struck empty space yet theredistinct as everthey stood glowering down upon me while my clenched fists beat impotently through and beyond their seemingly corporeal shapes and thenall at oncei became aware of their eyeseyes that watched me pitilessly stedfastly and disdainfullyeyes that like witchfires seemed to slowly burn terrific meanings into my very flesh and spirit convulsed and almost frantic with the strain on my nerves i abandoned myself to despairthis awful sight meant death i thoughtmy last hour had surely come theni saw the lips of one of those dreadful faces move some superhuman instinct in me leaped to life in some strange way i thought i knew or guessed the horror of what that next utterance would be and with all my remaining force i cried out no no not that eternal doom not yet fighting the vacant air i strove to beat back those intangible weird shapes that loomed above me withering up my soul with the fixed stare of their angry eyes and with a choking call for help i fell as it were into a pit of darkness where i lay mercifully unconscious xi how the ensuing hours between this horrible episode and full morning elapsed i do not know i was dead to all impressions i woke at last or rather recovered my senses to see the sunlight pouring pleasantly through the halfdrawn curtains at my window and to find myself in bed in as restful a position as though i had never left it was it then merely a vision i had seena ghastly sort of nightmare if so it was surely the most abhorrent illusion ever evolved from dreamland it could not be a question of health for i had never felt better in my life i lay for some time quiescent thinking over the matter with my eyes fixed on that part of the room where those three shapes had seemingly stood but i had lately got into such a habit of cool selfanalysis that by the time my valet brought my early cup of coffee i had decided that the whole thing was a dreadful fantasy born of my own imagination which had no doubt been unduly excited by the affair of viscount lyntons suicide i soon learned that there was no room left for doubt as to that unhappy young noblemans actual death a brief account of it was in the morning papers though as the tragedy had occurred so late at night there were no details a vague hint of money difficulties was thrown out in one journalbut beyond that and the statement that the body had been conveyed to the mortuary there to await an inquest there was nothing said either personal or particular i found lucio in the smokingroom and it was he who first silently pointed out to me the short paragraph headed suicide of a viscount i told you he was a good shot he commented i nodded somehow i had ceased to feel much interest in the subject my emotion of the previous evening had apparently exhausted all my stock of sympathy and left me coldly indifferent absorbed in myself and my own concerns i sat down to talk and was not long before i had given a full and circumstantial account of the spectral illusion which had so unpleasantly troubled me during the night lucio listened smiling oddly that old tokay was evidently too strong for you he said when i had concluded my story did you give me old tokay i responded laughingthen the mystery is explained i was already overwrought and needed no stimulant but what tricks the imagination plays us to be sure you have no idea of the distinct manner in which those three phantoms asserted themselves the impression was extraordinarily vivid no doubt and his dark eyes studied me curiously impressions often are very vivid see what a marvellously real impression this world makes upon us for example ah but then the world is real i answered is it you accept it as such i daresay and things are as they appear to each separate individual no two human beings think alike hence there may be conflicting opinions as to the reality or nonreality of this present world but we will not take unnecessary plunges into the infinite question of what is as contrasted with what appears to be i have some letters here for your consideration you have lately spoken of buying a country estatewhat say you to willowsmere court in warwickshire i have had my eye on that place for youit seems to me just the very thing it is a magnificent old pile part of it dates from elizabeths time it is in excellent repair the grounds are most picturesque the classic river avon winds with rather a broad sweep through the parkand the whole thing with a great part of the furniture included is to be sold for a mere songfifty thousand pounds cash i think you had better </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> better go in for it it would just suit your literary and poetic tastes was it my fancy or had his musical voice the faintest touch of a sneer as he uttered the last words i would not allow myself to think this possible and answered quickly anything you recommend must be worth looking at and ill certainly go and see it the description sounds well and shakespeares country always appeals to me but wouldnt you like to secure it for yourself he laughed not i i live nowhere for long i am of a roving disposition and am never happy tied down to one corner of the earth but i suggest willowsmere to you for two reasonsfirst that it is charming and perfectly appointed secondly that it will impress lord elton considerably if he knows you are going to buy it how so why because it used to be his propertyreturned lucio quietlytill he got into the hands of the jews he gave them willowsmere as security for loans and latterly they have stepped in as owners theyve sold most of the pictures china bricabrac and other valuables by the way have you noticed how the legended god still appears to protect the house of israel particularly the base usurer who is allowed to get the unhappy christian into his clutches nine times out of ten and no remedy drops from heaven the jew always triumphs rather inconsistent isnt it on the part of an equitable deity his eyes flashed strange scorn anon he resumedas a result of lord eltons unfortunate speculations and the jews admirable shrewdness willowsmere as i tell you is in the market and fifty thousand pounds will make you the envied owner of a place worth a hundred thousand we dine at the eltons tonight do we not i asked musingly we do you cannot have forgotten that engagement and lady sibyl so soon surely he answered laughing no i have not forgotteni said at last after a little silence and i will buy this willowsmere i will telegraph instructions to my lawyers at once will you give me the name and address of the agents with pleasure my dear boy and lucio handed me a letter containing the particulars concerning the sale of the estate and other items but are you not making up your mind rather suddenly hadnt you better inspect the property first there may be things you object to if it were a ratinfested barrack i said resolutelyi would still buy it i shall settle the matter at once i wish to let lord elton know this very night that i am the future owner of willowsmere goodand my companion thrust his arm through mine as we left the smokingroom togetheri like your swiftness of action geoffrey it is admirable i always respect determination even if a man makes up his mind to go to hell i honour him for keeping to his word and going there straight as a die i laughed and we parted in high goodhumourhe to fulfil a club engagement i to telegraph precise instructions to my legal friends messrs bentham and ellis for the immediate purchase in my name at all costs risks or inconveniences of the estate known as willowsmere court in the county of warwick that evening i dressed with more than common care giving my man morris almost as much trouble as if i had been a fidgetty woman he waited upon me however with exemplary patience and only when i was quite ready did he venture to utter what had evidently been on his mind for some time excuse me sirhe then observedbut i daresay youve noticed that theres something unpleasantlike about the princes valet amiel well hes rather a downlooking fellow if thats what you meani repliedbut i suppose theres no harm in him i dont know about that siranswered morris severely he does a great many strange things i do assure you downstairs with the servants he goes on something surprising sings and acts and dances too as if he were a whole musichall really i exclaimed in surprisei should never have thought it nor should i sir but its a fact he must be rather an amusing fellow theni continued wondering that my man should take the accomplishments of amiel in such an injured manner oh i dont say anything against his amusingnessand morris rubbed his nose with a doubtful airits all very well for him to cut capers and make himself agreeable if he likesbut its the deceit of him that surprises me sir youd think to look at him that he was a decent sort of dull chap with no ideas beyond his duty but really sir its quite the contrary if youll believe me the language he uses when hes up to his games downstairs is something frightful and he actually swears he learnt it from the gentlemen of the turf sir last night he was play acting and taking off all the fashionable folksthen he took to hypnotisingand upon my word it made my blood run cold why what did he do i asked with some curiosity well sir he took one of the scullerymaids and sat her in a chair and just pointed at her pointed at her and grinned for all the world like a devil out of a pantomime and though she is generally a respectable sober young woman if she didnt get up with a screech and commence dancing round and round like a lunatic while he kept on pointing and presently she got to jumping and lifting her skirts that high that it was positively scandalous some of us tried to stop her and couldnt she was like mad till all at once number twentytwo bell rangthats the princes roomand he just caught hold of her set her down in her chair again and clapped his hands she came to directly and didnt know a bit what shed been doing then twentytwo bell rang again and the fellow rolled up his eyes like a clergyman and said let us pray and off he went i laughed he seems to have a share of humour at anyratei said i should not have thought it of him but do you think these antics of his are mischievous well that scullery girl is very ill todayreplied morris i expect shell have to leave she has what she calls the jumps and none of us dare tell her how she got them no sir believe me or not as you like theres something very queer about that amiel and another thing i want to know is thiswhat does he do with the other servants what does he do with the other servants i repeated bewilderedlywhat on earth do you mean well sir the prince has a chef of his own hasnt he said morris enumerating on his fingersand two personal attendants besides amielquiet fellows enough who help in the waiting then he has a coachman and groom that makes six servants altogether now none of these except amiel are ever seen in the hotel kitchens the chef sends all the meals in from somewhere in a heated receptacleand the two other fellows are never seen except when waiting at table and they dont live in their own rooms all day though they may sleep thereand nobody knows where the carriage and horses are put up or where the coachman and groom lodge certain it is that both they and the chef board out it seems to me very mysterious i began to feel quite unreasonably irritated look here morris i saidtheres nothing more useless or more harmful than the habit of inquiring into other peoples affairs the prince has a right to live as he likes and do as he pleases with his servantsi am sure he pays royally for his privileges and whether his cook lives in or out up in the skies or down in a cellar is no matter of mine he has been a great traveller and no doubt has his peculiarities and probably his notions concerning food are very particular and fastidious but i dont want to know anything about his mnage if you dislike amiel its easy to avoid him but for goodness sake dont go making mysteries where none exist morris looked up then down and folded one of my coats with special care i saw i had effectually checked his flow of confidence very well sirhe observed and said no more i was rather diverted than otherwise at my servants solemn account of amiels peculiarities as exhibited among his own classand when we were driving to lord eltons that evening i told something of the story to lucio he laughed amiels spirits are often too much for himhe saidhe is a perfect imp of mischief and cannot always control himself why what a wrong estimate i have formed of him i saidi thought he had a peculiarly grave and somewhat sullen disposition you know the trite sayingappearances are deceptive went on my companion lightlyits extremely true the professed humourist is nearly always a disagreeable and heavy man personally as for amiel he is like me in the respect of not being at all what he seems his only fault is a tendency to break the bounds of discipline but otherwise he serves me well and i do </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> do not inquire further is morris disgusted or alarmed neither i think i responded laughinghe merely presents himself to me as an example of outraged respectability ah then you may be sure that when the scullerymaid was dancing he observed her steps with the closest nicety said luciovery respectable men are always particular of inspection into these matters soothe his ruffled feelings my dear geoffrey and tell him that amiel is the very soul of virtue i have had him in my service for a long time and can urge nothing against his character as a man he does not pretend to be an angel his tricks of speech and behaviour are the result of a too constant repression of his natural hilarity but he is really an excellent fellow he dabbled in hypnotic science when he was with me in india i have often warned him of the danger there is in practising this force on the uninitiated buta scullerymaidheavensthere are so many scullerymaids one more or less with the jumps will not matter this is lord eltons the carriage stopped before a handsome house situated a little back from park lane we were admitted by a manservant gorgeous in red plush white silk hose and powdered wig who passed us on majestically to his twinbrother in height and appearance though perhaps a trifle more disdainful in bearing and he in his turn ushered us upstairs with the air of one who should say see to what ignominious degradation a cruel fate reduces so great a man in the drawingroom we found lord elton standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and directly opposite him in a low arm chair reclined an elegantly attired young lady with very small feet i mention the feet because as i entered they were the most prominent part of her person being well stretched out from beneath the wouldbe concealment of sundry flounced petticoats towards the warmth of the fire which the earl rather inconsiderately screened from view there was another lady in the room sitting bolt upright with hands neatly folded on her lap and to her we were first of all introduced when lord eltons own effusive greetings were over charlotte allow memy friends prince lucio rimnezmr geoffrey tempest gentlemen my sisterinlaw miss charlotte fitzroy we bowed the lady gave us a dignified bend of the head she was an imposing looking spinster with a curious expression on her features which was difficult to construe it was pious and prim but it also suggested the idea that she must have seen something excessively improper once in her life and had never been able to forget it the pursedup mouth the round palecoloured eyes and the chronic air of insulted virtue which seemed to pervade her from head to foot all helped to deepen this impression one could not look at miss charlotte long without beginning to wonder irreverently what it was that had in her long past youth so outraged the cleanly proprieties of her nature as to leave such indelible traces on her countenance but i have since seen many english women look so especially among the particularly high bred old and plainfeatured of the upper ten very different was the saucy and bright physiognomy of the younger lady to whom we were next presented and who raising herself languidly from her reclining position smiled at us with encouraging familiarity as we made our salutations miss diana chesneysaid the earl gliblyyou perhaps know her father princeyou must have heard of him at any ratethe famous nicodemus chesney one of the great railwaykings of course i know himresponded lucio warmlywho does not i have met him often a charming man gifted with most remarkable humour and vitalityi remember him perfectly we saw a good deal of each other in washington did you though said miss chesney with a somewhat indifferent interesthes a queer sort of man to my thinking rather a cross between the ticketcollector and customhouse officer combined you know i never see him but what i feel i must start on a journey directlyrailways seem to be written all over him i tell him so i say pa if you didnt carry railwaytracks in your face youd be better looking and you found him humorous did you laughing at the novel and free way in which this young person criticised her parent lucio protested that he did well i dontconfessed miss chesneybut that may be because ive heard all his stories over and over again and ive read most of them in books besidesso theyre not much account to me he tells some of them to the prince of wales whenever he can get a chancebut he dont try them off on me any more hes a real clever man too hes made his pile quicker than most and youre quite right about his vitalitymyhis laugh takes you into the middle of next week her bright eyes flashed merrily as she took a comprehensive survey of our amused faces think im irreverent dont you she went onbut you know pas not a stage parent all dressed out in lovely white hair and benedictionshes just an accommodating railwaytrack and he wouldnt like to be reverenced do sit down wont youthen turning her pretty head coquettishly towards her hostmake them sit down lord eltoni hate to see men standing the superior sex you know besides youre so tall she added glancing with unconcealed admiration at lucios handsome face and figure that its like peering up an appletree at the moon to look at you lucio laughed heartily and seated himself near heri followed his example the old earl still kept his position legs astraddle on the hearthrug and beamed benevolence upon us all certainly diana chesney was a captivating creature one of those surfaceclever american women who distinctly divert mens minds without in the least rousing their passions so youre the famous mr tempest she said surveying me criticallywhy its simply splendid for you isnt it i always say its no use having a heap of money unless youre youngif youre old you only want it to fill your doctors pockets while he tries to mend your poor tuckeredout constitution i once knew an old lady who was left a legacy of a hundred thousand pounds when she was ninetyfive poor old dear she cried over it she just had sense enough to understand what a good time she couldnt have she lived in bed and her only luxury was a halfpenny bun dipped in milk for her tea it was all she cared for a hundred thousand pounds would go a long way in buns i said smiling wouldnt it just and the fair diana laughedbut i guess youll want something a little more substantial for your cash mr tempest a fortune in the prime of life is worth having i suppose youre one of the richest men about just now arent you she put the question in a perfectly nave frank manner and seemed to be unconscious of any undue inquisitiveness in it i may be one of the richesti replied and as i spoke the thought flashed suddenly across me how recently i had been one of the poorestbut my friend here the prince is far richer than i is that so and she stared straight at lucio who met her gaze with an indulgent half satirical smilewell now i guess pas no better than a sort of pauper after all why you must have the world at your feet pretty much soreplied lucio composedlybut then my dear miss chesney the world is so very easily brought to ones feet surely you know that and he emphasized the words by an expressive look of his fine eyes i guess you mean complimentsshe replied unconcernedlyi dont like them as a rule but ill forgive you this once do said lucio with one of his dazzling smiles that caused her to stop for a moment in her voluble chatter and observe him with mingled fascination and wonderment and you too are young like mr tempestshe resumed presently pardon me interrupted lucioi am many years older really exclaimed lord elton at this junctureyou dont look it does he charlotte miss fitzroy thus appealed to raised her elegant tortoiseshellframed glasses to her eyes and peered critically at us both i should imagine the prince to be slightly the senior of mr tempestshe remarked in precise highbred accentsbut only very slightly anyhow resumed miss chesney youre young enough to enjoy your wealth arent you young enough or old enoughjust as you pleasesaid lucio with a careless shrugbut as it happensi do not enjoy it miss chesneys whole aspect now expressed the most lively astonishment what does money do for you went on lucio his eyes dilating with that strange and wistful expression which had often excited my curiositythe world is at your feet perhaps yesbut what a world what a trumpery clod of kickable matter wealth acts merely as a kind of mirror to show you human nature at its worst men skulk and fawn about you and lie twenty times in as many hours in the hope to propitiate you and serve their own interests princes of the blood willingly degrade themselves and their position to borrow cash of youyour intrinsic merit if you have any is thought nothing ofyour </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> ofyour full pockets are your credentials with kings prime ministers and councillors you may talk like a fool laugh like a hyena and look like a baboon but if the chinkchink of your gold be only sufficiently loud you may soon find yourself dining with the queen if such be your ambition if on the contrary you happen to be truly great brave patient and enduring with a spark in you of that genius which strengthens life and makes it better worth livingif you have thoughts which take shape in work that shall endure when kingdoms are swept away like dust before the wind and if with all this you are yet poor in current coin why thenyou shall be spurned by all the crowned dummies of the worldyou shall be snubbed by the affluent starchmaker and the croesus who lives on a patent pillthe tradesman from whom you buy bedsteads and kitchen ware can look down upon you with lordly scorn for does he not by virtue of his wealth alone drive a fourinhand and chat on easy and almost patronizing terms with the prince of wales the wealthy denizens of snobland delight in ignoring natures elected noblemen but supposing said miss chesney quickly you happen to be a natures nobleman yourself and have the advantage of wealth besides surely you must fairly allow that to be rather a good thing mustnt you lucio laughed a little i will retort upon you in your own words fair lady and say i guess you mean compliments what i venture to imply however is that even when wealth does fall to the lot of one of these natures noblemen it is not because of his innate nobility that he wins social distinction it is simply because he is rich that is what vexes me i for example have endless friends who are not my friends so much as the friends of my income they do not trouble to inquire as to my antecedentswhat i am or where i came from is of no importance neither are they concerned in how i live or what i do whether i am sick or well happy or unhappy is equally with them a matter of indifference if they knew more about me it would perhaps be better in the long run but they do not want to knowtheir aims are simple and unconcealedthey wish to make as much out of me and secure as much advantage to themselves by their acquaintance with me as possible and i give them their full waythey get all they wantand more his musical voice lingered with a curiously melancholy impressiveness on the last wordand this time not only miss chesney but we all looked at him as though drawn by some irresistible magnetic spell and for a moment there was silence very few people have any real friendssaid lord elton presently and in that respect i suppose were none of us worse off than socrates who used to keep two chairs only in his house one for myself and another for a friendwhen i find him but you are a universal favourite lucioa most popular fellowand i think youre rather hard on your set people must look after themselves you knoweh lucio bowed his head gravely they must indeed he repliedespecially as the latest news of science is that god has given up the business miss fitzroy looked displeasedbut the earl laughed uproariously at that moment a step was heard outside approaching the open doorway of the drawingroom and miss chesneys quick ears caught the sound she shook herself out of her reclining attitude instantly and sat erect its sibyl she said with a halflaughing halfapologetic flash of her brown eyes at us alli never can loll before sibyl my heart beat fast as the woman whom poets might have called the goddess of their dreams but whom i was now disposed to consider as an object of beauty lawfully open to my purchase entered clad in simple white unrelieved by any ornaments save a golden waistbelt of antique workmanship and a knot of violets nestled among the lace at her bosom she looked far lovelier than when i had first seen her at the theatre there was a deeper light in her eyes and a more roseate flush on her cheeks while her smile as she greeted us was positively dazzling something in her presence her movements her manner sent such a tide of passion through me that for a moment my brain whirled in a dizzy maze and despite the cold calculations i had made in my own mind as to the certainty i had of winning her for my wife there was a wondrous charm of delicate dignity and unapproachableness about her that caused me for the moment to feel ashamed and inclined to doubt even the power of wealth to move this exquisite lily of maidenhood from her sequestered peace ah what fools men are how little do we dream of the canker at the hearts of these women lilies that look so pure and full of grace you are late sibyl said her aunt severely am i she responded with languid indifferenceso sorry papa are you an extemporized firescreen lord elton hastily moved to one side rendered suddenly conscious of his selfish monopoly of the blaze are you not cold miss chesney continued lady sibyl in accents of studied courtesywould you not like to come nearer the fire diana chesney had become quite subdued almost timid in fact thankyoushe murmured and her eyes drooped with what might have been called retiring maiden modesty had not miss chesneys qualities soared far beyond that trite description we heard some shocking news this morning mr tempest said lady sibyl looking at lucio rather than at meno doubt you read it in the papersan acquaintance of ours viscount lynton shot himself last night i could not repress a slight start lucio gave me a warning glance and took it upon himself to reply yes i read a brief account of the affairterrible indeed i also knew him slightly did you well he was engaged to a friend of mine went on lady sibyli myself think she has had a lucky escape because though he was an agreeable man enough in society he was a great gambler and very extravagant and he would have run through her fortune very quickly but she cannot be brought to see it in that lightshe is dreadfully upset she had set her heart on being a viscountess i guess said miss chesney demurely with a sly sparkle of her eyesits not only americans who run after titles since ive been over here ive known several real nice girls marry downright mean doughheads just for the sake of being called my lady or your grace i like a title very well myselfbut i also like a man attached to it the earl smothered a chuckling laughlady sibyl gazed meditatively into the fire and went on as though she had not heard of course my friend will have other chancesshe is young and handsomebut i really think apart from the social point of view that she was a little in love with the viscount nonsense nonsense said her father somewhat testily you always have some romantic notion or other in your head sibylone season ought to have cured you of sentimenthahaha she always knew he was a dissolute rascal and she was going to marry him with her eyes wide open to the fact when i read in the papers that he had blown his brains out in a hansom i said bad tastebad taste spoiling a poor cabbys stockintrade to satisfy a selfish whim hahabut i thought it was a good riddance of bad rubbish he would have made any womans life utterly miserable no doubt he would responded lady sibyl listlessly but all the same there is such a thing as love sometimes she raised her beautiful liquid eyes to lucios face but he was not looking her way and her stedfast gaze met mine instead what my looks expressed i know not but i saw the rich blood mantle warmly in her cheeks and a tremor seemed to pass through her framethen she grew very pale at that moment one of the gorgeous footmen appeared at the doorway dinner is served my lud good and the earl proceeded to pair us all prince will you take miss fitzroymr tempest my daughter falls to your escorti will follow with miss chesney we set off in this order down the stairs and as i walked behind lucio with lady sibyl on my arm i could not help smiling at the extreme gravity and earnestness with which he was discussing church matters with miss charlotte and the sudden enthusiasm that apparently seized that dignified spinster at some of his remarks on the clergy which took the form of the most affectionate and respectful eulogies and were totally the reverse of the ideas he had exchanged with me on the same subject some spirit of mischief was evidently moving him to have a solemn joke with the highbred lady he escorted and i noted his behaviour with a good deal of inward amusement then you know the dear canon i heard miss charlotte say most intimately replied lucio with fervourand i assure you i am thankful </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> thankful to have the privilege of knowing him a truly perfect manalmost a saintif not quite so pureminded sighed the spinster so free from every taint of hypocrisy murmured lucio with intense gravity ah yes yes indeed and so here they passed into the diningroom and i could hear no more i followed with my beautiful partner and in another minute we were all seated at table xii the dinner went on in the fashion of most dinners at great housescommencing with arctic stiffness and formality thawing slightly towards the middle course and attaining to just a pleasant warmth of mutual understanding when ices and dessert gave warning of its approaching close conversation at first flagged unaccountably but afterwards brightened under lucios influence to a certain gaiety i did my best to entertain lady sibyl but found her like most society beauties somewhat of a vague listener she was certainly cold and in a manner irresponsivemoreover i soon decided that she was not particularly clever she had not the art of sustaining or appearing to sustain interest in any one subject on the contrary she had like many of her class an irritating habit of mentally drifting away from you into an absorbed reverie of her own in which you had no part and which plainly showed you how little she cared for anything you or anyone else happened to be saying many little random remarks of hers however implied that in her apparently sweet nature there lurked a vein of cynicism and a certain contempt for men and more than once her light words stung my sense of selflove almost to resentment while they strengthened the force of my resolve to win her and bend that proud spirit of hers to the meekness befitting the wife of a millionaire anda genius a genius yesgod help methat is what i judged myself to be my arrogance was twofoldit arose not only from what i imagined to be my quality of brain but also from the knowledge of what my wealth could do i was perfectly positive that i could buy famebuy it as easily as one buys a flower in the marketand i was more than positive that i could buy love in order to commence proving the truth of this i threw out a feeler towards my object i believe i said suddenly addressing the earlyou used to live in warwickshire at willowsmere court did you not lord elton flushed an apoplectic red and swallowed a gulp of champagne hastily yeseryes ier had the place for some timerather a bore to keep upwants quite an army of servants just so i replied with a nod of appreciative comprehensioni presume it will require a considerable domestic retinue i have arranged to purchase it lady sibyls frigid composure was at last disturbedshe looked strangely agitatedand the earl stared till his eyes seemed likely to fall out of his head you you are going to buy willowsmere he ejaculated yes i have wired to my lawyers to settle the matter as quickly as possibleand i glanced at lucio whose steelbright eyes were fixed on the earl with curious intentnessi like warwickshireand as i shall entertain a great deal i think the place will suit me perfectly there was a moments silence miss charlotte fitzroy sighed deeply and the lace bow on her severely parted hair trembled visibly diana chesney looked up with inquisitive eyes and a little wondering smile sibyl was born at willowsmeresaid the earl presently in rather a husky voice a new charm is added to its possession by that knowledgei said gently bowing to lady sibyl as i spokehave you many recollections of the place indeed indeed i have she answered with a touch of something like passion vibrating in her accentsthere is no corner of the world i love so well i used to play on the lawns under the old oaktrees and i always gathered the first violets and primroses that came out on the banks of the avon and when the hawthorn was in full flower i used to make believe that the park was fairyland and i the fairy queen as you were and are interposed lucio suddenly she smiled and her eyes flashedthen she went on more quietly it was all very foolish but i loved willowsmere and love it still and i often saw in the fields on the other side of the river which did not belong to the estate a little girl about my own age playing all by herself and making long daisychains and buttercup ballsa little girl with long fair curls and a sweet baby face i wanted to know her and speak to her but my nurse would never let me because she was supposed to be beneath me lady sibyls lip curled scornfully at this recollection yet she was wellborn she was the orphan child of a very distinguished scholar and gentleman and had been adopted by the physician who attended her mothers deathbed she having no living relatives left to take care of her and shethat little fairhaired girlwas mavis clare as this name was uttered a sort of hush fell on our party as though an angelus had rung and lucio looking across at me with peculiar intentness asked have you never heard of mavis clare tempest i thought a moment before replying yesi had heard the nameconnected with literature in some dim and distant way but i could not remember when or how for i never paid any attention to the names of women who chose to associate themselves with the arts as i had the usual masculine notion that all they did whether in painting music or writing must of necessity be trash and unworthy of comment women i loftily considered were created to amuse mennot to instruct them mavis clare is a geniuslady sibyl said presentlyif mr tempest has not heard of her there is no doubt he will hear i often regret that i never made her acquaintance in those old days at willowsmerethe stupidity of my nurse often rankles in my mind beneath meindeedand how very much she is above me now she still lives down thereher adopted parents are dead and she rents the lovely little house they inhabited she has bought some extra land about it and improved the place wonderfully indeed i have never seen a more ideal poets corner than lily cottage i was silent feeling somewhat in the background on account of my ignorance as to the gifts and the position of the individual they all seemed to recognize as a celebrity of importance rather an odd name mavis isnt iti at last ventured to observe yesbut it suits her wonderfully she sings quite as sweetly as any thrush so she merits her designation what has she done in literature i continued ohonly a novel replied lucio with a smilebut it has a quality unusual to novels it lives i hope tempest that your forthcoming work will enjoy the same vitality here lord elton who had been more or less brooding darkly over his glass of wine ever since i had mentioned my purchase of willowsmere roused himself from his reverie why god bless my soul he exclaimedyou dont mean to tell me you have written a novel mr tempest was it possible he had never noticed all the prominent advertisements of my book in every paper i thought indignantly what do you want to do that for with your immense position he hankers after fame said lucio half kindly half satirically but youve got fame declared the earl emphaticallyeverybody knows who you are by this time ah my dear lord that is not enough for the aspirations of my gifted friendresponded lucio speaking for me his eyes darkening with that mystic shadow of mingled sorrow and scorn which so frequently clouded their lustrous brilliancy he does not particularly care for the immense position that is due to wealth alone because that does not lift him a jot higher than maple of tottenham court road he seeks to soar beyond the furniture manand who shall blame him he would be known for that indescribable quality called geniusfor high thoughts poetry divine instincts and prophetic probings into the heart of humanityin short for the power of the pen which topples down great kingdoms like cardhouses and sticks foolscaps on the heads of kings generally it is the moneyless man or woman who is endowed with this unpurchaseable powerthis independence of action and indifference to opinionthe wealthy seldom do anything but spend or hoard but tempest means to unite for once in his own person the two most strenuously opposed forces in naturegenius and cashor in other words god and mammon lady sibyl turned her head towards methere was a look of doubt and wonder on her beautiful face i am afraidshe said half smiling that the claims of society will take up too much of your time mr tempest to allow you to continue the writing of books i remember you told me the other evening that you were about to publish a novel i suppose you wereoriginally i meanan author by profession a curious sense of anger burned dully within me originally an author was i not one still was i to be given credit for nothing but my bankingbook originally why i had never been </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> been an actual author till nowi had simply been a wandering literary hacka stray super of grub street occasionally engaged to write articles to order on any subject that came uppermost at a starvation rate of pay without any visible prospect of rising from that lowest and dirtiest rung of the literary ladder i felt myself growing red then paleand i saw that lucio was looking at me fixedly i am an author lady sibyli said at lastand i hope i may soon prove my right to be acknowledged as one author is in my opinion a prouder title than king and i do not think any social claims will deter me from following the profession of literature which i look upon as the highest in the world lord elton fidgetted uneasily in his chair but your peoplehe saidyour familyare they literary no members of my family are now livingi answered somewhat stifflymy father was john tempest of rexmoor indeed and the earls face brightened considerablydear me dear me i used to meet him often in the hunting field years ago you come of a fine old stock sirthe tempests of rexmoor are well and honourably known in county chronicles i said nothing feeling a trifle heated in temper though i could not have quite explained why one begins to wondersaid lucio then in his soft smooth accentswhen one is the descendant of a good english county familya distinct cause for prideand moreover has the still more substantial fact of a large fortune to support that high lineage why one should trouble to fight for merely literary honours you are far too modest in your ambitions tempesthighseated as you are upon banknotes and bullion with all the glory of effulgent county chronicles behind you you still stoop to clutch the laurel fie my dear fellow you degrade yourself by this desire to join the company of the immortals his satirical tone was not lost upon the company and i who saw that in his own special way he was defending the claims of literature against those of mere place and money felt soothed and grateful the earl looked a trifle annoyed thats all very fine he saidbut you see it isnt as if mr tempest were driven by necessity to write for his living one may love work for the works sake without any actual necessity for doing iti interposedfor examplethis mavis clare you speak ofis shea womandriven by necessity mavis clare hasnt a penny in the world that she does not earnsaid lord elton grufflyi suppose that if she did not write she would starve diana chesney laughed i guess shes a long way off starvation just nowshe remarked her brown eyes twinklingwhy shes as proud as the proudestdrives in the park in her victoria and pair with the best in the land and knows all the swagger people shes nowhere near grub street i should say i hear shes a splendid business woman and more than a match for the publishers all round well i should rather doubt thatsaid the earl with a chuckle it needs the devil himself to match the publishers you are rightsaid lucioin fact i daresay that in the various phases or transmigrations of the spirit into differing forms of earthy matter the devil should he exist at all has frequently become a publisherand a particularly benevolent publisher tooby way of diversion we all smiled well i should imagine mavis clare to be a match for anybody or anythingsaid lady sibylof course she is not richbut she spends her money wisely and to effective advantage i do not know her personallyi wish i did but i have read her books which are quite out of the common she is a most independent creature too quite indifferent to opinions i suppose she must be extremely plain theni observed plain women always try to do something more or less startling in order to attract the attention denied to their personality truebut that would not apply to miss clare she is pretty and knows how to dress besides such a virtue in literary women exclaimed diana chesneysome of them are such dowdies most people of culture went on lady sibylin our set at any rate are accustomed to look upon miss clare as quite an exception to the usual run of authors she is charming in herself as well as in her books and she goes everywhere she writes with inspirationand always has something so new to say that of course all the critics are down upon her queried lucio oh naturally but we never read reviews nor anyone else i should hopesaid lord elton with a laughexcept the fellows who write them hahaha i call it damned impertinenceexcuse the wordon the part of a newspaper hack to presume to teach me what i ought to read or what i ought to appreciate im quite capable of forming my own judgment on any book that ever was written but i avoid all the confounded new poetsavoid em like poison sirhaha anything but a new poet the old ones are good enough for me why sir these reviewers who give themselves such airs with a pennorth of ink and a pen are mostly halfgrown halfeducated boys who for a couple of guineas a week undertake to tell the public what they think of such and such a book as if anyone cared a jot about their green opinions ridiculousquite ridiculouswhat do they take the public for i wonder editors of responsible journals ought to know better than to employ such young coxcombs just because they can get them cheap at this juncture the butler came up behind his masters chair and whispered a few words the earls brow cloudedthen he addressed his sisterinlaw charlotte lady elton sends word that she will come into the drawingroom tonight perhaps you had better go and see that she is made comfortable and as miss charlotte rose he turned to us sayingmy wife is seldom well enough to see visitors but this evening she feels inclined for a little change and distraction from the monotony of her sickroom it will be very kind of you two gentlemen to entertain hershe cannot speak much but her hearing and sight are excellent and she takes great interest in all that is going on dear dear me and he heaved a short troubled sighshe used to be one of the brightest of women the sweet countess murmured miss chesney with patronizing tendernessshe is quite lovely still lady sibyl glanced at her with a sudden haughty frown which showed me plainly what a rebellious temper the young beauty held in control and i fell straightway more in loveaccording to my idea of lovethan ever i confess i like a woman to have a certain amount of temper i cannot endure your preternaturally amiable female who can find nothing in all the length or breadth of the globe to move her to any other expression than a fatuous smile i love to see the dangerflash in bright eyesthe delicate quiver of pride in the lines of a lovely mouth and the warm flush of indignation on fair cheeks it all suggests spirit and untamed will and rouses in a man the love of mastery that is born in his nature urging him to conquer and subdue that which seems unconquerable and all the desire of such conquest was strong within me when at the close of dinner i rose and held the door open for the ladies to pass out of the room as the fair sibyl went the violets she wore at her bosom dropped i picked them up and made my first move may i keep these i said in a low tone her breath came and went quicklybut she looked straight in my eyes with a smile that perfectly comprehended my hidden meaning you may she answered i bowedclosed the door behind her and secreting the flowers returned wellsatisfied to my place at table xiii left with myself and lucio lord elton threw off all reserve and became not only familiar but fawning in his adulation of us both an abject and pitiable desire to please and propitiate us expressed itself in his every look and word and i firmly believe that if i had coolly and brutally offered to buy his fair daughter by private treaty for a hundred thousand pounds that sum to be paid down to him on the day of marriage he would have gladly agreed to sell apart however from his personal covetousness i felt and knew that my projected courtship of lady sibyl would of necessity resolve itself into something more or less of a market bargain unless indeed i could win the girls love i meant to try and do this but i fully realized how difficult nay almost impossible it would be for her to forget the fact of my unhampered and vast fortune and consider me for myself alone herein is one of the blessings of poverty which the poor are frequently too apt to forget a moneyless man if he wins a womans love knows that such love is genuine and untainted by selfinterest but a rich man can never be truly certain of love at all the advantages of a wealthy match are constantly urged upon all marriageable girls by both their parents and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> and friendsand it would have to be a very unsophisticated feminine nature indeed that could contemplate a husband possessing five millions of money without a touch of purely interested satisfaction a very wealthy man can never be sure even of friendshipwhile the highest strongest and noblest kind of love is nearly always denied to him in this way carrying out the fulfilment of those strange but true wordshow hardly shall he that is a rich man enter the kingdom of heaven the heaven of a womans love tried and proved true through disaster and difficultyof her unflinching faithfulness and devotion in days of toil and bitter anguishof her heroic selfabnegation sweetness and courage through the darkest hours of doubt and disappointmentthis bright and splendid side of womans character is reserved by divine ordinance for the poor man the millionaire can indeed wed whomsoever he pleases among all the beauties of the worldhe can deck his wife in gorgeous apparel load her with jewels and look upon her in all the radiance of her richly adorned loveliness as one may look upon a perfect statue or matchless picturebut he can never reach the deeper secrets of her soul or probe the wellsprings of her finer nature i thought this even thus early in the beginning of my admiration for lady sibyl elton though i did not then dwell upon it as i have often done since i was too elated with the pride of wealth to count the possibilities of subtle losses amid so many solid gains and i enjoyed to the full and with a somewhat contemptuous malice the humble prostration of a belted earl before the dazzling mine of practically unlimited cash as represented to him in the persons of my brilliant comrade and myself i took a curious sort of pleasure in patronizing him and addressed him with a protecting air of indulgent kindness whereat he seemed gratified inwardly i laughed as i thought how differently matters would have stood supposing i had been indeed no more than author i might have proved to be one of the greatest writers of the age but if with that i had been poor or only moderately well off this same half bankrupt earl who privately boarded an american heiress for two thousand guineas a year would have deemed it a condescension to so much as invite me to his housewould have looked down upon me from his titled nothingness and perhaps carelessly alluded to me as a man who writeseryeserrather clever i believe and then would have thought no more about me for this very cause as author still though millionaire i took a fantastic pleasure in humiliating his lordship as much as possible and i found the best way to do this was to talk about willowsmere i saw that he winced at the very name of his lost estate and that notwithstanding this he could not avoid showing his anxiety as to my intentions with regard to its occupation lucio whose wisdom and foresight had suggested my becoming the purchaser of the place assisted me in the most adroit fashion to draw him out and to make his character manifest and by the time we had finished our cigars and coffee i knew that the proud earl of elton who could trace his lineage to the earliest days of the crusaders was as ready to bend his back and crawl in the dust for money as the veriest hotelporter expectant of a sovereign tip i had never entertained a high opinion of the aristocracy and on this occasion it was certainly not improved but remembering that the spendthrift nobleman beside me was the father of lady sibyl i treated him on the whole with more respect than his mean and grasping nature deserved on returning to the drawingroom after dinner i was struck by the chill weirdness that seemed to be imparted to it by the addition of lady eltons couch which placed near the fire suggested a black sarcophagus in bulk and outline it was practically a narrow bed on wheels though partially disguised by a silk coverlet draped skilfully so as to somewhat hide its coffinlike shape the extended figure of the paralysed countess herself presented a deathlike rigidity but her face as she turned it towards us on our entrance was undisfigured as yet and distinctly handsome her eyes especially being large clear and almost brilliant her daughter introduced us both in a low tone and she moved her head slightly by way of acknowledgment studying us curiously the while well my dearsaid lord elton briskly this is an unexpected pleasure it is nearly three months since you honoured us with your company how do you feel better she replied slowly yet distinctly her gaze now fixed with wondering intentness on prince rimnez mother found the room rather coldexplained lady sibylso we brought her as near to the fire as possible it is coldand she shiveredi fancy it must be freezing hard where is diana asked the earl looking about in search of that lively young lady miss chesney has gone to her own room to write a letter replied his daughter somewhat frigidlyshe will be back directly at this moment lady elton feebly raised her hand and pointed to lucio who had moved aside to answer some question asked of him by miss charlotte who is that she murmured why mother dear i told yousaid lady sibyl gentlythat is prince lucio rimnez papas great friend the countesss pallid hand still remained lifted as though it were frozen in air what is he the slow voice again inquiredand then the hand dropped suddenly like a dead thing now helena you must not excite yourselfsaid her husband bending over her couch with real or assumed anxiety surely you remember all i have told you about the prince and also about this gentleman mr geoffrey tempest she nodded and her eyes turning reluctantly away from rimnez regarded me fixedly you are a very young man to be a millionairewere her next words uttered with evident difficultyare you married i smiled and answered in the negative her looks wandered from me to her daughters facethen back to me again with a singularly intent expression finally the potent magnetism of lucios presence again attracted her and she indicated him by a gesture ask your friend to come here and speak to me rimnez turned instinctively at her request and with his own peculiar charm and gallant grace of bearing came to the side of the paralysed lady and taking her hand kissed it your face seems familiar to meshe said speaking now as it seemed with greater easehave i ever met you before dear lady you may have done sohe replied in dulcet tones and with a most captivating gentleness of mannerit occurs to me now i think of it that years ago i saw once as a passing vision of loveliness in the heyday of youth and happiness helena fitzroy before she was countess of elton you must have been a mere boya childat that time she murmured faintly smiling not sofor you are still young madame and i am old you look incredulous alas why is it i wonder i may not look the age i am most of my acquaintances spend a great part of their lives in trying to look the age they are not and i never came across a man of fifty who was not proud to be considered thirtynine my desires are more laudableyet honourable eld refuses to impress itself upon my features it is quite a sore point with me i assure you well how old are you really asked lady sibyl smiling at him ah i dare not tell you he answered returning the smile but i ought to explain that in my countings i judge age by the workings of thought and feeling more than by the passing of years thus it should not surprise you to hear that i feel myself oldold as the world but there are scientists who say that the world is young i observed and that it is only now beginning to feel its forces and put forth its vigour such optimistic wiseacres are wrong he answeredthe world is a veritable husk of a planet humanity has nearly completed all its allotted phases and the end is near the end echoed lady sibyldo you believe the world will ever come to an end i do most certainly or to be more correct it will not actually perish but will simply change and the change will not agree with the constitution of its present inhabitants they will call the transformation the day of judgment i should imagine it would be a fine sight the countess gazed at him wonderinglylady sibyl seemed amused i would rather not witness itsaid lord elton gruffly oh why and rimnez looked about with quite a cheerful aira final glimpse of the planet ere we ascend or descend to our future homes elsewhere would be something to remember madamehere he addressed lady elton are you fond of music the invalid smiled gratefully and bent her head in acquiescence miss chesney had just entered the room and heard the question do you play she exclaimed vivaciously touching him on the arm with her fan he bowed i do in an erratic sort of </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> of fashion i also sing music has always been one of my passions when i was very youngages agoi used to imagine i could hear the angel israfel chanting his strophes amid the golden glow of heavenly gloryhimself whitewinged and wonderful with a voice outringing beyond the verge of paradise as he spoke a sudden silence fell upon us all something in his accent touched my heart to a strange sense of sorrow and yearning and the countess of eltons dark eyes languid with long suffering grew soft as though with repressed tears sometimes he continued more lightlyjust at odd momentsi like to believe in paradise it is a relief even to a hardened sinner like myself to fancy that there may exist something in the way of a world better than this one surely sir said miss charlotte fitzroy severelyyou believe in heaven he looked at her and smiled slightly madame forgive me i do not believe in the clerical heaven i know you will be angry with me for this frank confession but i cannot picture the angels in white smocks with goose wings or the deity as a somewhat excitable personage with a beard personally i should decline to go to any heaven which was only a city with golden streets and i should object to a sea of glass resenting it as a want of invention on the part of the creative intelligence butdo not frown dear miss fitzroyi do believe in heaven all the samea different kind of heaveni often see it in my dreams he paused and again we were all silent gazing at him lady sibyls eyes indeed rested upon him with such absorbed interest that i became somewhat irritated and was glad when turning towards the countess once more he said quietly shall i give you some music now madame she murmured assent and followed him with a vaguely uneasy glance as he crossed over to the grand piano and sat down i had never heard him either play or sing in fact so far as his accomplishments went i knew nothing of him as yet except that he was a perfect master of the art of horsemanship with the first few bars he struck i half started from my chair in amazementcould a mere pianoforte produce such soundsor was there some witchery hidden in the commonplace instrument unguessed by any other performer i stared around me bewilderedi saw miss charlotte drop her knitting abstractedlydiana chesney lying lazily back in one corner of the sofa half closed her eyelids in dreamy ecstasylord elton stood near the fire resting one arm on the mantelpiece and shading his fuzzy brows with his handand lady sibyl sat beside her mother her lovely face pale with emotion while on the worn features of the invalided lady there was an expression of mingled pain and pleasure difficult to describe the music swelled into passionate cadencemelodies crossed and recrossed each other like rays of light glittering among green leavesvoices of birds and streams and tossing waterfalls chimed in with songs of love and playful merrimentanon came wilder strains of grief and angry clamour cries of despair were heard echoing through the thunderous noise of some relentless stormfarewells everlastingly shrieked amid sobs of reluctant shuddering agonyand then as i listened before my eyes a black mist gathered slowly and i thought i saw great rocks bursting asunder into flame and drifting islands in a sea of firefaces wonderful hideous beautiful peered at me out of a darkness denser than night and in the midst of this there came a tune complete in sweetness and suggestiona piercing swordlike tune that plunged into my very heart and rankled theremy breath failed memy senses swami felt that i must move speak cry out and implore that this music this horribly insidious music should cease ere i swooned with the voluptuous poison of itwhen with a full chord of splendid harmony that rolled out upon the air like a breaking wave the intoxicating sounds ebbed away into silence no one spokeour hearts were yet beating too wildly with the pulsations roused by that wondrous lyric storm diana chesney was the first to break the spell well that beats everything ive ever heard she murmured tremulously i could say nothingi was too occupied with my own thoughts something in the music had instilled itself into my blood or so i fancied and the clinging subtle sweetness of it moved me to strange emotions that were neither wise nor worthy of a man i looked at lady sibyl she was very paleher eyes were cast down and her hands were trembling on a sudden impulse i rose and went to rimnez where he still sat at the piano his hands dumbly wandering over the keys you are a great masteri saida wonderful performer but do you know what your music suggests he met my fixed gaze shrugged his shoulders and shook his head crime i whisperedyou have roused in me evil thoughts of which i am ashamed i did not think that was possible to so divine an art he smiled and his eyes glittered with the steely brightness of stars on a wintry night art takes its colours from the mind my dear friendhe saidif you discover evil suggestions in my music the evil i fear must be in your own nature or in yours i said quickly or in minehe agreed coldlyi have often told you i am no saint i stood hesitatingly looking at him for one moment his great personal beauty appeared hateful to me though i knew not why then the feeling of distrust and repulsion slowly passed leaving me humiliated and abashed pardon me lucio i murmured regretfullyi spoke in haste but truly your music almost put me in a state of frenzyi never heard anything in the least like it nor isaid lady sibyl who just then moved towards the pianoit was marvellous do you know it quite frightened me i am sorry he answered with a penitent airi know i am quite a failure as a pianisti am not sufficiently restrained as the press men would say a failure good god exclaimed lord elton at this juncturewhy if you played like that in public youd drive everyone frantic with alarm queried lucio laughingor with disgust nonsense you know what i mean very well i have always had a contempt for the piano as an instrument but by jove i never heard such music as yours even in a full orchestra it is extraordinaryit is positively magnificent where in the world did you study in natures conservatoirereplied rimnez lazily my first maestro was an amiable nightingale he singing on a branch of fir when the moon was full explained with liquidnoted patience how to construct and produce a pure roulade cadenza and trilland when i had learned thus far he showed me all the most elaborate methods of applying rhythmic tune to the upward and downward rush of the wind thus supplying me with perfect counterpoint chords i learned from old neptune who was good enough to toss a few of his largest billows to the shore for my special benefit he nearly deafened me with his instructions being somewhat excitable and loudvoicedbut on finding me an apt pupil he drew back his waves to himself with so much delicacy among the pebbles and sand that at once i mastered the secret of playing arpeggi once too i had a finishing lesson from a dreama mystic thing with wild hair and wingsit sang one word in my ears and the word was unpronounceable in mortal speechbut after many efforts i discovered it lurking in the scale of sound the best part of it all was that my instructors asked no fees i think you are a poet as well as a musiciansaid lady sibyl a poet spare memy dear young lady why are you so cruel as to load me with so vile an imputation better be a murderer than a poetone is treated with much more respect and courteous considerationby the press at anyrate the murderers breakfastmenu will be given due place in many of the most estimable journalsbut the poets lack of both breakfast and dinner will be deemed his fitting reward call me a livestock producer a horsebreeder a timbermerchantanything but a poet why even tennyson became an amateur milkman to somewhat conceal and excuse the shame and degradation of writing verse we all laughed well you must admit said lord elton that weve had rather too much of poets lately its no wonder were sick of them and that poetry has fallen into disrepute poets are such a quarrelsome lot tooeffeminate puling unmanly humbugs you are speaking of the newly discovered ones of course said lucioyes they are a weedy collection i have sometimes thought that out of pure philanthropy i would start a bonbon manufactory and employ them to write mottoes for the crackers it would keep them out of mischief and provide them with a little pocketmoney for as matters stand they do not make a farthing by their books but i do not call them poets at allthey are mere rhymers one or two real poets do exist but like the prophets of scripture they are not in society nor can they get their logs rolled by any of their contemporaries they </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> they are not favourites with any set that is why i am afraid my dear friend tempest will never be accepted as the genius he is society will be too fond of him to let him go down into dust and ashes to gather the laurel it is not necessary to go down into dust and ashes for that i said i assure you it is he answered gailypositively imperative the laurel flourishes best soit will not grow in a hothouse at that moment diana chesney approached lady elton would like to hear you sing prince she saidwill you give us that pleasure do something quite simple you knowit will set our nerves straight after your terribly beautiful music youd hardly believe it perhapsbut i really feel quite unstrung he folded his hands with a droll air of penitence forgive me he said im always as the church service says doing those things i ought not to do miss chesney laughed a trifle nervously oh i forgive you she repliedon condition that you sing i obey and with that he turned again to the piano and playing a strange wild minor accompaniment sang the following stanzas sleep my belovd sleep be patientwe shall keep our secret closely hid beneath the coffinlid there is no other place in earth or air for such a love as ours or such despair and neither hell nor heaven shall care to win our loathd souls rejoicing in their sin sleepfor my hand is sure the cold steel bright and pure strikes through thy heart and mine shedding our blood like wine sins sweetness is too sweet and if the shame of love must be our curse we hurl the blame back on the gods who gave us love with breath and tortured us from passion into death this strange song sung in the most glorious of baritones full and rich and vibrating with power and sweetness had a visibly thrilling effect upon us all again we were struck dumb with surprise and something like fearand again diana chesney broke the silence you call that simple she said half petulantly quite so love and death are the simplest things in the worldreplied luciothe ballad is a mere trifleit is entitled the last lovesong and is supposed to be the utterance of a lover about to kill his mistress and himself such events happen every dayyou know that by the newspapersthey are perfectly commonplace he was interrupted by a sharp clear voice ringing imperatively across the room where did you learn that song xiv it was the paralysed countess who spoke she had managed to partly raise herself on her couch and her face expressed positive terror her husband hurried to her sideand with a curiously cynical smile on his lips rimnez rose from the piano miss charlotte who had sat rigidly upright and silent for some time hastened to attend upon her sister but lady elton was singularly excited and appeared to have gained a sudden access of unnatural vigour go awayim not illshe said impatientlyi feel bettermuch better than i have done for months the music does me good and addressing her husband she addedask your friend to come and sit here by mei want to talk to him he has a magnificent voiceandi know that song he sangi remember reading itin a manuscript albumlong ago i want to know where he found it rimnez here advanced with his gentle tread and courteous bearing and lord elton gave him a chair beside the invalid you are working miracles on my wifehe saidi have not seen her so animated for years and leaving the two to talk he crossed over to where lady sibyl myself and miss chesney were all seated in a group chatting more or less unrestrainedly i have just been expressing the hope that you and your daughter will pay me a visit at willowsmere lord elton i said his brows contracted a little but he forced a smile we shall be delightedhe mumbledwhen do you take possession as soon as it is at all feasiblei repliedi shall wait in town till the next leve is over as both my friend and myself have arranged to be presented ohahyeseryes that is always advisable and its not half such a troublesome business as a drawingroom is for the ladies its soon overand low bodices are not de rigeurhahaha who is your presenter i named a distinguished personage closely connected with the court and the earl nodded a very good manyou could not have a betterhe said complacentlyand this book of yourswhen does it come out next week we must get itwe must certainly get itsaid lord elton assuming interestsybil you must put it down on your library list she assented though as i thought a trifle indifferently on the contrary you must allow me to present it to you i saidit will be a pleasure to me which i hope you will not deny you are very kindshe answered lifting her beautiful eyes to mine as she spokebut the librarian at mudies is sure to send ithe knows i read everything though i confess i never buy any books except those by mavis clare again that womans name i felt annoyed but took care not to show my annoyance i shall be jealous of mavis clare i said playfully most men are she replied quietly you are indeed an enthusiastic partisan of hers i exclaimed somewhat surprised yes i suppose i am i like to see any member of my sex distinguish herself as nobly as she does i have no genius of my own and that is one of the reasons why i honour it so much in other women i was about to make some suitable compliment by way of response to this remark when we were all violently startled from our seats by a most horrible crya gasping scream such as might be wrung from some tortured animal aghast at the sound we stood for a moment inert staring at rimnez who came quickly towards us with an air of grave concern i am afraid he said softlythat the countess is not so wellperhaps you had better go to her another shriek interrupted his words and transfixed with horror we saw lady elton struggling in the throes of some sudden and terrific convulsion her hands beating the air as if she were fighting with an unseen enemy in one second her face underwent such hideous contortions as robbed it of all human semblance and between the agonized pantings of her difficult breath her halfchoked voice could be heard uttering wild cries mercymercyoh godgod tell sibylpraypray to godpray and with that she fell heavily back speechless and unconscious all was instant confusion lady sibyl rushed to her mothers side with miss charlottediana chesney hung back trembling and afraidlord elton sprang to the bell and rang it furiously fetch the doctor he cried to the startled servantlady elton has had another shock she must be taken to her room at once can i be of any service i inquired with a sideglance at rimnez who stood gravely apart a statuesquely composed figure of silence no nothanks all the same and the earl pressed my hand gratefullyshe should not have come downstairsit has been too exciting for her sybil dont look at her my dearit will only unnerve youmiss chesney pray go to your roomcharlotte can do all that is possible as he spoke two of the menservants came in to carry the insensible countess upstairsand as they slowly bore her on her coffinlike couch past me one of them drew the coverlet across her face to conceal it but not so quickly that i could not see the awful change impressed upon itthe indelible horror that was stamped on the drawn featureshorror such as surely never was seen except in a painters idea of some lost soul in torment the eyes were rolled up and fixed in their sockets like balls of glass and in them also was frozen the same frenzied desperate look of fear it was a dreadful faceso dreadful in its ghastly immovableness that i was all at once reminded of my hideous vision of the previous night and the pallid countenances of the three phantoms that had scared me in my sleep lady eltons looks now resembled theirs sickened and appalled i averted my eyes and was glad to see rimnez taking farewell of his host the while he expressed his regret and sympathy with him in his domestic affliction i myself approaching lady sibyl pressed her cold and trembling hand in mine and respectfully kissed it i am deeply sorry i murmuredi wish i could do anything to console you she looked at me with dry calm eyes thankyou but the doctors have always said that my mother would have another shock depriving her of speech it is very sad she will probably live for some years like that i again expressed my sympathy may i come and inquire about you all tomorrow i asked it will be very kind of youshe answered quietly shall i see you if i come i said in a lower tone if you wish itcertainly our eyes met and i knew by instinct that she read my thoughts i pressed her hand again and was not repulsedthen bowing profoundly i left her </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> her to make my adieux to lord elton and miss chesney who seemed terribly upset and frightened miss charlotte fitzroy had left the room in attendance on her sister and she did not return to bid us goodnight rimnez lingered a moment behind me to say another word or two to the earl and when he joined me in the hall and threw on his operacoat he was smiling to himself somewhat singularly an unpleasant end for helena countess of eltonhe said when we were in our brougham driving awayparalysis is perhaps the worst of all the physical punishments that can befall a rapid lady was she rapid wellperhaps rapid is too mild a term but i can find no otherhe answeredwhen she was youngshe is barely fifty nowshe did everything that could be done by woman at her worst and wildest she had scores of loversand i believe one of them cleared off her husbands turfdebtsthe earl consenting gladlyon a rather pressing occasion what disgraceful conduct i exclaimed he looked at me with an expression of cynical amusement think so the upper ten quite condone that sort of thing in their own set nowadays it is all right if a lady has lovers and her husband beams benevolence on the situation what can be said nothing how very tender your conscience is geoffrey i sat silent thinking my companion lit a cigarette and offered me one i took it mechanically without lighting it i made a mistake this eveninghe went oni should not have sung that last lovesong the fact is the words were written by one of her ladyships former admirers a man who was something of a poet in his wayand she had an idea that she was the only person living who had ever seen the lines she wanted to know if i knew the man who composed them and i was able to say that i didvery intimately i was just explaining how it was and why i knew him so well when the distressing attack of convulsions came on and finished our conversation she looked horrible i said the paralysed helen of a modern troy yesher countenance at the last was certainly not attractive beauty combined with wantonness frequently ends in the drawn twitch fixed eye and helpless limbs of lifeindeath it is natures revenge on the outraged bodyand do you know eternitys revenge on the impure soul is extremely similar what do you know about it i said smiling in spite of myself as i looked at his fine face expressive of perfect health and splendid intellectualityyour absurd fancies about the soul are the only traces of folly i discover in you really well i am glad i have something of the fool in my dispositionfoolishness being the only quality that makes wisdom possible i confess i have odd very odd notions about the soul i will excuse them i said laughinggod forgive me in my own insensate blind conceitthe while he regarded me fixedlyin fact i will excuse anything for the sake of your voice i do not flatter you lucioyou sing like an angel dont use impossible comparisonshe repliedhave you ever heard an angel sing yes i answered smilingi havethis very night he turned deadly pale a very open compliment he said forcing a laughand with almost rough haste he suddenly let down the window of the carriage though the night was bitter coldthis vehicle is suffocating melet us have some air see how the stars are shininglike great crown jewelsdeitys regalia hard frost like hard times brings noble works into prominence yonder far off is a star you can hardly perceive red as a cinder at times and again blue as the lightningi can always discover it though many cannot it is algoljudged by superstitious folk to be an evil star i love it chiefly on account of its bad reputationit is no doubt much maligned it may be a cold quarter of hell where weeping spirits sit frozen in ice made of their own congealed tearsor it may be a preparatory school for heavenwho knows yonder too shines venusyour star geoffreyfor you are in love my friendcome confess it are you not i am not surei answered slowlythe phrase in love scarcely describes my present feeling you have dropped thesehe said suddenly picking up a fast fading knot of violets from the floor of the brougham and holding them towards me he smiled as i uttered an exclamation of annoyance they were lady sibyls flowers which i had inadvertently let fall and i saw he knew it i took them from his hand in silence my dear fellow do not try to hide your intentions from your best friendhe said seriously and kindlyyou wish to marry the earl of eltons beautiful daughter and you shall trust mei will do everything i can to promote your desire you will i exclaimed with unconcealed delight for i fully recognised the influence he had over sibyls father i will i promise he answered gravelyi assure you that such a marriage would be one after my own heart ill do all i can for youand i have made many matches in my time my heart beat high with triumphand when we parted that night i wrung his hand fervently and told him i was devoutly grateful to the fates for sending me such a good friend as he was grateful towhom did you say he asked with a whimsical look to the fates are you really they are very ugly sisters i believe perhaps they were your ghostly visitors of last night god forbid i ejaculated ah god never forbids the fulfilment of his own laws he answeredto do so he would have to destroy himself if he exists at all i said carelessly true if and with this we separated to our different quarters in the grand xv after that evening i became a regular and welcome visitor at lord eltons house and was soon on terms of the most friendly intimacy with all the members of his family including even the severely pious miss charlotte fitzroy it was not difficult for me to see that my matrimonial aspirations were suspectedand though the encouragement i received from lady sibyl herself was so slight as to make me doubtful whether after all my hopes of winning her would ever be realized the earl made no secret of his delight at the idea of securing me as a soninlaw such wealth as mine was not to be met with every dayand even had i been a blackleg of the turf or a retired jockey instead of an author i should with five millions at my back have been considered quite as desirable a suitor for the lady sibyls hand rimnez scarcely ever went with me to the eltons now pleading as excuse much pressing business and many social engagements i was not altogether sorry for this greatly as i admired and honoured him his extraordinary physical beauty and fascination of manner were in dangerous contrast to my merely ordinary goodlooking personality and it seemed to me impossible that any woman seeing much of him could be expected to give me the preference all the same i had no fear that he would ever voluntarily become my rivalhis antipathy to women was too deeprooted and sincere for that on this point indeed his feelings were so strong and passionate that i often wondered why the society sirens who eagerly courted his attention remained so blind and unconscious to the chill cynicism that lurked beneath his seeming courtesythe cutting satire that was coupled with apparent compliment and the intensity of hatred that flamed under the assumed expression of admiring homage in his flashing eyes however it was not my business to point out to those who could not or would not see the endless peculiarities of my friends variable disposition i did not pay much heed to them even so far as i myself was concerned for i had grown accustomed to the quick changes he was wont to ring on all the gamut of human feeling and absorbed in my own lifeschemes i did not trouble myself to intimately study the man who had in a couple of months become my fidus achates i was engrossed at the moment in doing all i could to increase the earl of eltons appreciative sense of my value as a man and a millionaire and to this end i paid some of his pressing debts lent him a large sum of money without demanding interest or promise of repayment and stocked his cellar with presents of such rare old wines as he had not been able to afford to purchase for himself for many years thus was confidence easily engendered between us even to that point of affection which displayed itself in his lordships readiness to thrust his arm through mine when we sauntered together down piccadilly and his calling me my dear boy in public never shall i forget the bewildered amazement of the scrubby little editor of a sixpenny magazine who met me face to face thus accompanied in the park one morning that he knew the earl of elton by sight was evident and that he also knew me his apoplectic stare confessed he had pompously refused to even read any of my offered contributions on </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> on the ground that i had no nameand now he would have given a months salary if i had but condescended to recognize him i did not so condescendbut passed him by listening to and laughing with my intended future fatherinlaw who was retailing an extremely ancient joke for my benefit the incident was slight even trumperyyet it put me in a good humour for one of the chiefest pleasures i had out of my wealth was the ability to repay with vengeful interest all the contempt and insult that had beaten me back from every chance of earning a livelihood while i was poor in all my visits to the eltons i never saw the paralysed countess again since the last terrible visitation of her dread disease she had not moved she merely lived and breathedno more lord elton told me that the worst part of her illness at present so far as it affected those who had to attend upon her was the particularly hideous alteration of her face the fact is he said not without a shuddershes dreadful to look atpositively dreadfulno longer human you know she used to be a lovely womannow she is literally frightful her eyes especiallythey are as scared and wild as if she had seen the devil quite an awful expression i assure youand it never alters the doctors can do nothingand of course its very trying for sibyl and everybody i assented sympathetically and realising that a house holding such a figure of living death within it must of necessity be more or less gloomy and depressing to a young and vigorous nature i lost no opportunity of giving lady sibyl whatever slight pleasures were in my power to procure for her distraction and entertainment costly flowers boxes for the opera and first nights at the playevery sort of attention that a man can pay to a woman without being considered officious or intrusive i offered and was not repulsed everything progressed well and favourably towards the easy attainment of my wishesi had no difficulties no troubles of any kindand i voluntarily led a life of selfishly absorbed personal gratification being commended and encouraged therein by a whole host of flatterers and interested acquaintances willowsmere court was mine and every newspaper in the kingdom had commented on the purchase in either servile or spiteful paragraphs my lawyers had warmly congratulated me on the possession of so admirable a property which they in strict accordance with what they conceived to be their duty had personally inspected and approved the place was now in the hands of a firm of decorators and furnishers recommended by rimnez and it was expected to be in perfect order for my habitation in early summer at which time i purposed entertaining a large houseparty of more or less distinguished people meantime what i had once considered would be the great event of my life took placenamely the publication of my book trumpeted forth by the most heraldic advertisements it was at last launched on the uncertain and fluctuating tide of public favour and special advance copies were sent to the office of every magazine and journal in london the day after this was done lucio as i now familiarly called him came in to my room with a mysterious and mischievous air geoffrey he saidim going to lend you five hundred pounds i looked up with a smile what for he held out a cheque towards me glancing at it i saw that the sum he mentioned was filled in and endorsed with his signature but that the name of the person to whom the money was to be made payable had not yet been written well what does it mean it meansreplied hethat i am going to see mr mcwhing this morning i have an appointment with him at twelve you as geoffrey tempest the author of the book mr mcwhing is going to criticise and make a boom of could not possibly put your name to such a cheque it would not be good formit might crop up afterwards and so betray the secrets of the prisonhouse but for me it is another affair i am going to pose as your businessmanyour literary agent who pockets ten per cent of the profits and wants to make a big thing out of you and im going to talk the matter over with the perfectly practical mcwhing who has like every true scot a keen eye for the main chance of course it will be in confidencestrict confidence and he laughedits all a question of business you knowin these commercial days literature has become a trade like everything else and even critics only work for what pays them as indeed why should they not do you mean to tell me mcwhing will take that five hundred i asked dubiously i mean to tell you nothing of the kind i would not put the matter so coarsely for the world this money is not for mcwhingit is for a literary charity indeed i thought you had an idea perhaps of offering a bribe bribe good heavens bribe a critic impossible my good geoffreysuch a thing was never heard ofnever never never and he shook his head and rolled up his eyes with infinite solemnityno no press people never take money for anythingnot even for booming a new goldmining companynot even for putting a notice of a fashionable concert into the morning post everything in the english press is the just expression of pure and lofty sentiment believe me this little cheque is for a charity of which mr mcwhing is chief patronyou see the civil list pensions all go by favour to the wrong persons nowadays to the keeping of lunatic versifiers and retired actresses who never could actthe actual bonafide genius never gets anything out of government and moreover would scorn to take a farthing from that penurious body which grudges him anything higher than a moneyrecognition it is as great an insult to offer a beggarly pension of fifty or a hundred pounds a year to a really great writer as to give him a knighthoodand we cannot fall much lower than to be a knight as knights go the present five hundred pounds will help to relieve certain poor and proud but pressing literary cases known to mcwhing alone his expression at this moment was so extraordinary that i entirely failed to fathom it i have no doubt i shall be able to represent the benevolent and respectable literary agent to perfectionof course i shall insist on my ten per centand he began laughing again but i cant stop to discuss the matter now with youim off i promised mcwhing to be with him at twelve oclock precisely and its now halfpasteleven i shall probably lunch with him so dont wait for me and concerning the five hundred you neednt be in my debt an hour longer than you likeill take a cheque for the money back from you this evening all righti saidbut perhaps the great oracle of the cliques will reject your proposals with scorn if he does then is utopia realizedreplied lucio carefully drawing on his gloves as he spokewheres a copy of your book ahheres onesmelling newly of the press and he slipped the volume into his overcoat pocket allow me before departure to express the opinion that you are a singularly ungrateful fellow geoffrey here am i perfectly devoted to your interestsand despite my princedom actually prepared to pose to mcwhing as your acting manager pro tem and you havent so much as a thankyou to throw at me he stood before me smiling the personification of kindness and good humour i laughed a little mcwhing will never take you for an acting manager or literary agenti saidyou dont look it if i seem churlish im sorrybut the fact is i am disgusted at what he inquired still smiling oh at the humbug of everythingi answered impatiently the stupid farce of it all why shouldnt a book get noticed on its own merits without any appeal to cliquism and influential wirepulling on the press exactly and he delicately flicked a grain of dust off his coat while speakingand why shouldnt a man get received in society on his own merits without any money to recommend him or any influential friend to back him up i was silent the world is as it is madehe went on regarding me fixedlyit is moved by the lowest and pettiest motivesit works for the most trivial ridiculous and perishable aims it is not a paradise it is not a happy family of united and affectionate brethren it is an overpopulated colony of jabbering and quarrelsome monkeys who fancy they are men philosophers in old days tried to teach it that the monkeytype should be exterminated for the growth and encouragement of a nobler racebut they preached in vainthere never were enough real men alive to overcome the swarming majority of the beasts god himself they say came down from heaven to try and set wrong things right and to restore if possible his own defaced image to the general aspect of humanityand even he failed there is very little of god in this worldi said bitterly there is much more devil he smileda musing dreamy smile that transfigured his countenance and made him look like </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> like a fine apollo absorbed in the thought of some new and glorious song no doubt he said after a little pausemankind certainly prefer the devil to any other deitytherefore if they elect him as their representative it is scarcely to be wondered at that he governs where he is asked to govern and yetdo you know geoffreythis devilif there is onecan hardly i think be quite so bad as his detractors say i myself dont believe he is a whit worse than a nineteenthcentury financier i laughed aloud at the comparison after that i saidyou had better go to mcwhing i hope you will tell him that i am the triple essence of all the newest discoveries rolled into one never fear returned lucioive learned all my stockphrases by hearta star of the first magnitude etcive read the athenum till ive got the lingo of the literary auctioneer wellnigh perfect and i believe i shall acquit myself admirably au revoir he was gone and i after a little desultory looking over my papers went out to lunch at arthurs of which club i was now a member on my way i stopped to look in at a booksellers window to see if my immortal production was yet on show it was notand the volume put most conspicuously to the front among all the newest books was one entitled differences by mavis clare acting on a sudden impulse i went in to purchase it has this a good sale i asked as the volume was handed to me the clerk at the counter opened his eyes wide sale he echoedwell i should think sorather why everybodys reading it indeed and i turned over the uncut pages carelesslyi see no allusion whatever to it in the papers the clerk smiled and shrugged his shoulders noand youre not likely to sirhe saidmiss clare is too popular to need reviews besides a large number of the criticsthe logrollers especially are mad against her for her success and the public know it only the other day a man came in here from one of the big newspaper offices and told me he was taking a few notes on the books which had the largest saleswould i tell him which authors works were most in demand i said miss clare took the leadas she doesand he got into a regular rage said hethats the answer ive had all along the line and however true it is its no use to me because i dare not mention it my editor would instantly scratch it outhe hates miss clare a precious editor youve got i said and he looked rather queer theres nothing like journalism sir for the suppression of truth i smiled and went away with my purchase convinced that i had wasted a few shillings on a mere piece of womans trash if this mavis clare was indeed so popular then her work must naturally be of the penny dreadful order for i like many another literary man laboured under the ludicrous inconsistency of considering the public an ass while i myself desired nothing so much as the said asss applause and approvaland therefore i could not imagine it capable of voluntarily selecting for itself any good work of literature without guidance from the critics of course i was wrong the great masses of the public in all nations are always led by some instinctive sense of right that moves them to reject the false and unworthy and select the true completely prepared like most men of my type to sneer and cavil at the book chiefly because it was written by a feminine hand i sat down in a retired corner of the club readingroom and began to cut and skim the pages i had not read many sentences before my heart sank with a heavy sense of fear andjealousythe slow fire of an insidious envy began to smoulder in my mind what power had so gifted this authorthis mere womanthat she should dare to write better than i and that she should force me by the magic of her pen to mentally acknowledge albeit with wrath and shame my own inferiority clearness of thought brilliancy of style beauty of diction all these were hers united to consummate ease of expression and artistic skilland all at once in the very midst of reading such a violent impulse of insensate rage possessed me that i flung the book down dreading to go on with it the potent resistless unpurchaseable quality of geniusah i was not yet so blinded by my own conceit as to be unable to recognize that divine fire when i saw it flashing up from every page as i saw it now but to be compelled to give that recognition to a womans work galled and irritated me almost beyond endurance women i considered should be kept in their places as mens drudges or toysas wives mothers nurses cooks menders of socks and shirts and housekeepers generallywhat right had they to intrude into the realms of art and snatch the laurels from their masters brows if i could but get the chance of reviewing this book i thought to myself savagelyi would misquote misrepresent and cut it to shreds with a joy too great for words this mavis clare unsexed as i at once called her in my own mind simply because she had the power i lackedwrote what she had to say with a gracious charm freedom and innate consciousness of strengtha strength which forced me back upon myself and filled me with the bitterest humiliation without knowing her i hated herthis woman who could win fame without the aid of money and who was crowned so brightly and visibly to the world that she was beyond criticism i took up her book again and tried to cavil at itover one or two dainty bits of poetic simile and sentiment i laughedenviously when i left the club later in the day i took the book with me divided between a curious desire to read it honestly through with justice to it and its author and an impulse to tear it asunder and fling it into the road to be crushed in the mud under rolling cab and cart wheels in this strange humour rimnez found me when at about four oclock he returned from his mission to david mcwhing smiling andtriumphant congratulate me geoffrey he exclaimed as he entered my roomcongratulate me and yourself i am minus the five hundred pound cheque i showed you this morning mcwhing has pocketed it theni said sullenlyall right much good may it do him and his charity rimnez gave me a quick observant glance why what has happened to you since we parted he inquired throwing off his overcoat and sitting down opposite to meyou seem out of temper yet you ought to be a perfectly happy manfor your highest ambition is about to be gratified you said you wished to make your book and yourself the talk of londonwell within the next two or three weeks you will see yourself praised in a very large number of influential newspapers as the newest discovered genius of the day only a little way removed from shakespeare himself three of the big leading magazines are guaranteed to say that and all this through the affability of mr mcwhing and the trifling sum of five hundred pounds and are you not satisfied really my friend you are becoming difficulti warned you that too much good fortune spoils a man with a sudden movement i flung down mavis clares book before him look at thisi saiddoes she pay five hundred pounds to david mcwhings charity he took up the volume and glanced at it certainly not but thenshe gets slanderednot criticized what does that matter i retortedthe man from whom i bought this book says that everybody is reading it exactly and rimnez surveyed me with a curious expression half of pity half of amusementbut you know the old axiom my dear geoffreyyou may lead a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink which statement interpreted for the present occasion means that though certain logrollers headed by our estimable friend mcwhing may drag the horseie the public up to their own particularly prepared literary trough they cannot force it to swallow the mixture the horse frequently turns tail and runs away in search of its own provenderit has done so in the case of miss clare when the public choose an author for themselves it is a dreadful thing of course for other authorsbut it really cant be helped why should they choose mavis clare i demanded gloomily ah why indeed he echoed smilingmcwhing would tell you they do it out of sheer idiotcythe public would answer that they choose her because she has genius genius i repeated scornfullythe public are perfectly incapable of recognizing such a quality you think so he said still smilingyou really think so in that case its very odd isnt it how everything that is truly great in art and literature becomes so widely known and honoured not only in this country but in every civilized land where people think or study you must remember that all the very famous men and women have been steadily written down in their day even to the late english laureate tennyson who was criticized </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> criticized for the most part in the purest billingsgateit is only the mediocrities who are ever written up it seems as if the stupid public really had a hand in selecting these great for the reviewers would never stand them at any price till driven to acknowledge them by the popular force majeure but considering the barbarous want of culture and utter foolishness of the public geoffrey what i wonder at is that you should care to appeal to it at all i sat silentinwardly chafing under his remarks i am afraid he resumed rising and taking a white flower from one of the vases on the table to pin in his buttonholethat miss clare is going to be a thorn in your side my friend a man rival in literature is bad enoughbut a woman rival is too much to endure with any amount of patience however you may console yourself with the certainty that she will never get boomedwhile youthanks to my tender fostering of the sensitive and highprincipled mcwhing will be the one delightful and unique discovery of the press for at least one month perhaps two which is about as long as any new star of the first magnitude lasts in the latterday literary skies shootingstars all of themsuch as poor old forgotten branger sang of les etoiles qui filent qui filentqui filentet disparaissent exceptmavis clare i said true except mavis clare and he laughed alouda

woman the inferior creature and shall the mere spectre of a feminine fame cause a fivefold millionaire to abase his lofty spirit in the dust conquer your strange fit of the spleen geoffrey and join me at dinner he laughed again as he left the roomand again his laughter irritated me when he had gone i gave way to the base and unworthy impulse that had for some minutes been rankling within me and sitting down at my writing table penned a hasty note to the editor of a rather powerful magazine a man whom i had formerly known and worked for he was aware of my altered fortunes and the influential position i now occupied and i felt confident he would be glad to oblige me in any matter if he could my letter marked private and confidential contained the request that i might be permitted to write for his next number an anonymous slashing review of the new novel entitled differences by mavis clare xvi it is almost impossible for me to describe the feverish irritated and contradictory state of mind in which i now began to pass my days with the absolute fixity of my fortunes my humours became more changeful than the wind and i was never absolutely contented for two hours together i joined in every sort of dissipation common to men of the day who with the usual inanity of noodles plunged into the filth of life merely because to be morally dirty was also at the moment fashionable and much applauded by society i gambled recklessly solely for the reason that gambling was considered by many leaders of the upper ten as indicative of manliness and showing grit i hate a fellow who grudges losing a few pounds at playsaid one of these distinguished titled asses to me onceit shows such a cowardly and currish disposition guided by this new morality and wishing to avoid the possibility of being called cowardly and currish i indulged in baccarat and other ruinous games almost every night willingly losing the few pounds which in my case meant a few hundreds for the sake of my occasional winnings which placed a number of noble rakes and blueblooded blacklegs in my power for debts of honour which are supposed to be more strictly attended to and more punctually paid than any debts in the world but which as far as i am concerned are still owing i also betted heavily on everything that could be made the subject of a betand not to be behind my peers in style and knowledge of the world i frequented low houses and allowed a few halfnude brandysoaked dancers and vulgar musichall artistes to get a couple of thousand pounds worth of jewels out of me because this sort of thing was called seeing life and was deemed part of a gentlemans diversion heavenswhat beasts we all were i and my aristocratic boon companionswhat utterly worthless useless callous scoundrelsand yetwe associated with the best and the highest in the landthe fairest and noblest ladies in london received us in their houses with smiles and softlyworded flatterieswewhose presence reeked with vice we young men of fashion whom if he had known our lives as they were an honest cobbler working patiently for daily bread might have spat upon in contempt and indignation that such low rascals should be permitted to burden the earth sometimes but very seldom rimnez joined our gambling and musichall parties and on such occasions i noticed that he as it were let himself go and became the wildest of us all but though wild he was never coarseas we were his deep and mellow laughter had a sonorous richness in it that was totally unlike the donkeys heehaw of our cultured mirthhis manners were never vulgar and his fluent discourse on men and things now witty and satirical now serious almost to pathos strangely affected many of those who heard him talk myself most of all once i remember when we were returning late from some foolish carousei with three young sons of english peers and rimnez walking beside uswe came upon a poorly clad girl sobbing and clinging to the iron railing outside a closed church door oh god she wailedoh dear god do help me one of my companions seized her by the arm with a lewd jest when all at once rimnez stepped between leave her alone he said sternlylet her find god if she can the girl looked up at him terrified her eyes streaming with tears and he dropped two or three gold pieces into her hand she broke out crying afresh oh god bless you she cried wildlygod bless you he raised his hat and stood uncovered in the moonlight his dark beauty softened by a strangely wistful expression i thank you he said simplyyou make me your debtor and he passed on we followed somewhat subdued and silenced though one of my lordling friends sniggered idiotically you paid dearly for that blessing rimnez he saidyou gave her three sovereignsby jove id have had something more than a blessing if i had been you no doubt returned rimnezyou deserve moremuch more i hope you will get it a blessing would be of no advantage whatever to youit is to me how often i have thought of this incident since i was too dense to attach either meaning or importance to it thenselfabsorbed as i was i paid no attention to circumstances which seemed to have no connection with my own life and affairs and in all my dissipations and socalled amusements a perpetual restlessness consumed mei obtained no real satisfaction out of anything except my slow and somewhat tantalizing courtship of lady sibyl she was a strange girl she knew my intentions towards her well enough yet she affected not to know each time i ventured to treat her with more than the usual deference and to infuse something of the ardour of a lover into my looks or manner she feigned surprise i wonder why it is that some women are so fond of playing the hypocrite in love their own instinct teaches them when men are amorous but unless they can run the fox to earth or in other words reduce their suitors to the lowest pitch of grovelling appeal and force them to such abasement that the poor passiondriven fools are ready to fling away life and even honour dearer than life for their sakes their vanity is not sufficiently gratified but who or what am i that i should judge of vanityi whose egregious and flagrant selfapprobation was of such a character that it blinded me to the perception and comprehension of everything in which my own ego was not represented and yetwith all the morbid interest i took in myself my surroundings my comfort my social advancement there was one thing which soon became a torture to mea veritable despair and loathingand this strange to say was the very triumph i had most looked forward to as the crown and summit of all my ambitious dreams my bookthe book i had presumed to consider a work of geniuswhen it was launched on the tide of publicity and criticism resolved itself into a sort of literary monster that haunted my days and nights with its hateful presence the thick blacklettered lying advertisements scattered broadcast by my publisher flared at me with an offensive insistence in every paper i casually opened and the praise of the reviewers the exaggerated preposterous </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> preposterous fraudulent boom good godhow sickening it washow fulsome every epithet of flattery bestowed upon me filled me with disgust and one day when i took up a leading magazine and saw a long article upon the extraordinary brilliancy and promise of my book comparing me to a new schylus and shakespeare combined with the signature of david mcwhing appended to it i could have thrashed that erudite and assuredly purchased scot within an inch of his life the chorus of eulogy was wellnigh universal i was the genius of the daythe hope of the future generationi was the book of the monththe greatest the wittiest most versatile most brilliant scribbling pigmy that had ever honoured a pot of ink by using it of course i figured as mcwhings discoveryfive hundred pounds bestowed on his mysterious charity had so sharpened his eyesight that he had perceived me shining brightly on the literary horizon before anyone else had done so the press followed his lead obedientlyfor though the pressthe english press at leastis distinctly unbribable the owners of newspapers are not insensible to the advantages of largely paying advertisements moreover when mr mcwhing announced me as his find in the oracular style which distinguished him some other literary gentlemen came forward and wrote effective articles about me and sent me their compositions carefully marked i took the hintwrote at once to thank them and invited them to dinner they came and feasted royally with rimnez and myselfone of them wrote an ode to me afterwardsand at the conclusion of the revels we sent two of the oracles home considerably overcome by champagne in a carriage with amiel to look after them and help them out at their own doors and my boom expandedlondon talked as i had said it should the growling monster metropolis discussed me and my work in its own independent and peculiar fashion the upper ten subscribed to the circulating libraries and these admirable institutions made a two or three hundred copies do for all demands by the simple expedient of keeping subscribers waiting five or six weeks till they grew tired of asking for the book and forgot all about it apart from the libraries the public did not take me up from the glowing criticisms that appeared in all the papers it might have been supposed that everybody who was anybody was reading my wonderful production such however was not the case people spoke of me as the great millionaire but they were indifferent to the bid i had made for literary fame the remark they usually made to me wherever i went wasyou have written a novel havent you what an odd thing for you to dothis with a laughi havent read itive so little timei must ask for it at the library of course a great many never did ask not deeming it worth their while and i whose money combined with the resistless influence of rimnez had started the favourable criticisms that flooded the press found out that the majority of the public never read criticisms at all hence my anonymous review of mavis clares book made no effect whatever on her popularity though it appeared in the most prominent manner it was a sheer waste of labourfor everywhere this woman author was still looked upon as a creature of altogether finer clay than ordinary and still her book was eagerly devoured and questioned and admired and still it sold by thousands despite a lack of all favourable criticism or prominent advertisement no one guessed that i had written what i am now perfectly willing to admit was a brutally wanton misrepresentation of her workno one except rimnez the magazine in which it appeared was a notable one circulating in every club and library and he taking it up casually one afternoon turned to that article at once you wrote this he said fixing his eyes upon meit must have been a great relief to your mind i said nothing he read on in silence for a little then laying down the magazine looked at me with a curiously scrutinizing expression there are some human beings so constituted he said that if they had been with noah in the ark according to the silly old legend they would have shot the dove bearing the oliveleaf directly it came in sight over the waste of waters you are of that type geoffrey i do not see the force of your comparison i murmured do you not why what harm has this mavis clare done to you your positions are entirely opposed you are a millionaire she is a hardworking woman dependent on her literary success for a livelihood and you rolling in wealth do your best to deprive her of the means of existence does this redound to your credit she has won her fame by her own brain and energy aloneand even if you dislike her book need you abuse her personally as you have done in this article you do not know her you have never seen her i hate women who write i said vehemently why because they are able to exist independently would you have them all the slaves of mans lust or convenience my dear geoffrey you are unreasonable if you admit that you are jealous of this womans celebrity and grudge it to her then i can understand your spite for jealousy is capable of murdering a fellowcreature with either the dagger or the pen i was silent is the book such wretched stuff as you make it out to be he asked presently i suppose some people might admire iti said curtly i do not this was a lie and of course he knew it was a lie the work of mavis clare had excited my most passionate envywhile the very fact that sibyl elton had read her book before she had thought of looking at mine had accentuated the bitterness of my feelings well said rimnez at last smiling as he finished reading my onslaughtall i can say geoffrey is that this will not touch mavis clare in the least you have overshot the mark my friend her public will simply cry what a shame and clamour for her work more than ever and as for the woman herselfshe has a merry heart and she will laugh at it you must see her some day i dont want to see her i said probably not but you will scarcely be able to avoid doing so when you live at willowsmere court one is not obliged to know everybody in the neighbourhoodi observed superciliously lucio laughed aloud how well you carry your fortunes geoffrey he saidfor a poor devil of a grubstreet hack who lately was at a loss for a sovereign how perfectly you follow the fashions of your time if there is one man more than another that moves me to wondering admiration it is he who asserts his wealth strenuously in the face of his fellows and who comports himself in this world as though he could bribe death and purchase the goodwill of the creator it is such splendid effronterysuch superlative pride now i though overwealthy myself am so curiously constituted that i cannot wear my banknotes in my countenance as it werei have put in a claim for intellect as well as goldand sometimes do you know in my travels round the world i have been so far honoured as to be taken for quite a poor man now you will never have that chance againyou are rich and you look it and you i interrupted him suddenly and with some warmthdo you know what you look you imply that i assert my wealth in my face do you know what you assert in your every glance and gesture i cannot imagine he said smiling contempt for us all i saidimmeasurable contempteven for me whom you call friend i tell you the truth luciothere are times when in spite of our intimacy i feel that you despise me i daresay you do you have an extraordinary personality united to extraordinary talents you must not however expect all men to be as selfrestrained and as indifferent to human passions as yourself he gave me a swift searching glance expect he echoedmy good fellow i expect nothing at allfrom men they on the contraryat least all those i knowexpect everything from me and they get itgenerally as for despising you have i not said that i admire you i do i think there is something positively stupendous in the brilliant progress of your fame and rapid social success my fame i repeated bitterlyhow has it been obtained what is it worth that is not the question he retorted with a little smile how unpleasant it must be for you to have these gouty twinges of conscience geoffrey of course no fame is actually worth much nowadaysbecause it is not classic fame strong in reposeful oldworld dignityit is blatant noisy notoriety merely but yours such as it is is perfectly legitimate judged by its commonsense commercial aspect which is the only aspect in which anyone looks at anything you must bear in mind that no one works out of disinterestedness in the present ageno matter how purely benevolent an action may appear on the surface self lies at the bottom of it once grasp this fact </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> fact and you will perceive that nothing could be fairer or more straightforward than the way you have obtained your fame you have not bought the incorruptible british press you could not do that that is impossible for it is immaculate and bristles stiffly all over with honourable principles there is no english paper existing that would accept a cheque for the insertion of a notice or a paragraph not one his eyes twinkled merrilythen he went onnoit is only the foreign press that is corrupt so the british press saysjohn bull looks on virtuously aghast at journalists who in dire stress of poverty will actually earn a little extra pay for writing something or somebody up or down thank heaven he employs no such journalists his pressmen are the very soul of rectitude and will stoically subsist on a pound a week rather than take ten for a casual job to oblige a friend do you know geoffrey when the judgment day arrives who will be among the first saints to ascend to heaven with the sounding of trumpets i shook my head half vexed half amused all the english not foreign editors and journalists said lucio with an air of pious raptureand why because they are so good so just so unprejudiced their foreign brethren will be reserved for the eternal dance of devils of coursebut the britishers will pace the golden streets singing alleluia i assure you i consider british journalists generally the noblest examples of incorruptibility in the worldthey come next to the clergy as representatives of virtue and exponents of the three evangelical counselsvoluntary poverty chastity and obedience such mockery glittered in his eyes that the light in them might have been the reflection of clashing steel be consoled geoffrey he resumedyour fame is honourably won you have simply through me approached one critic who writes in about twenty newspapers and influences others to write in other twentythat critic being a noble creature all critics are noble creatures has a pet society for the relief of authors in need a noble scheme you will own and to this charity i subscribe out of pure benevolence five hundred pounds moved by my generosity and consideration particularly as i do not ask what becomes of the five hundred mcwhing obliges me in a little matter the editors of the papers for which he writes accept him as a wise and witty personage they know nothing about the charity or the chequeit is not necessary for them to know the whole thing is really quite a reasonable business arrangementit is only a selftormenting analyst like you who would stop to think of such a trifle a second time if mcwhing really and conscientiously admired my book for itself i began why should you imagine he does not asked luciomyself i believe that he is a perfectly sincere and honorable man i think he means all he says and writes i consider that if he had found your work not worthy of his commendation he would have sent me back that cheque for five hundred pounds torn across in a noble scorn and with this throwing himself back in his chair he laughed till the tears came into his eyes but i could not laugh i was too weary and depressed a heavy sense of despair was on my mind i felt that the hope which had cheered me in my days of povertythe hope of winning real fame so widely different a thing to notoriety had vanished there was some quality in the subtle glory which could not be won by either purchase or influence the praise of the press could not give it mavis clare working for her bread had iti with millions of money had not like a fool i had thought to buy it i had yet to learn that all the best greatest purest and worthiest things in life are beyond all marketvalue and that the gifts of the gods are not for sale about a fortnight after the publication of my book we went to court my comrade and i and were presented by a distinguished officer connected with the immediate and intimate surroundings of the royal household it was a brilliant scene enoughbut without doubt the most brilliant personage there was rimnez i was fairly startled at the stately and fascinating figure he made in his court suit of black velvet and steel ornaments accustomed as i was to his good looks i had never seen them so enhanced by dress as on this occasion i had been tolerably well satisfied with my own appearance in the regulation costume till i saw him then my personal vanity suffered a decided shock and i realized that i merely served as a foil to show off and accentuate the superior attractions of my friend but i was not envious of him in any wayon the contrary i openly expressed the admiration i frankly felt he seemed amused my dear boy it is all flunkeydom he saidall sham and humbug look at this and he drew his light court rapier from its sheaththere is no real use in this flimsy bladeit is merely an emblem of dead chivalry in old times if a man insulted you or insulted a woman you admired out flashed a shining point of tempered toledo steel that could lungeso and he threw himself into a fencing attitude of incomparable grace and easeand you pricked the blackguard neatly through the ribs or arm and gave him cause to remember you but now and he thrust the rapier back in its placemen carry toys like these as a melancholy sign to show what bold fellows they were once and what spiritless cravens they are nowrelying no more on themselves for protection but content to go about yelling police police at the least threat of injury to their worthless persons come its time we started geoffreylet us go and bow our heads before another human unit formed precisely like ourselves and so act in defiance of death and the deity who declare all men to be equal we entered our carriage and were soon on our way to st jamess palace his royal highness the prince of wales is not exactly the creator of the universesaid lucio suddenly looking out of the window as we approached the line of soldiery on guard outside why no i answered laughingwhat do you say that for because there is as much fuss about him as if he werein fact more the creator does not get half as much attention bestowed upon him as albert edward we never attire ourselves in any special way for entering the presence of god we dont put so much as a clean mind on but theni said indifferentlygod is non estand albert edward is est he smiledand his eyes had a scornful gleam in their dark centres that is your opinion he queriedwell it is not originalmany choice spirits share it with you there is at least one good excuse for people who make no preparation to enter the presence of godin going to church which is called the house of god they do not find god at all they only discover the clergyman it is somewhat of a disappointment i had no time to reply as just then the carriage stopped and we alighted at the palace through the intervention of the high court official who presented us we got a good place among the most distinguished arrivals and during our brief wait i was considerably amused by the study of their faces and attitudes some of the men looked nervousothers conceited one or two radical notabilities comported themselves with an air as if they and they alone were to be honoured for allowing royalty to hold these functions at all a few gentlemen had evidently donned their leve dress in haste and carelessness for the pieces of tissuepaper in which their steel or gilt coatbuttons had been wrapped by the tailor to prevent tarnish were still unremoved discovering this fortunately before it was too late they occupied themselves by taking off these papers and casting them on the flooran untidy process at best and one that made them look singularly ridiculous and undignified each man present turned to stare at lucio his striking personality attracted universal attention when we at last entered the throneroom and took our places in line i was careful to arrange that my brilliant companion should go up before me as i had a strong desire to see what sort of an effect his appearance would produce on the royal party i had an excellent view of the prince of wales from where i myself waited he made an imposing and kingly figure enough in full uniform with his various orders glittering on his broad breast and the singular resemblance discovered by many people in him to henry viii struck me more forcibly than i should have thought possible his face however expressed a far greater goodhumour than the pictured lineaments of the capricious but ever popular bluff king halthough on this occasion there was a certain shade of melancholy even sternness on his brow which gave a firmer character to his naturally mobile featuresa shadow as i fancied of weariness tempered with regretthe look of one dissatisfied yet resigned a man of blunted possibilities he </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense4> he seemed to meof defeated aims and thwarted will few of the other members of the royal family surrounding him on the das possessed the remarkable attraction he had for any observant student of physiognomymost of them were or assumed to be stiff military figures merely who bent their heads as each guest filed past with an automatic machinelike regularity implying neither pleasure interest nor goodwill but the heirapparent to the greatest empire in the world expressed in his very attitude and looks an unaffected and courteous welcome to allsurrounded as he was and as such in his position must ever be by toadies parasites sycophants hypocritical selfseekers who would never run the least risk to their own lives to serve him unless they could get something personally satisfactory out of it his presence impressed itself upon me as full of the suggestion of dormant but none the less resolute power i cannot even now explain the singular excitation of mind that seized me as our turn to be presented arrivedi saw my companion advance and heard the lord chamberlain announce his nameprince lucio rimnez and thenwhy thenit seemed as if all the movement in the brilliant room suddenly came to a pause every eye was fixed on the stately form and noble countenance of my friend as he bowed with such consummate courtliness and grace as made all other salutations seem awkward by comparison for one moment he stood absolutely still in front of the royal dasfacing the prince as though he sought to impress him with the fact of his presence thereand across the broad stream of sunshine which had been pouring into the room throughout the ceremony there fell the sudden shadow of a passing cloud a fleeting impression of gloom and silence chilled the atmospherea singular magnetism appeared to hold all eyes fixed on rimnez and not a man either going or coming moved this intense hush was brief as it was curious and impressivethe prince of wales started slightly and gazed at the superb figure before him with an expression of eager curiosity and almost as if he were ready to break the frigid bonds of etiquette and speakthen controlling himself with an evident effort he gave his usual dignified acknowledgment of lucios profound reverence whereupon my comrade passed onslightly smiling i followed nextbut naturally made no impression beyond the fact of exciting a smothered whisper from someone among the lesser royalties who caught the name geoffrey tempest and at once murmured the magic words five millionswords which reached my ears and moved me to the usual weary contempt which was with me growing into a chronic malady we were soon out of the palace and while waiting for our carriage in the covered courtyard entrance i touched rimnez on the arm you made a veritable sensation lucio did i he laughed you flatter me geoffrey not at all why did you stop so long in front of the das to please my humour he returned indifferentlyand partly to give his royal highness the chance of remembering me the next time he sees me but he seemed to recognise youi saidhave you met him before his eyes flashed often but i have never till now made a public appearance at st jamess court costume and company manners make a difference to the looks of most menand i doubtyes i very much doubt whether even with his reputed excellent memory for faces the prince really knew me today for what i am xvii it must have been about a week or ten days after the prince of waless leve that i had the strange scene with sibyl elton i am about to relate a scene that left a painful impression on my mind and should have been sufficient to warn me of impending trouble to come had i not been too egotistical to accept any portent that presaged ill to myself arriving at lord eltons house one evening and ascending the stairs to the drawingroom as was now my usual custom unannounced and without ceremony i found diana chesney there alone and in tears why whats the matter i exclaimed in a rallying tone for i was on very friendly and familiar terms with the little americanyou of all people in the world having a private weep has our dear railway papa bust up she laughed a trifle hysterically not just yet you bet she answered lifting her wet eyes to mine and showing that mischief still sparkled brightly in themtheres nothing wrong with the funds as far as i know ive only had awell a sort of rumpus here with sibyl with sibyl yesand she rested the point of her little embroidered shoe on a footstool and looked at it criticallyyou see its the catsups at home tonight and im invited and sibyls invited miss charlotte is knocked up with nursing the countess and of course i made sure that sibyl would go well she never said a word about it till she came down to dinner and then she asked me what time i wanted the carriage i said arent you going too and she looked at me in that provoking way of hersyou knowa look that takes you in from your topmost hair to your shoeedgeand answered did you think it possible well i flared up and said of course i thought it possiblewhy shouldnt it be possible she looked at me in the same way again and saidto the catsups with you now you know mr tempest that was real downright rudeness and more than i could stand so i just gave way to my mind look here i saidthough you are the daughter of an earl you neednt turn up your nose at mrs catsup she isnt half badi dont speak of her moneybut shes a real good sort and has a kind heart which it appears to me is more than you have mrs catsup would never treat me as unkindly as you do and then i chokedi could have burst out in a regular yell if i hadnt thought the footman might be outside the door listening and sibyl only smiled that patent icerefrigerator smile of hers and askedwould you prefer to live with mrs catsup of course i told her nonothing would induce me to live with mrs catsup and then she saidmiss chesney you pay my father for the protection and guarantee of his name and position in english social circles but the companionship of my fathers daughter was not included in the bargain i have tried to make you understand as distinctly as i can that i will not be seen in society with younot because i dislike youfar from itbut simply because people would say i was acting as your paid companion you force me to speak plainly and i am sorry if i offend as for mrs catsup i have only met her once and she seemed to me very common and illbred besides i do not care for the society of tradespeople and with that she got up and sailed outand i heard her order the carriage for me at ten its coming round directly and just look at my red eyes its awfully hard on mei know old catsup made his pile out of varnish but varnish is as good as anything else in the general market andandits all out now mr tempestand you can tell sibyl what ive said if you like i know youre in love with her i stared bewildered by her voluble and almost breathless outburst really miss chesney i began formally oh yes miss chesney miss chesneyits all very well she repeated impatiently snatching up a gorgeous evening cloak which i mutely volunteered to put on an offer she as mutely acceptedim only a girl and it isnt my fault if ive got a vulgar man for a father who wants to see me married to an english nobleman before he diesthats his lookouti dont care about it english noblemen are a ricketty lot in my opinion but ive as good a heart as anyone and i could love sibyl if shed let me but she wont she leads the life of an iceberg and doesnt care a rap for anyone she doesnt care for you you knowi wish she didshed be more human im very sorry for all thisi said smiling into the piquante face of the really sweetnatured girl and gently fastening the jewelled clasp of her cloak at her throatbut you mustnt mind it so much you are a dear little soul dianakind and generous and impulsive and all the rest of itbutwellenglish people are very apt to misunderstand americans i can quite enter into your feelingsstill you know lady sibyl is very proud proud she interruptedmy i guess it must feel something splendid to have an ancestor who was piked through the body on bosworth field and left there for the birds to eat it seems to give a kind of stiffness in the back to all the family ever afterwards shouldnt wonder if the descendants of the birds who ate him felt kinder stuck up about it too i laughedshe laughed with me and was quite herself again if i told you my ancestor was a pilgrim father you wouldnt believe me i expect she said the corners of her mouth dimpling i </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> i should believe anything from your lips i declared gallantly well believe that then swallow it down if you can i cant he was a pilgrim father in the mayflower and he fell on his knees and thanked god as soon as he touched dry land in the true pilgrimfather way but he couldnt hold a candle to the piked man at bosworth here we were interrupted by the entrance of a footman the carriage is waiting miss thanksall right goodnight mr tempestyoud better send word to sibyl you are here lord elton is dining out but sibyl will be at home all the evening i offered her my arm and escorted her to the carriage feeling a little sorry for her as she drove off in solitary state to the festive crush of the successful varnisher she was a good girl a bright girl a true girlvulgar and flippant at times yet on the whole sincere in her better qualities of character and sentimentand it was this very sincerity which being quite unconventional and not at all la mode was misunderstood and would always be misunderstood by the higher and therefore more hypocritically polished circles of english society i returned to the drawingroom slowly and meditatively telling one of the servants on my way to ask lady sibyl if she could see me for a few moments i was not kept waiting long i had only paced the room twice up and down when she entered looking so strangely wild and beautiful that i could scarcely forbear uttering an exclamation of wonder she wore white as was always her custom in the eveningsher hair was less elaborately dressed than usual and clustered over her brow in loose wavy massesher face was exceedingly pale and her eyes appeared larger and darker by comparisonher smile was vague and fleeting like that of a sleepwalker she gave me her hand it was dry and burning my father is out she began i know but i came to see you may i stay a little she murmured assent and sinking listlessly into a chair began to play with some roses in a vase on the table beside her you look tired lady sibyli said gentlyare you not well i am quite well she answeredbut you are right in saying i am tired i am dreadfully tired you have been doing too much perhapsyour attendance on your mother tries you she laughed bitterly attendance on my motherpray do not credit me with so much devotion i never attend on my mother i cannot do it i am too much of a coward her face terrifies me and whenever i do venture to go near her she tries to speak with such dreadful such ghastly efforts as make her more hideous to look at than anyone can imagine i should die of fright if i saw her often as it is when i do see her i can scarcely standand twice i have fainted with the horror of it to think of itthat that living corpse with the fearful fixed eyes and distorted mouth should actually be my mother she shuddered violently and her very lips paled as she spoke i was seriously concerned and told her so this must be very bad for your healthi said drawing my chair closer to herscan you not get away for a change she looked at me in silence the expression of her eyes thrilled me strangelyit was not tender or wistful but fierce passionate and commanding i saw miss chesney for a few moments just nowi resumedshe seemed very unhappy she has nothing to be unhappy about said sibyl coldlyexcept the time my mother takes in dying but she is young she can afford to wait a little for the elton coronet is notmay not this be a mistaken surmise of yours i ventured gentlywhatever her faults i think the girl admires and loves you she smiled scornfully i want neither her love nor her admirationshe saidi have few womenfriends and those few are all hypocrites whom i mistrust when diana chesney is my stepmother we shall still be strangers i felt i was on delicate ground and that i could not continue the conversation without the risk of giving offence where is your friend asked sibyl suddenly apparently to change the subjectwhy does he so seldom come here now rimnez well he is a very queer fellow and at times takes an abhorrence for all society he frequently meets your father at the club and i suppose his reason for not coming here is that he hates women all women she queried with a little smile without exception then he hates me i did not say that i answered quicklyno one could hate you lady sibylbut truly as far as prince rimnez is concerned i expect he does not abate his aversion to womankind which is his chronic malady even for you so he will never marry she said musingly i laughed oh never that you may be quite sure of still playing with the roses near her she relapsed into silence her breath came and went quickly i saw her long eyelashes quiver against the pale roseleaf tint of her cheeksthe pure outline of her delicate profile suggested to my mind one of fra angelicos meditative saints or angels all at once while i yet watched her admiringly she suddenly sprang erect crushing a rose in her handher head thrown back her eyes flashing her whole frame trembling oh i cannot bear it she cried wildlyi cannot bear it i started up astonished and confronted her sibyl oh why dont you speak and fill up the measure of my degradation she went on passionatelywhy dont you tell me as you tell my father your purpose in coming herewhy dont you say to me as you say to him that your sovereign choice has fastened upon methat i am the woman out of all the world you have elected to marry look at me and she raised her arms with a tragic gesture is there any flaw in the piece of goods you wish to purchase this face is deemed worthy of the fashionable photographers pains worthy of being sold for a shilling as one of englands beautiesthis figure has served as a model for the showingoff of many a modistes costume purchased at halfcost on the understanding that i must state to my circle of acquaintance the name of the maker or designerthese eyes these lips these arms are all yours for the buying why do you expose me to the shame of dallying over your bargainby hesitating and considering as to whether after all i am worthy of your gold she seemed seized by some hysterical passion that convulsed her and in mingled amazement alarm and distress i sprang to her and caught her hands in my own sibyl sibyl i saidhushhush you are overwrought with fatigue and excitementyou cannot know what you are saying my darling what do you take me forwhat is all this nonsense in your mind about buying and selling you know i love youi have made no secret of ityou must have seen it in my faceand if i have hesitated to speak it is because i feared your rejection of me you are too good for me sibyltoo good for any mani am not worthy to win your beauty and innocence my love my lovedo not give way in this mannerfor as i spoke she clung to me like a wild bird suddenly cagedwhat can i say to you but that i worship you with all the strength of my lifei love you so deeply that i am afraid to think of it it is a passion i dare not dwell upon sibyli love you too welltoo madly for my own peace i trembled and was silenther soft arms clinging to me robbed me of a portion of my selfcontrol i kissed the rippling waves of her hair she lifted her head and looked up at me her eyes alit with some strange lustre that was not love as much as fearand the sight of her beauty thus yielded as it were to my possession broke down the barriers of restraint i had hitherto imposed upon myself i kissed her on the lipsa long passionate kiss that to my excited fancy seemed to mingle our very beings into onebut while i yet held her in my arms she suddenly released herself and pushed me back standing apart from me she trembled so violently that i feared she would failand i took her hand and made her sit down she smileda very wan smile what did you feel then she asked when sibyl just nowwhen you kissed me all the joys of heaven and fires of hell in a moment i said she regarded me with a curious musing frown strange do you know what i felt i shook my head smiling and pressed my lips on the soft small hand i held nothing she said with a kind of hopeless gesturei assure you absolutely nothing i cannot feel i am one of your modern womeni can only thinkand analyse think and analyse as much as you will my queeni answered playfullyif you will only think you can be happy with me that is all i desire can you be </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> be happy with me she askedwaitdo not answer for a moment till i tell you what i am you are altogether mistaken in me she was silent for some minutes and i watched her anxiously i was always intended for thisshe said slowly at lastthis to which i have now cometo be the property of a rich man many men have looked at me with a view to purchase but they could not pay the price my father demanded pray do not look so distressedwhat i say is quite true and quite commonplaceall the women of the upper classesthe unmarried onesare for sale now in england as utterly as the circassian girls in a barbarian slavemarket i see you wish to protest and assure me of your devotionbut there is no need of thisi am quite sure you love meas much as any man can loveand i am content but you do not know me reallyyou are attracted by my face and formand you admire my youth and innocence which you think i possess but i am not youngi am old in heart and feeling i was young for a little while at willowsmere when i lived among flowers and birds and all the trustful honest creatures of the woods and fieldsbut one season in town was sufficient to kill my youth in meone season of dinners and balls andfashionable novelreading now you have written a book and therefore you must know something about the duties of authorshipof the serious and even terrible responsibility writers incur when they send out to the world books full of pernicious and poisonous suggestion to contaminate the minds that have hitherto been clean and undiseased your book has a noble motive and for this i admire it in many parts though to me it is not as convincing as it might have been it is well written too but i gained the impression while reading it that you were not altogether sincere yourself in the thoughts you strove to inculcateand that therefore you just missed what you should have gained i am sure you are righti said with a wholesome pang of humiliationthe book is worthless as literatureit is only the boom of a season at any rateshe went on her eyes darkening with the intensity of her feelingyou have not polluted your pen with the vileness common to many of the authors of the day i ask you do you think a girl can read the books that are now freely published and that her silly society friends tell her to readbecause it is so dreadfully queerand yet remain unspoilt and innocent books that go into the details of the lives of outcaststhat explain and analyse the secret vices of menthat advocate almost as a sacred duty free love and universal polygamythat see no shame in introducing into the circles of good wives and pureminded girls a heroine who boldly seeks out a man any man in order that she may have a child by him without the degradation of marrying him i have read all those booksand what can you expect of me not innocence surely i despise meni despise my own sexi loathe myself for being a woman you wonder at my fanaticism for mavis clareit is only because for a time her books give me back my selfrespect and make me see humanity in a nobler lightbecause she restores to me if only for an hour a kind of glimmering belief in god so that my mind feels refreshed and cleansed all the same you must not look upon me as an innocent young girl geoffreya girl such as the great poets idealized and sang ofi am a contaminated creature trained to perfection in the lax morals and prurient literature of my day i looked at her in silence pained startled and with a sense of shock as though something indefinably pure and precious had crumbled into dust at my feet she rose and began pacing the room restlessly moving to and fro with a slow yet fierce grace that reminded me against my wish and will of the movement of some imprisoned and savage beast of prey you shall not be deceived in meshe said pausing a moment and eyeing me sombrelyif you marry me you must do so with a full realization of the choice you make for with such wealth as yours you can of course wed any woman you fancy i do not say you could find a girl better than i am i do not think you could in my set because we are all alikeall tarred with the same brush and filled with the same merely sensual and materialistic views of life and its responsibilities as the admired heroines of the society novels we read away in the provinces among the middle classes it is possible you might discover a really good girl of the purest blushrose innocencebut then you might also find her stupid and unentertaining and you would not care for that my chief recommendation is that i am beautifulyou can see that everybody can see thatand i am not so affected as to pretend to be unconscious of the fact there is no sham about my external appearance my hair is not a wigmy complexion is naturalmy figure is not the result of the corsetmakers artmy eyebrows and eyelashes are undyed oh yesyou can be sure that the beauty of my body is quite genuinebut it is not the outward expression of an equally beautiful soul and this is what i want you to understand i am passionate resentful impetuousfrequently unsympathetic and inclined to morbidness and melancholy and i confess i have imbibed consciously or unconsciously that complete contempt of life and disbelief in a god which is the chief theme of nearly all the social teachings of the time she ceasedand i gazed at her with an odd sense of mingled worship and disillusion even as a barbarian might gaze at an idol whom he still loved but whom he could no longer believe in as divine yet what she said was in no way contrary to my own theorieshow then could i complain i did not believe in a god why should i inconsistently feel regret that she shared my unbelief i had involuntarily clung to the oldfashioned idea that religious faith was a sacred duty in womanhood i was not able to offer any reason for this notion unless it was the romantic fancy of having a good woman to pray for one if one had no time and less inclination to pray for ones self however it was evident sibyl was advanced enough to do without superstitious observances she would never pray for meand if we had children she would never teach them to make their first tender appeals to heaven for my sake or hers i smothered a slight sigh and was about to speak when she came up to me and laid her two hands on my shoulders you look unhappy geoffreyshe said in gentler accentsbe consoledit is not too late for you to change your mind i met the questioning glance of her eyesbeautiful lustrous eyes as clear and pure as light itself i shall never change sibyl i answeredi love youi shall always love you but i wish you would not analyse yourself so pitilesslyyou have such strange ideas you think them strange she saidyou should notin these new women days i believe that thanks to newspapers magazines and decadent novels i am in all respects eminently fitted to be a wife and she laughed bitterlythere is nothing in the rle of marriage that i do not know though i am not yet twenty i have been prepared for a long time to be sold to the highest bidder and what few silly notions i had about lovethe love of the poets and idealistswhen i was a dreamy child at willowsmere are all dispersed and ended ideal love is deadand worse than dead being out of fashion carefully instructed as i have been in the worthlessness of everything but money you can scarcely be surprised at my speaking of myself as an object of sale marriage for me is a sale as far as my father is concernedfor you know well enough that however much you loved me or i loved you he would never allow me to marry you if you were not rich and richer than most men i want you to feel that i fully recognize the nature of the bargain struck and i ask you not to expect a girls fresh confiding love from a woman as warped in heart and mind as i am sibyli said earnestlyyou wrong yourself i am sure you wrong yourself you are one of those who can be in the world yet not of it your mind is too open and pure to be sullied even by contact with evil things i will believe nothing you say against your own sweet and noble characterand sibyl let me again ask you not to distress me by this constant harping on the subject of my wealth or i shall be inclined to look upon it as a cursei should love you as much if i were poor oh you might love meshe interrupted me with a strange smilebut you would not dare to say so i </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> i was silent suddenly she laughed and linked her arms caressingly round my neck there geoffrey she saidi have finished my discoursemy bit of ibsenism or whatever other ism affects meand we need not be miserable about it i have said what was in my mind i have told you the truth that in heart i am neither young nor innocent but i am no worse than all my set so perhaps you had better make the best of me i please your fancy do i not my love for you cannot be so lightly expressed sibyl i answered in rather a pained tone never mindit is my humour so to express itshe went oni please your fancy and you wish to marry me well now all i ask is go to my father and buy me at once conclude the bargain and when you have bought medont look so tragic and she laughed againand when you have paid the clergyman and paid the bridesmaids with monogram lockets or brooches and paid the guests with weddingcake and champagne and cleared up all scores with everybody even to the last man who shuts the door of the nuptial broughamwill you take me awayfar away from this placethis house where my mothers face haunts me like a ghost in the darkness where i am tortured by terrors night and daywhere i hear such strange sounds and dream of such ghastly things here her voice suddenly broke and she hid her face against my breastoh yes geoffrey take me away as quickly as possible let us never live in hateful london but at willowsmere i may find some of the old joys thereand some of the happy bygone days touched by the appealing pathos of her accents i pressed her to my heart feeling that she was scarcely accountable for the strange things she said in her evidently overwrought and excitable condition it shall be as you wish my darling i saidthe sooner i have you all to myself the better this is the end of marchwill you be ready to marry me in june yes she answered still hiding her face and now sibyl i went onrememberthere must be no more talk of money and bargaining tell me what you have not yet told methat you love meand would love me even if i were poor she looked up straightly and unflinchingly full into my eyes i cannot tell you thatshe saidi have told you i do not believe in love and if you were poor i certainly should not marry you it would be no use you are frank sibyl it is best to be frank is it not and she drew a flower from the knot at her bosom and began fastening it in my coatgeoffrey what is the good of pretence you would hate to be poor and so should i i do not understand the verb to lovenow and then when i read a book by mavis clare i believe love may exist but when i close the book my belief is shut up with it so do not ask for what is not in me i am willingeven glad to marry you that is all you must expect all i exclaimed with a sudden mingling of love and wrath in my blood as i closed my arms about her and kissed her passionatelyallyou impassive iceflower it is not allyou shall melt to my touch and learn what love isdo not think you can escape its influence you dear foolish beautiful child your passions are asleepthey must wake for you she queried resting her head back against my shoulder and gazing up at me with a dreamy radiance in her lovely eyes for me she laughed oh bid me love and i will loveshe hummed softly under her breath you will you must you shall i said ardently i will be your master in the art of loving it is a difficult art she saidi am afraid it will take a lifetime to complete my training even with my master and a smile still lingered in her eyes giving them a witchlike glamour when i kissed her again and bade her goodnight you will tell prince rimnez the news she said if you wish it of course i wish it tell him at once i should like him to know i went down the stairsshe leaned over the balustrade looking after me goodnight geoffrey she called softly goodnight sibyl be sure you tell prince rimnez her white figure disappeared and i walked out of the house in a chaotic state of mind divided between pride ecstasy and painthe engaged husband of an earls daughterthe lover of a woman who had declared herself incapable of love and destitute of faith xviii looking back through the space of only three years to this particular period of my life i can remember distinctly the singular expression of lucios face when i told him that sibyl elton had accepted me his sudden smile gave a light to his eyes that i had never seen in them beforea brilliant yet sinister glow strangely suggestive of some inwardly suppressed wrath and scorn while i spoke he was to my vexation toying with that uncanny favourite of his the mummyinsectand it annoyed me beyond measure to see the repulsive pertinacity with which the glittering batlike creature clung to his hand women are all alikehe said with a hard laugh when he had heard my newsfew of them have moral force enough to resist that temptation of a rich marriage i was irritated at this it is scarcely fair of you to judge everything by the moneystandardi saidthen after a little pause i added what in my own heart i knew to be a lieshesibylloves me for myself alone his glance flashed over me like lightning ohsets the wind in that quarter why then my dear geoffrey i congratulate you more heartily than ever to conquer the affections of one of the proudest girls in england and win her love so completely as to be sure she would marry you even if you had not a sou to bless yourself withthis is a victory indeedand one of which you may well be proud again and yet again i congratulate you tossing the horrible thing he called his sprite off to fly on one of its slow humming circuits round the room he shook my hand fervently still smilingand ifeeling instinctively that he was as fully aware of the truth as i was namely that had i been a poor author with nothing but what i could earn by my brains the lady sibyl elton would never have looked at me much less agreed to marry mekept silence lest i should openly betray the reality of my position you seehe went on with a cheerful relentlessnessi was not aware that any oldworld romance graced the disposition of one so apparently impassive as your beautiful fiance to love for loves sake only is becoming really an obsolete virtue i thought lady sibyl was an essentially modern woman conscious of her position and the necessity there was for holding that position proudly before the world at all costsand that the pretty pastoral sentiments of poetical phyllises and amandas had no place in her nature i was wrong it seems and for once i have been mistaken in the fair sex here he stretched out his hand to the sprite that now came winging its way back and settled at once on its usual restingplace my friend i assure you if you have won a true womans true love you have a far greater fortune than your millionsa treasure that none can afford to despise his voice softenedhis eyes grew dreamy and less scornfuland i looked at him in some astonishment why lucio i thought you hated women so i do he replied quicklybut do not forget why i hate them it is because they have all the worlds possibilities of good in their hands and the majority of them deliberately turn these possibilities to evil men are influenced entirely by women though few of them will own itthrough women they are lifted to heaven or driven to hell the latter is the favourite course and the one almost universally adopted his brow darkened and the lines round his proud mouth grew hard and stern i watched him for a momentthen with sudden irrelevance i said put that abominable sprite of yours away will you i hate to see you with it what my poor egyptian princess he exclaimed with a laughwhy so cruel to her geoffrey if you had lived in her day you might have been one of her lovers she was no doubt a charming personi find her charming still however to oblige you and here placing the insect in its crystal receptacle he carried it away to the other end of the room then returning towards me slowly he saidwho knows what the sprite suffered as a woman geoffrey perhaps she made a rich marriage and repented it at anyrate i am sure she is much happier in her present condition i have no sympathy with such a ghastly fancyi said abruptlyi only know that she or it is a perfectly loathsome object to me wellsome transmigrated souls are loathsome objects to look athe declared imperturbablywhen they </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> they are deprived of their respectable twolegged fleshly covering it is extraordinary what a change the inexorable law of nature makes in them what nonsense you talk lucio i said impatientlyhow can you know anything about it a sudden shadow passed over his face giving it a strange pallor and impenetrability have you forgottenhe said in deliberately measured accentsthat your friend john carrington when he wrote that letter of introduction i brought from him to you told you in it that in all matters scientific i was an absolute master in these matters scientific you have not tested my skillyet you askhow can i know i answer that i do knowmany things of which you are ignorant do not presume too much on your own intellectual capability my friendlest i prove it naughtlest i demonstrate to you beyond all possibility of consoling doubt that the shreds and strippings of that change you call death are only so many embryos of new life which you must live whether you will or no somewhat abashed by his words and still more by his manner i said pardon mei spoke in haste of coursebut you know my theories most thoroughly and he laughed with an immediate resumption of his old mannerevery man his own theory is the fashionable motto of the hour each little biped tells you that he has his own idea of god and equally his own idea of the devil it is very droll but let us return to the theme of love i feel i have not congratulated you half enoughfor surely fortune favours you singularly out of the teeming mass of vain and frivolous femininity you have secured a unique example of beauty truth and puritya woman who apart from all selfinterest and worldly advantage weds you with five millions for yourself alone the prettiest poem in the world could be made out of such an exquisitely innocent maiden type you are one of the luckiest men alive in fact you have nothing more to wish for i did not contradict him though in my own mind i felt that the circumstances of my engagement left much to be desired i who scoffed at religion wished it had formed part of the character of my future wifei who sneered at sentiment craved for some expression of it in the woman whose beauty attracted my desires however i determinedly smothered all the premonitions of my own conscience and accepted what each day of my idle and useless life brought me without considering future consequences the papers soon had the news that a marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between sibyl only daughter of the earl of elton and geoffrey tempest the famous millionaire not famous author mark youthough i was still being loudly boomed morgeson my publisher could offer me no consolation as to my chances of winning and keeping a steady future fame the tenth edition of my book was announced but we had not actually disposed of more than two thousand copies including a onevolume issue which had been hastily thrust on the market and the work i had so mercilessly and maliciously slateddifferences by mavis clare was in its thirtieth thousand i commented on this with some anger to morgeson who was virtuously aggrieved at my complaint dear me mr tempest you are not the only writer who has been boomed by the press and who nevertheless does not sellhe exclaimedno one can account for the caprices of the public they are entirely beyond the most cautious publishers control or calculation miss clare is a sore subject to many authors besides yourselfshe always takes and no one can help it i sympathize with you in the matter heartily but i am not to blame at any rate the reviewers are all with youtheir praise has been almost unanimous now mavis clares differences though to my thinking a very brilliant and powerful book has been literally cut to pieces whenever it has been noticed at alland yet the public go for her and dont go for you it isnt my fault you see people have got compulsory education now and im afraid they begin to mistrust criticism preferring to form their own independent opinions if this is so of course it will be a terrible thing because the most carefully organized clique in the world will be powerless everything has been done for you that can be done mr tempesti am sure i regret as much as yourself that the result has not been all you expected or desired many authors would not care so much for the public approval the applause of cultured journalism such as you have obtained would be more than sufficient for them i laughed bitterly the applause of cultured journalism i thought i knew something of the way in which such applause was won almost i began to hate my millionsgolden trash that could only secure me the insincere flattery of fairweather friendsand that could not give me famesuch fame as has sometimes been grasped in a moment by a starving and neglected genius who in the very arms of death succeeds in mastering the world one day in a fit of disappointment and petulance i said to lucio you have not kept all your promises my friendyou told me you could give me fame he looked at me curiously did i welland are you not famous no i am merely notorious i retorted he smiled the word fame my good geoffrey traced to its origin means a breaththe breath of popular adulation you have thatfor your wealth but not for my work you have the praise of the reviewers what is that worth everything he answered smilingin the reviewers own opinion i was silent you speak of work he went onnow the nature of work i cannot exactly express because it is a divine thing and is judged by a divine standard one must consider in all work two things first the object for which it is undertaken and secondly the way in which it is performed all work should have a high and unselfish intentwithout this it perishes and is not considered work at allnot at least by the eternal judges invisible if it is work truly and nobly done in every sense of the word it carries with it its own reward and the laurels descend from heaven shaped ready for wearingno earthly power can bestow them i cannot give you that famebut i have secured you a very fair imitation of it i was obliged to acquiesce though more or less moroselywhereat i saw that he was somewhat amused unwilling to incur his contempt i said no more concerning the subject that was the nearest to my heart and wore out many sleepless hours at night in trying to write a new booksomething novel and daring such as should force the public to credit me with a little loftier status than that obtained by the possession of a huge banking account but the creative faculty seemed dead in mei was crushed by a sense of impotence and failure vague ideas were in my brain that would not lend themselves to expression in wordsand such a diseased love of hypercriticism controlled me that after a miserably nervous analysis of every page i wrote i tore it up as soon as it was written thus reducing myself to a state of mind that was almost unbearable early in april i made my first visit to willowsmere having received information from the head of the firm of decorators and furnishers employed there that their work was close on completion and that they would be glad of a visit of inspection from me lucio and i went down together for the day and as the train rushed through a green and smiling landscape bearing us away from the smoke dirt and noise of the restless modern babylon i was conscious of a gradually deepening peace and pleasure the first sight of the place i had recklessly purchased without so much as looking at it filled me with delight and admiration it was a beautiful old house ideally english and suggestive of homehappiness ivy and jessamine clung to its red walls and picturesque gablesthrough the long vista of the exquisitely wooded grounds the silver gleam of the avon river could be discerned twisting in and out like a ribbon tied in true loveknotsthe trees and shrubs were sprouting forth in all their fresh spring beautythe aspect of the country was indescribably bright and soothing and i began to feel as if a burden had been suddenly lifted from my life leaving me free to breathe and enjoy my liberty i strolled from room to room of my future abode admiring the taste and skill with which the whole place had been fitted and furnished down to the smallest detail of elegance comfort and convenience here my sibyl was born i thought with a loverlike tendernesshere she would dwell again as my wife amid the lovely and beloved surroundings of her childhoodand we should be happyyes we should be happy despite all the dull and heartless social doctrines of the modern world in the spacious and beautiful drawingroom i stopped to look out from the windows on the entrancing view of lawn and woodland that stretched before meand as i looked a </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> a warm sense of gratitude and affection filled me for the friend to whose good offices i owed this fair domain turning i grasped him by the hand it is all your doing lucio i saidi feel i can never thank you enough without you i should perhaps never have met sibyli might never have heard of her or of willowsmere and i never could have been as happy as i am today oh you are happy then he queried with a little smilei fancied you were not welli have not been as happy as i expected to be i confessedsomething in my sudden accession to wealth seems to have dragged me down rather than lifted me upit is strange it is not strange at allhe interruptedon the contrary it is very natural as a rule the most miserable people in the world are the rich are you miserable for instance i asked smiling his eyes rested on me with a dark and dreary pathos are you too blind to see that i am he answered his accents vibrating with intense melancholycan you think i am happy does the smile i wearthe disguising smile men put on as a mask to hide their secret agonies from the pitiless gaze of unsympathetic fellowcreaturespersuade you that i am free from care as for my wealthi have never told you the extent of it if i did it might indeed amaze you though i believe it would not now arouse your envy considering that your trifling five millions have not been without effect in depressing your mind but ii could buy up kingdoms and be none the pooreri could throne and unthrone kings and be none the wiseri could crush whole countries under the iron heel of financial speculationi could possess the worldand yet estimate it at no higher value than i do nowthe value of a grain of dust circling through infinity or a soapbubble blown on the wind his brows knittedhis face expressed pride scorn and sorrow there is some mystery about you lucioi saidsome grief or loss that your wealth cannot repairand that makes you the strange being you are one day perhaps you will confide in me he laughed loudlyalmost fiercelyand clapped me heavily on the shoulder i will he saidi will tell you my history and you excellent agnostic as you are shall minister to a mind diseased and pluck out the memory of a rooted sorrow what a power of expression there was in shakespeare the uncrowned but actual king of england not the rooted sorrow alone was to be plucked out but the very memory of it the apparently simple line holds complex wisdom no doubt the poet knew or instinctively guessed the most terrible fact in all the universe and what is that the eternal consciousness of memory he repliedgod can not forgetand in consequence of this his creatures may not i forbore to reply but i suppose my face betrayed my thoughts for the cynical smile i knew so well played round his mouth as he looked at me i go beyond your patience do i not he said laughing againwhen i mention godwho is declared by certain scientists to be nonexistent except as a blind indifferent natural force or atomproduceryou are bored i can see that at a glance pray forgive me let us resume our tour of inspection through this charming abode you will be very difficult to satisfy if you are not a very emperor of contentment herewith a beautiful wife and plenty of cash you can well afford to give fame the goby i may win it yet i said hopefullyin this place i feel i could write something worthy of being written good the divine flutterings of winged thoughts are in your brain apollo grant them strength to fly and now let us have luncheonafterwards we shall have time to take a stroll in the diningroom i found an elegant repast prepared which rather surprised me as i had given no orders having indeed forgotten to do so lucio however had it appeared not forgotten and an advance telegram from him had placed certain caterers at leamington on their mettle with the result that we sat down to a feast as delicate and luxurious as any two epicures could desire now i want you to do me a favour geoffreysaid lucio during our luncheonyou will scarcely need to reside here till after your marriage you have too many engagements in town you spoke of entertaining a big houseparty down herei wouldnt do that if i were youit isnt worth while you would have to get in a staff of servants and leave them all afterwards to their own devices while you are on your honeymoon this is what i proposegive a grand fte here in honour of your betrothal to lady sibyl in mayand let me be the master of the revels i was in the mood to agree to anythingmoreover the idea seemed an excellent one i said so and rimnez went on quickly you understand of course that if i undertake to do a thing i always do it thoroughly and brook no interference with my plans now as your marriage will be the signal for our partingat any rate for a timei should like to show my appreciation of your friendship by organizing a brilliant affair of the kind i suggestand if you will leave it all to me i guarantee you shall hold such a fte as has never been seen or known in england and it will be a personal satisfaction to me if you consent to my proposal my dear fellow i answeredof course i consentwillingly i give you carte blanchedo as you like do all you like it is most friendly and kind of you but when are we to make this sensation you are to be married in june he asked yesin the second week of the month very well the fte shall be held on the twentysecond of maythat will give society time to recover from the effect of one burst of splendour in order to be ready for anothernamely the wedding now we need not talk of this any moreit is settledthe rest devolves on me weve got three or four hours to spare before we take the train back to townsuppose we take a saunter through the grounds i assented to this and accompanied him readily feeling in high spirits and good humour willowsmere and its peaceful loveliness seemed to cleanse my mind of all corroding influencesthe blessed silence of the woods and hills after the rush and roar of town life soothed and cheered me and i walked beside my companion with a light heart and smiling facehappy and filled with a dim religious faith in the blue sky if not in the god beyond it we sauntered through the fair gardens which were now mine and then out through the park into a lovely little lanea true warwickshire lane where the celandines were strewing the grass with their bright gold coinage and the starwort thrust up fairy bouquets of white bloom between buttercups and lover and where the hawthornbuds were beginning to show themselves like minute snowpellets among the glossy young green a thrush warbled melodiouslya lark rose from almost our very feet and flung itself joyously into the sky with a wild outburst of songa robin hopped through a little hole in the hedge to look at us in blithe inquisitiveness as we passed all at once lucio stopped and laid his hand on my shoulderhis eyes had the beautiful melancholy of a faroff longing which i could neither understand nor define listen geoffrey he saidlisten to the silence of the earth while the lark sings have you ever observed the receptive attitude in which nature seems to wait for sounds divine i did not answerthe silence around us was indeed impressivethe warbling of the thrush had ceased and only the larks clear voice pealing overhead echoed sweetly through the stillness of the lane in the clerical heaven went on lucio dreamilythere are no birds there are only conceited human souls braying forth alleluia no flowers are includedno trees only golden streets what a poor and barbarous conception as if a world inhabited by deity would not contain the wonders graces and beauties of all worlds even this little planet is more naturally beautiful than the clerical heaventhat is it is beautiful wherever man is not i protesti have always protestedagainst the creation of man i laughed you protest against your own existence then i said his eyes darkened slowly to a sombre brooding blackness when the sea roars and flings itself in anger on the shore it craves its preymankindit seeks to wash the fair earth clean of the puny insect that troubles the planets peace it drowns the noxious creature when it can with the aid of its sympathizing comrade the wind when the thunder crashes down a second after the lightning does it not seem to you that the very clouds combine in the holy war the war against gods one mistakethe making of humanitythe effort to sweep it out of the universe as one erases a weak expression in an otherwise perfect poem you and i for example are the only discords in todays woodland harmony we are not particularly grateful for </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> for lifewe certainly are not content with itwe have not the innocence of a bird or a flower we have more knowledge you will saybut how can we be sure of that our wisdom came from the devil in the first place according to the legend of the tree of knowledgethe fruit of which taught both good and evil but which still apparently persuades man to evil rather than good and leads him on to a considerable amount of arrogance besides for he has an idea he will be immortal as a god in the hereafterye majestic heavenswhat an inadequately stupendous fate for a grain of worthless dusta dwarfish atom such as he well i have no ideas of immortalityi saidi have told you that often this life is enough for mei want and expect no other aye but if there were another answered lucio fixing me with a steady lookandif you were not asked your opinion about itbut simply plunged headlong into a state of terrible consciousness in which you would rather not be oh come i said impatientlydo not let us theorise i am happy todaymy heart is as light as that of the bird singing in the sky i am in the very best of humours and could not say an unkind word to my worst enemy he smiled is that your humour and he took me by the armthen there could be no better opportunity for showing you this pretty little corner of the worldand walking on a few yards he dexterously turned me down a narrow path leading from the lane and brought me face to face with a lovely old cottage almost buried in the green of the young spring verdure and surrounded by an open fence overgrown with hawthorn and sweetbriarkeep firm hold over your temper geoffreyand maintain the benignant tranquillity of your mindhere dwells the woman whose name and fame you hatemavis clare xix the blood rushed to my face and i stopped abruptly let us go back i said why because i do not know miss clare and do not want to know her literary women are my abhorrencethey are always more or less unsexed you are thinking of the new women i supposebut you flatter themthey never had any sex to lose the selfdegrading creatures who delineate their fictional heroines as wallowing in unchastity and who write freely on subjects which men would hesitate to name are unnatural hybrids of nosex mavis clare is not one of themshe is an oldfashioned young woman mademoiselle derino the dancer is unsexed but you did not object to her on that scoreon the contrary i believe you have shown your appreciation of her talents by spending a considerable amount of cash upon her thats not a fair comparisoni answered hotlymademoiselle derino amused me for a time and was not your rival in art said lucio with a little malicious smilei see stillas far as the question of being unsexed goes i personally consider that a woman who shows the power of her intellect is more to be respected than the woman who shows the power of her legs but men always prefer the legsjust as they prefer the devil to the deity all the same i think as we have time to spare we may as well see this genius genius i echoed contemptuously feminine twaddler then he suggested laughinglet us see this feminine twaddler she will no doubt prove as amusing as mademoiselle derino in her way i shall ring the bell and ask if she is at home he advanced towards the creepercovered porchbut i stood back mortified and sullen determined not to accompany him inside the house if he were admitted suddenly a blithe peal of musical laughter sounded through the air and a clear voice exclaimed oh tricksy you wicked boy take it back directly and apologise lucio peered through the fence and then beckoned to me energetically there she is he whispered there is the dyspeptic sour savage old bluestockingthere on the lawnby heavenshes enough to strike terror into the heart of any manand millionaire i looked where he pointed and saw nothing but a fairhaired woman in a white gown sitting in a low basketchair with a tiny toy terrier on her lap the terrier was jealously guarding a large square dogbiscuit nearly as big as himself and at a little distance off sat a magnificent roughcoated st bernard wagging his feathery tail to and fro with every sign of goodhumour and enjoyment the position was evident at a glancethe small dog had taken his huge companions biscuit from him and had conveyed it to his mistressa canine joke which seemed to be appreciated and understood by all the parties concerned but as i watched the little group i did not believe that she whom i saw was mavis clare that small head was surely never made for the wearing of deathless laurels but rather for a garland of roses sweet and perishable twined by a lovers hand no such slight feminine creature as the one i now looked upon could ever be capable of the intellectual grasp and power of differences the book i secretly admired and wondered at but which i had anonymously striven to quash in its successful career the writer of such a work i imagined must needs be of a more or less strong physique with pronounced features and an impressive personality this butterflything playing with her dog was no type of a bluestocking and i said as much to lucio that cannot be miss clare i saidmore likely a visitoror perhaps the companionsecretary the novelist must be very different in appearance to that frivolous young person in white whose dress is distinctly parisian and who seems to have nothing whatever to do but amuse herself tricksy said the clear voice againtake back the biscuit and apologise the tiny terrier looked round with an innocently abstracted air as if in the earnestness of his own thoughts he had not quite caught the meaning of the sentence tricksy and the voice became more imperativetake it back and apologise with a comical expression of resignation to circumstances tricksy seized the large biscuit and holding it in his teeth with gingerly care jumped from his mistresss knee and trotting briskly up to the st bernard who was still wagging his tail and smiling as visibly as dogs often can smile restored his stolen goods with three short yapping barks as much as to say there take it the st bernard rose in all his majestic bulk and sniffed at itthen sniffed his small friend apparently in dignified doubt as to which was terrier and which was biscuitthen lying down again he gave himself up to the pleasure of munching his meal the while tricksy with wild barks of delight performed a sort of mad wardance round and round him by way of entertainment this piece of dogcomedy was still going on when lucio turned away from his point of observation at the fence and going up to the gate rang the bell a neat maidservant answered the summons is miss clare at home he asked yes sir but i am not sure whether she will receive you the maid repliedunless you have an appointment we have no appointmentsaid luciobut if you will take these cards here he turned to megeoffrey give me one of yours i complied somewhat reluctantly if you will take these cardshe resumedto miss clare it is just possible she may be kind enough to see us if not it will be our loss he spoke so gently and with such an ingratiating manner that i could see the servant was at once prepossessed in his favour step in sir if you please she said smiling and opening the gate he obeyed with alacrityand i who a moment ago had resolved not to enter the place found myself passively following him under an archway of sprouting young leaves and early budding jessamine into lily cottagewhich was to prove one day though i knew it not then the only haven of peace and security i should ever crave forand craving be unable to win the house was much larger than it looked from the outside the entrancehall was square and lofty and panelled with fine old carved oak and the drawingroom into which we were shown was one of the most picturesque and beautiful apartments i had ever seen there were flowers everywherebooksrare bits of chinaelegant trifles that only a woman of perfect taste would have the sense to select and appreciateon one or two of the sidetables and on the grand piano were autographportraits of many of the greatest celebrities in europe lucio strolled about the room making soft comments here is the autocrat of all the russias he said pausing before a fine portrait of the tsarsigned by the imperial hand too now what has the feminine twaddler done to deserve that honour i wonder here in strange contrast is the wildhaired paderewskiand beside him the perennial pattithere is her majesty of italy and here we have the prince of walesall autographed likenesses upon my word miss clare seems to attract a great many notabilities around her without the aid of hard cash i wonder how she does it geoffreyand his eyes sparkled half maliciouslycan it be a case of genius after </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> after all look at those lilies and he pointed to a mass of white bloom in one of the windowsare they not far more beautiful creatures than men and women dumbyet eloquent of purityno wonder the painters choose them as the only flowers suitable for the adornment of angels as he spoke the door opened and the woman we had seen on the lawn entered carrying her toy terrier on one arm was she mavis clare or someone sent to say that the novelist could not receive us i wondered silently looking at her in surprise and something of confusionlucio advanced with an odd mingling of humility and appeal in his manner which was new to me we must apologise for our intrusion miss clarehe saidbut happening to pass your house we could not resist making an attempt to see you my name isrimnezhe hesitated oddly for a second then went onand this is my friend mr geoffrey tempest the author the young lady raised her eyes to mine with a little smile and courteous bend of her headhe has as i daresay you know become the owner of willowsmere court you will be neighbours and i hope friends in any case if we have committed a breach of etiquette in venturing to call upon you without previous introduction you must try and forgive us it is difficultto me impossibleto pass the dwelling of a celebrity without offering homage to the presiding genius within mavis clarefor it was mavis clareseemed not to have heard the intended compliment you are very welcome she said simply advancing with a pretty grace and extending her hand to each of us in turn i am quite accustomed to visits from strangers but i already know mr tempest very well by reputation wont you sit down she motioned us to chairs in the lilydecked windowcorner and rang the bell her maid appeared tea janet this order given she seated herself near us still holding her little dog curled up against her like a small ball of silk i tried to converse but could find nothing suitable to saythe sight of her filled me with too great a sense of selfreproach and shame she was such a quiet graceful creature so slight and dainty so perfectly unaffected and simple in manner that as i thought of the slaughtering article i had written against her work i felt like a low brute who had been stoning a child and yetafter all it was her genius i hatedthe force and passion of that mystic quality which wherever it appears compels the worlds attentionthis was the gift she had that i lacked and coveted moved by the most conflicting sensations i gazed abstractedly out on the shady old gardeni heard lucio conversing on trifling matters of society and literature generally and every now and then her bright laugh rang out like a little peal of bells soon i felt rather than saw that she was looking steadily at meand turning i met her eyesdeep dense blue eyes candidly grave and clear is this your first visit to willowsmere court she asked yes i answered making an effort to appear more at my easei bought the placeon the recommendation of my friend the prince herewithout looking at it so i heardshe said still observing me curiouslyand you are satisfied with it more than satisfiedi am delighted it exceeds all my best expectations mr tempest is going to marry the daughter of the former owner of willowsmereput in luciono doubt you have seen it announced in the papers yesshe responded with a slight smilei have seen itand i think mr tempest is much to be congratulated lady sibyl is very lovelyi remember her as a beautiful child when i was a child myselfi never spoke to her but i often saw her she must be charmed at the prospect of returning as a bride to the old home she loved so well here the servant entered with the tea and miss clare putting down her tiny dog went to the table to dispense it i watched her move across the room with a sense of vague wonder and reluctant admirationshe rather resembled a picture by greuze in her soft white gown with a pale rose nestled amid the old flemish lace at her throatand as she turned her head towards us the sunlight caught her fair hair and turned it to the similitude of a golden halo circling her brows she was not a beauty but she possessed an undoubted individual charma delicate attractiveness which silently asserted itself as the breath of honeysuckle hidden in the tangles of a hedge will delight the wayfarer with sweet fragrance though the flowers be unseen your book was very clever mr tempestshe said suddenly smiling at mei read it as soon as it came out but do you know i think your article was even cleverer i felt myself growing uncomfortably red in the face to what article do you allude miss clare i stammered confusedlyi do not write for any magazine no and she laughed gailybut you did on this occasion you slated me very smartlyi quite enjoyed it i found out that you were the author of the philippicnot through the editor of the journaloh no poor man he is very discreet but through quite another person who must be nameless it is very difficult to prevent me from finding out whatever i wish to know especially in literary matters why you look quite unhappy and her blue eyes danced with fun as she handed me my cup of teayou really dont suppose i was hurt by your critique do you dear me no nothing of that kind ever affronts mei am far too busy to waste any thought on reviews or reviewers only your article was so exceptionally funny funny i echoed stupidly trying to smile but failing in the effort yes funny she repeatedit was so very angry that it became amusing my poor differences i am really sorry it put you into such a tempertemper does exhaust ones energies so she laughed again and sat down in her former place near me regarding me with a frankly open and half humorous gaze which i found i could not meet with any sort of composure to say i felt foolish would inadequately express my sense of utter bafflement this woman with her young unclouded face sweet voice and evidently happy nature was not at all the creature i had imagined her to beand i struggled to say somethinganythingthat would furnish a reasonable and coherent answer i caught lucios glanceone of satirical amusementand my thoughts grew more entangled than ever a distraction however occurred in the behaviour of the dog tricksy who suddenly took up a position immediately opposite lucio and lifting his nose in air began to howl with a desolate loudness astonishing in so small an animal his mistress was surprised tricksy what is the matter she exclaimed catching him up in her arms where he hid his face shivering and moaningthen she looked steadily at lucioi never knew him do such a thing beforeshe saidperhaps you do not like dogs prince rimnez i am afraid they do not like me he replied deferentially then pray excuse me a moment she murmured and left the room to return immediately without her canine favorite after this i noticed that her blue eyes often rested on lucios handsome countenance with a bewildered and perplexed expression as if she saw something in his very beauty that she disliked or distrusted meanwhile i had recovered a little of my usual selfpossession and i addressed her in a tone which i meant to be kind but which i knew was somewhat patronizing i am very glad miss clare that you were not offended at the article you speak of it was rather strong i admitbut you know we cannot all be of the same opinion indeed no she said quietly and with a slight smilesuch a state of things would make a very dull world i assure you i was not and am not in the least offendedthe critique was a smart piece of writing and made not the slightest effect on me or on my book you remember what shelley wrote of critics no you will find the passage in his preface to the revolt of islam and it runs thusi have sought to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discern in my appeal to the public if certain critics were as clearsighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless as she gave the quotation her eyes darkened and deepenedher face was lighted up as by some inward illuminationand i discovered the rich sweetness of the voice which made the name of mavis suit her so well you see i know my shelley she said with a little laugh at her own emotionand those words are particularly familiar to me because i have had them painted up on a panel in my study just to remind me in case i should forget what the really great geniuses of the world thought of criticismbecause their example is very encouraging and helpful to a humble little worker like myself i am not a pressfavouriteand i never get good reviewsbut and she laughed againi like my reviewers all the same if you have finished your tea will you come and see them come and see them what did she mean she seemed delighted at my visible surprise and her cheeks dimpled with merriment come and see them she repeatedthey generally expect me at this hour she led the way into the gardenwe followedi in a bewildered confusion of mind with all my ideas respecting unsexed females and repulsive bluestockings upset by the unaffected behaviour and charming frankness of this celebrity whose fame i envied and whose personality i could not but admire with all her intellectual gifts she was yet a lovable womanah mavishow lovable and dear i was destined in misery to know mavis mavisi whisper your sweet name in my solitudei see you in my dreams and kneeling before you i call you angelmy angel at the gate of a lost paradise whose sword of genius turning every way keeps me back from all approach to my forfeited tree of life xx scarcely had we stepped out on the lawn before an unpleasant incident occurred which might have ended dangerously at his mistresss approach the big st bernard dog rose from the sunny corner where he had been peacefully dozing and prepared to greet herbut as soon as he perceived us he stopped short with an ominous growl before miss clare could utter a warning word he made a couple of huge bounds and sprang savagely at lucio as though to tear him in pieceslucio with admirable presence of mind caught him firmly by the throat and forced him backwards mavis turned deathly pale let me hold him he will obey me she cried placing her little hand on the great dogs neckdown emperor down how dare you down sir in a moment emperor dropped to the ground and crouched abjectly at her feet breathing heavily and trembling in every limb she held him by the collar and looked up at lucio who was perfectly composed though his eyes flashed dangerously i am so very sorry she murmuredi forgotyou told me dogs do not like you but what a singularly marked antipathy is it not i cannot understand it emperor is generally so goodnaturedi must apologize for his bad conductit is quite unusual i hope he has not hurt you not at all returned lucio affably but with a cold smile i hope i have not hurt himor distressed you she made no reply but led the st bernard away and was absent for a few minutes while she was gone lucios brow clouded and his face grew very stern what do you think of her he asked me abruptly i hardly know what to think i answered abstractedlyshe is very different to what i imagined her dogs are rather unpleasant company they are honest animals he said moroselythey are no doubt accustomed to candour in their mistress and therefore object to personified lies speak for yourself i said irritablythey object to you chiefly am i not fully aware of that he retortedand do i not speak for myself you do not suppose i would call you a personified lie do youeven if it were true i would not be so uncivil but i am a living lie and knowing it i admit it which gives me a certain claim to honesty above the ordinary run of men this womanwearer of laurels is a personified truthimagine itshe has no occasion to pretend to be anything else than she is no wonder she is famous i said nothing as just then the subject of our conversation returned tranquil and smiling and did her best with the tact and grace of a perfect hostess to make us forget her dogs ferocious conduct by escorting us through all the prettiest turns and twisting paths of her garden which was quite a bower of spring beauty she talked to us both with equal ease brightness and cleverness though i observed that she studied lucio with close interest and watched his looks and movements with more curiosity than liking passing under an arching grove of budding syringas we presently came to an open courtyard paved with blue and white tiles having in its centre a picturesque dovecote built in the form of a chinese pagoda here pausing mavis clapped her hands a cloud of doves white grey brown and opalescent answered the summons circling round and round her head and flying down in excited groups at her feet here are my reviewers she said laughingare they not pretty creatures the ones i know best are named after their respective journalsthere are plenty of anonymous ones of course who flock in with the rest here for instance is the saturday reviewand she picked up a strutting bird with coraltinted feet who seemed to rather like the attention shown to himhe fights with all his companions and drives them away from the food whenever he can he is a quarrelsome creaturehere she stroked the birds headyou never know how to please himhe takes offence at the corn sometimes and will only eat peas or vice versa he quite deserves his namego away old boy and she flung the pigeon in the air and watched it soaring up and downhe is such a comical old grumbler there is the speakerand she pointed to a fat fussy fantailhe struts very well and fancies hes important you know but he isnt over there is public opinionthat one halfasleep on the wall next to him is the spectatoryou see he has two rings round his eyes like spectacles that brown creature with the fluffy wings all by himself on that flowerpot is the nineteenth centurythe little bird with the green neck is the westminster gazette and the fat one sitting on the platform of the cote is the pallmall he knows his name very wellsee and she called merrilypall mall come boycome here the bird obeyed at once and flying down from the cote settled on her shoulder there are so many othersit is difficult to distinguish them sometimesshe continuedwhenever i get a bad review i name a pigeonit amuses me that draggletailed one with the muddy feet is the sketchhe is not at all a wellbred bird i must tell youthat smartlooking dove with the purple breast is the graphic and that bland old grey thing is the i l n short for illustrated london news those three white ones are respectively daily telegraph morning post and standard now see them all and taking a covered basket from a corner she began to scatter corn and peas and various grains in lavish quantities all over the court for a moment we could scarcely see the sky so thickly the birds flocked together struggling fighting swooping downwards and soaring upwardsbut the wingd confusion soon gave place to something like order when they were all on the ground and busy selecting their respective favourite foods from the different sorts provided for their choice you are indeed a sweetnatured philosophersaid lucio smiling if you can symbolize your adverse reviewers by a flock of doves she laughed merrily well it is a remedy against all irritationshe returned i used to worry a good deal over my work and wonder why it was that the press people were so unnecessarily hard upon me when they showed so much leniency and encouragement to far worse writersbut after a little serious consideration finding that critical opinion carried no sort of conviction whatever to the public i determined to trouble no more about itexcept in the way of doves in the way of doves you feed your reviewersi observed exactly and i suppose i help to feed them even as women and men she saidthey get something from their editors for slashing my workand they probably make a little more out of selling their review copies so you see the doveemblem holds good throughout but you have not seen the athenumoh you must see him with laughter still lurking in her blue eyes she took us out of the pigeoncourt and led the way round to a sequestered and shady corner of the garden where in a large aviarycage fitted up for its special convenience sat a solemn white owl the instant it perceived us it became angry and ruffling up its downy feathers rolled its glistening yellow eyes vindictively and opened its beak two smaller owls sat in the background pressed close togetherone grey the other brown cross old boy said mavis addressing the spitefullooking creature in the sweetest </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> sweetest of accentshavent you found any mice to kill today oh what wicked eyeswhat a snappy mouth then turning to us she went onisnt he a lovely owl doesnt he look wisebut as a matter of fact hes just as stupid as ever he can be that is why i call him the athenum he looks so profound youd fancy he knows everything but he really thinks of nothing but killing mice all the timewhich limits his intelligence considerably lucio laughed heartily and so did ishe looked so mischievous and merry but there are two other owls in the cagei saidwhat are their names she held up a little finger in playful warning ah that would be telling secrets she saidtheyre all the athenumthe holy threea sort of literary trinity but why a trinity i do not venture to explainit is a riddle i must leave you to guess she moved on and we followed across a velvety grassplot bordered with bright springflowers such as crocuses tulips anemones and hyacinths and presently pausing she askedwould you care to see my workroom i found myself agreeing to this proposition with an almost boyish enthusiasm lucio glanced at me with a slight halfcynical smile miss clare are you going to name a pigeon after mr tempest he inquiredhe played the part of an adverse critic you knowbut i doubt whether he will ever do so again she looked round at me and smiled oh i have been merciful to mr tempestshe replied he is among the anonymous birds whom i do not specially recognise she stepped into the arched embrasure of an open window which fronted the view of the grass and flowers and entering with her we found ourselves in a large room octagonal in shape where the first object that attracted and riveted the attention was a marble bust of the pallas athene whose grave impassive countenance and tranquil brows directly faced the sun a desk strewn with papers occupied the lefthand side of the windownookin a corner draped with olivegreen velvet the white presence of the apollo belvedere taught in his inscrutable yet radiant smile the lesson of love and the triumphs of fameand numbers of books were about not ranged in formal rows on shelves as if they were never read but placed on low tables and wheeled stands that they might be easily taken up and glanced at the arrangement of the walls chiefly excited my interest and admiration for these were divided into panels and every panel had inscribed upon it in letters of gold some phrase from the philosophers or some verse from the poets the passage from shelley which mavis had recently quoted to us occupied as she had said one panel and above it hung a beautiful basrelief of the drowned poet copied from the monument at via reggio another and broader panel held a fine engraving of shakespeare and under the picture appeared the lines to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man byron was representedalso keats but it would have taken more than a day to examine the various suggestive quaintnesses and individual charms of this workshop as its owner called it though the hour was to come when i should know every corner of it by heart and look upon it as a haunted outlaw of bygone ages looked upon sanctuary but now time gave us little pauseand when we had sufficiently expressed our pleasure and gratitude for the kindness with which we had been received lucio glancing at his watch suggested departure we could stay on here for an indefinite period miss clarehe said with an unwonted softness in his dark eyes it is a place for peace and happy meditationa restful corner for a tired soul he checked a slight sighthen went onbut trains wait for no man and we are returning to town tonight then i will not detain you any longer said our young hostess leading the way at once by a sidedoor through a passage filled with flowering plants into the drawingroom where she had first entertained usi hope mr tempest she added smiling at methat now we have met you will no longer desire to qualify as one of my pigeons it is scarcely worth while miss clare i said now speaking with unaffected sincerityi assure you on my honour i am very sorry i wrote that article against you if i had only known you as you are oh that should make no difference to a critic she answered merrily it would have made a great difference to mei declared you are so unlike the objectionable literary woman i paused and she regarded me smilingly with her bright clear candid eyesthen i addedi must tell you that sibyllady sibyl eltonis one of your most ardent admirers i am very pleased to hear thatshe said simplyi am always glad when i succeed in winning somebodys approval and liking does not everyone approve and admire you asked lucio oh no by no means the saturday says i only win the applause of shopgirls and she laughedpoor old saturdaythe writers on its staff are so jealous of any successful author i told the prince of wales what it said the other day and he was very much amused you know the prince i asked in a little surprise well it would be more correct to say that he knows me she repliedhe has been very amiable in taking some little interest in my books he knows a good deal about literature toomuch more than people give him credit for he has been here more than onceand has seen me feed my reviewersthe pigeons you know he rather enjoyed the fun i think and this was all the result of the slating the press gave to mavis clare simply that she named her doves after her critics and fed them in the presence of whatever royal or distinguished visitors she might have and i afterwards learned she had many amid no doubt much laughter from those who saw the spectatorpigeon fighting for grains of corn or the saturday review pigeon quarrelling over peas evidently no reviewer spiteful or otherwise could affect the vivacious nature of such a mischievous elf as she was how different you arehow widely differentto the ordinary run of literary people i said involuntarily i am glad you find me soshe answeredi hope i am different as a rule literary people take themselves far too seriously and attach too much importance to what they do that is why they become such bores i dont believe anyone ever did thoroughly good work who was not perfectly happy over it and totally indifferent to opinion i should be quite content to write on if i only had a garret to live in i was once very poorshockingly poor and even now i am not rich but ive got just enough to keep me working steadily which is as it should be if i had more i might get lazy and neglect my workthen you know satan might step into my life and it would be a question of idle hands and mischief to follow according to the adage i think you would have strength enough to resist satan said lucio looking at her stedfastly with sombre scrutiny in his expressive eyes oh i dont know about thati could not be sure of myself and she smiledi should imagine he must be a dangerously fascinating personage i never picture him as the possessor of hoofs and a tailcommonsense assures me that no creature presenting himself under such an aspect would have the slightest power to attract miltons conception of satan is the finestand her eyes darkened swiftly with the intensity of her thoughtsa mighty angel fallenone cannot but be sorry for such a fall if the legend were true there was a sudden silence a bird sang outside and a little breeze swayed the lilies in the window to and fro goodbye mavis clare said lucio very softly almost tenderly his voice was low and tremuloushis face grave and pale she looked up at him in a little surprise goodbye she rejoined extending her small hand he held it a momentthen to my secret astonishment knowing his aversion to women stooped and kissed it she flushed rosily as she withdrew it from his clasp be always as you are mavis clarehe said gentlylet nothing change you keep that bright nature of yoursthat unruffled spirit of quiet contentment and you may wear the bitter laurel of fame as sweetly as a rose i have seen the world i have travelled far and have met many famous men and womenkings and queens senators poets and philosophersmy experience has been wide and varied so that i am not altogether without authority for what i sayand i assure you that the satan of whom you are able to speak with compassion can never trouble the peace of a pure and contented soul like consorts with likea fallen angel seeks the equally fallenand the devilif there be onebecomes the companion of those only who take pleasure in his teaching and society legends say he is afraid of a crucifixbut if he is afraid of anything i should say it must be of that sweet content concerning which </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> which your countrys shakespeare sings and which is a better defence against evil than the church or the prayers of the clergy i speak as one having the right of age to speaki am so many many years older than youyou must forgive me if i have said too much she was quite silent evidently moved and surprised at his words and she gazed at him with a vaguely wondering halfawed expressionan expression which changed directly i myself advanced to make my adieu i am very glad to have met you miss clarei saidi hope we shall be friends there is no reason why we should be enemies i think she responded franklyi am very pleased you came today if ever you want to slate me again you know your fateyou become a dovenothing more goodbye she saluted us prettily as we passed out and when the gate had closed behind us we heard the deep and joyous baying of the great dog emperor evidently released from durance vile immediately on our departure we walked on for some time in silence and it was not till we had reentered the grounds of willowsmere and were making our way to the drive where the carriage which was to take us to the station already awaited us that lucio said well now what do you think of her she is as unlike the accepted ideal of the female novelist as she can well be i answered with a laugh accepted ideals are generally mistaken oneshe observed watching me narrowlyan accepted ideal of divinity in some church pictures is an old mans face set in a triangle the accepted ideal of the devil is a nondescript creature with horns hoofs one of them cloven and a tail as miss clare just now remarked the accepted ideal of beauty is the venus de mediciswhereas your lady sibyl entirely transcends that much overrated statue the accepted ideal of a poet is apollohe was a godand no poet in the flesh ever approaches the godlike and the accepted ideal of the female novelist is an elderly dowdy spectacled frowsy frightmavis clare does not fulfil this description yet she is the author of differences now mcwhing who thrashes her continually in all the papers he can command is elderly ugly spectacled and frowsyand he is the author ofnothing womenauthors are invariably supposed to be hideousmenauthors for the most part are hideous but their hideousness is not noted or insisted uponwhereas no matter how goodlooking womenwriters may be they still pass under presscomment as frights because the fiat of pressopinion considers they ought to be frights even if they are not a pretty authoress is an offencean incongruitya something that neither men nor women care about men dont care about her because being clever and independent she does not often care about themwomen dont care about her because she has the effrontery to combine attractive looks with intelligence and she makes an awkward rival to those who have only attractive looks without intelligence so wags the world o wild worldcircling through ons untold mid fires of sunrise and sunsetthrough flashes of silver and gold grain of dust in a stormatom of sand by the sea what is your worth o world to the angels of god and me he sang this quite suddenly his rich baritone pealing out musically on the warm silent air i listened entranced what a voice you have i exclaimedwhat a glorious gift he smiled and sang on his dark eyes flashing o wild world mote in a burning ray flung from the spherical heavens millions of spaces away sink in the ether or soar live with the planets or die what should i care for your fate who am one with the infinite sky what strange song is that i asked startled and thrilled by the passion of his voiceit seems to mean nothing he laughed and took my arm it does mean nothing he saidall drawingroom songs mean nothing mine is a drawingroom songcalculated to waken emotional impulses in the unloved spinster religiously inclined nonsense i said smiling exactly that is what i say it is nonsense here we came up to the carriage which waited for usjust twenty minutes to catch the train geoffrey off we go and off we did goi watching the red gabled roofs of willowsmere court shining in the late sunshine till a turn in the road hid them from view you like your purchase queried lucio presently i do immensely and your rival mavis clare do you like her i paused a moment then answered frankly yes i like her and i will admit something more than that to you now i like her book it is a noble workworthy of the most highlygifted man i always liked itand because i liked it i slated it rather a mysterious course of procedure and he smiled can you not explain of course i can explaini saidexplanation is easy i envied her poweri envy it still her popularity caused me a smarting sense of injury and to relieve it i wrote that article against her but i shall never do anything of the kind again i shall let her grow her laurels in peace laurels have a habit of growing without any permissionobserved lucio significantlyin all sorts of unexpected places too and they can never be properly cultivated in the forcinghouse of criticism i know that i said quickly my thoughts reverting to my own book and all the favourable criticisms that had been heaped upon iti have learned that lesson thoroughly by heart he looked at me fixedly it is only one of many you may have yet to learnhe saidit is a lesson in fame your next course of instruction will be in love he smiledbut i was conscious of a certain dread and discomfort as he spoke i thought of sibyl and her incomparable beautysibyl who had told me she could not lovehad we both to learn a lesson and should we master itor would it master us xxi the preparations for my marriage now went on apaceshoals of presents began to arrive for sibyl as well as for myself and i was introduced to an hitherto undemonstrated phase as far as i personally was concerned of the vulgarity and hypocrisy of fashionable society everyone knew the extent of my wealth and how little real necessity there was for offering me or my brideelect costly gifts nevertheless all our socalled friends and acquaintances strove to outvie each other in the gross cashvalue if not in the good taste of their various donations had we been a young couple bravely beginning the world on true love in more or less uncertainty as to our prospects and future income we should have received nothing either useful or valuableeveryone would have tried to do the presentgiving in as cheap and mean a way as possible instead of handsome services of solid silver we should have had a meagre collection of plated teaspoons instead of costly editions of books sumptuously enriched with fine steel engravings we might possibly have had to express our gratitude for a tenshilling family bible of course i fully realized the actual nature and object of the lavish extravagance displayed on this occasion by our social settheir gifts were merely so many bribes sent with a purpose which was easy enough to fathom the donors wished to be invited to the wedding in the first placeafter that they sought to be included in our visitinglist and foresaw invitations to our dinners and housepartiesand more than this they calculated on our influence in society and the possible chance there might be in the dim future of our lending some of them money should pressing occasion require it in the scant thankfulness and suppressed contempt their adulatory offerings excited sibyl and i were completely at one she looked upon her array of glittering valuables with the utmost weariness and indifference and flattered my selflove by assuring me that the only things she cared at all for were the rivire of sapphires and diamonds i had given her as a betrothalpledge together with an engagementring of the same lustrous gems yet i noticed she also had a great liking for lucios present which was a truly magnificent masterpiece of the jewellers art it was a girdle in the form of a serpent the body entirely composed of the finest emeralds and the head of rubies and diamonds flexible as a reed when sibyl put it on it appeared to spring and coil round her waist like a living thing and breathe with her breathing i did not much care for it myself as an ornament for a young brideit seemed to me quite unsuitablebut as everyone else admired it and envied the possessor of such superb jewels i said nothing of my own distaste diana chesney had shown a certain amount of delicate sentiment and refinement in her offeringit was a very exquisite marble statue of psyche mounted on a pedestal of solid silver and ebony sibyl thanked her smiling coldly you have given me an emblem of the soulshe said no doubt you remembered i have no soul of my own and her airy laugh had chilled poor diana to the marrow as the warmhearted little american herself with tears assured me at this period i saw very </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense3> very little of rimnez i was much occupied with my lawyers on the question of settlements messrs bentham and ellis rather objected to the arrangement by which i gave the half of my fortune to my intended wife unconditionally but i would brook no interference and the deed was drawn up signed sealed and witnessed the earl of elton could not sufficiently praise my unexampled generositymy noble characterand walked about eulogising me everywhere till he almost turned himself into a public advertisement of the virtues of his future soninlaw he seemed to have taken a new lease of lifehe flirted with diana chesney openlyand of his paralysed spouse with the fixed stare and deathly grin he never spoke and i imagine never thought sibyl herself was always in the hands of dressmakers and millinersand we only saw each other every day for a few minutes hurried chat on these occasions she was always charmingeven affectionate and yetthough i was full of passionate admiration and love for her i felt that she was mine merely as a slave might be mine that she gave me her lips to kiss as if she considered i had a right to kiss them because i had bought them and for no other reasonthat her pretty caresses were studied and her whole behaviour the result of careful forethought and not natural impulsiveness i tried to shake off this impression but it still remained persistently and clouded the sweetness of my brief courtship meanwhile slowly and almost imperceptibly my boomed book dropped out of notice morgeson presented a heavy bill of publishing costs which i paid without a murmur now and then an allusion to my literary triumphs cropped up in one or other of the newspapers but otherwise no one spoke of my famous work and few read it i enjoyed the same sort of cliquey reputation and public failure attending a certain novel entitled marius the epicurean the journalists with whom i had come in contact began to drift away like flotsam and jetsam i think they saw i was not likely to give many more reviewing dinners or suppers and that my marriage with the earl of eltons daughter would lift me into an atmosphere where grubstreet could not breathe comfortably or stretch its legs at ease the heap of gold on which i sat as on a throne divided me gradually from even the back courts and lower passages leading to the temple of fameand almost unconsciously to myself i retreated step by step shading my eyes as it were from the sun and seeing the glittering turrets in the distance with a womans slight figure entering the lofty portico turning back her laurelled head to smile sorrowfully and with divinest pity upon me ere passing in to salute the gods yet if asked about it everyone on the press would have said that i had had a great success ionly irealized the bitterness and truth of my failure i had not touched the heart of the publici had not succeeded in so waking my readers out of the torpor of their dull and commonplace everyday lives that they should turn towards me with outstretched hands exclaimingmoremore of these thoughts which comfort and inspire uswhich make us hear gods voice proclaiming alls well above the storms of life i had not done iti could not do it and the worst part of my feeling on this point was the idea that possibly i might have done it had i remained poor the strongest and healthiest pulse in the composition of a manthe necessity for hard workhad been killed in me i knew i need not work that the society in which i now moved thought it ridiculous if i did work that i was expected to spend money and enjoy myself in the idiotic fashion of what the upper ten term enjoyment my acquaintances were not slow in suggesting plans for the dissipation of my surplus cashwhy did i not build for myself a marble palace on the rivieraor a yacht to completely outshine the prince of waless britannia why did i not start a theatre or found a newspaper not one of my social advisers once proposed my doing any private personal good with my fortune when some terrible case of distress was published and subscriptions were raised to relieve the object or objects of suffering i invariably gave ten guineas and allowed myself to be thanked for my generous assistance i might as well have given ten pence for the guineas were no more to me in comparison than the pence when funds were started to erect a statue to some great man who had in the usual way of the world been a victim of misrepresentation till his death i produced my ten guineas again when i could easily have defrayed the whole cost of the memorial with honour to myself and been none the poorer with all my wealth i did nothing noteworthy i showered no unexpected luck in the way of the patient struggling workers in the hard schools of literature and art i gave no largesse among the poorand when a thin eagereyed curate with a strong earnest face called upon me one day to represent with much nervous diffidence the hideous sufferings of some of the sick and starving in his district down by the docks and suggested that i might possibly care to alleviate a few of these direful sorrows as a satisfaction to myself as well as for the sake of human brotherhood i am ashamed to say i let him go with a sovereign for which he heaped coals of fire on my head by his simple god bless you and thank you i could see he was himself in the grip of povertyi could have made him and his poor district gloriously happy by a few strokes of my pen on a cheque for an amount i should never have missedand yeti gave him nothing but that one piece of gold and so allowed him to depart he invited me with earnest goodwill to go and see his starving flockfor believe me mr tempest said hei should be sorry if you thought as some of the wealthy are unhappily apt to do that i seek money simply to apply it to my own personal uses if you would visit the district yourself and distribute whatever you pleased with your own hand it would be infinitely more gratifying to me and would have a far better effect on the minds of the people for sir the poor will not always be patient under the cruel burdens they have to bear i smiled indulgently and assured him not without a touch of satire in my tone that i was convinced all clergymen were honest and unselfishand then i sent my servant to bow him out with all possible politeness and that very day i remember i drank at my luncheon chateau yquem at twentyfive shillings a bottle i enter into these apparently trifling details because they all help to make up the sum and substance of the deadly consequences to followand also because i wish to emphasize the fact that in my actions i only imitated the example of my compeers most rich men today follow the same course as i didand active personal good to the community is wrought by very few of them no great deed of generosity illumines our annals royalty itself leads no fashion in thisthe royal gifts of game and castoff clothing sent to our hospitals are too slight and conventional to carry weight the entertainments for the poor got up by some of the aristocrats at the east end are nothing and less than nothing they are weak sops to our tame lion couchant offered in doubtful fear and trembling for our lion is wakeful and somewhat restivethere is no knowing what may happen if the original ferocity of the beast is roused a few of our overrich men might considerably ease the load of cruel poverty in many quarters of the metropolis if they united themselves with a noble unselfishness in the strong and determined effort to do so and eschewed redtapeism and wordy argument but they remain inertspending solely on their own personal gratification and amusementand meanwhile there are dark signs of trouble brooding the poor as the lean and anxious curate said will not always be patient i must not here forget to mention that through some secret management of rimnez my name much to my own surprise appeared on the list of competitors for the derby how at so late an hour this had been effected i knew no more than where my horse phosphor came from it was a superb animal but rimnez whose gift to me it was warned me to be careful as to the character of the persons admitted into the stables to view it and to allow no one but the horses own two attendants to linger near it long on any pretext speculation was very rife as to what phosphors capabilities really were the grooms never showed him off to advantage during exercise i was amazed when lucio told me his man amiel would be the jockey good heavensnot possible i exclaimed can he ride like the very devilresponded my friend with a smile he will ride phosphor </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> phosphor to the winningpost i was very doubtful in my own mind of this a horse of the prime ministers was to run and all the betting was on that side few had seen phosphor and those few though keen admirers of the animals appearance had little opportunity of judging its actual qualities thanks to the careful management of its two attendants who were darkfaced reticentlooking men somewhat after amiels character and complexion i myself was quite indifferent as to the result of the contest i did not really care whether phosphor lost or won the race i could afford to lose and it would be little to me if i won save a momentary passing triumph there was nothing lasting intellectual or honourable in the victorythere is nothing lasting intellectual or honourable in anything connected with racing however because it was fashionable to be interested in this particular mode of wasting time and money i followed the general lead for the sake of being talked about and nothing more meanwhile lucio saying little to me concerning it was busy planning the betrothalfte at willowsmere and designing all sorts of surprise entertainments for the guests eight hundred invitations were sent out and society soon began to chatter volubly and excitedly on the probable magnificence of the forthcoming festival eager acceptances poured in only a few of those asked were hindered from attending by illness family deaths or previous engagements and among these latter to my regret was mavis clare she was going to the seacoast to stay with some old friends and in a prettilyworded letter explained this and expressed her thanks for my invitation though she found herself unable to accept it how curious it was that when i read her little note of refusal i should experience such a keen sense of disappointment she was nothing to menothing but a literary woman who by strange chance happened to be sweeter than most women unliterary and yet i felt that the fte at willowsmere would lose something in brightness lacking her presence i had wanted to introduce her to sibyl as i knew i should thus give a special pleasure to my betrothedhowever it was not to be and i was conscious of an inexplicable personal vexation in strict accordance with the promise made i let rimnez have his own way entirely with regard to all the arrangements for what was to be the ne plus ultra of everything ever designed for the distraction amusement and wonderment of listless and fastidious swagger people and i neither interfered nor asked any questions content to rely on my friends taste imagination and ingenuity i only understood that all the plans were being carried out by foreign artists and caterersand that no english firms would be employed i did venture once to inquire the reason of this and got one of lucios own enigmatical replies nothing english is good enough for the englishhe saidthings have to be imported from france to please the people whom the french themselves angrily designate as perfide albion you must not have a bill of fare you must have a menu and all your dishes must bear french titles otherwise they will not be in good form you must have french comediennes and danseuses to please the british taste and your silken draperies must be woven on french looms lately too it has been deemed necessary to import parisian morality as well as parisian fashions it does not suit stalwart great britain at all you knowstalwart great britain aping the manners of paris looks like a jolly openfaced sturdylimbed giant with a dolls bonnet stuck on his leonine head but the dolls bonnet is just now la mode some day i believe the giant will discover it looks ridiculous and cast it off with a burst of genuine laughter at his own temporary folly and without it he will resume his original dignitythe dignity that best becomes a privileged conqueror who has the sea for his standingarmy evidently you like england i said smiling he laughed not in the very least i do not like england any more than any other country on the globe i do not like the globe itself and england comes in for a share of my aversion as one of the spots on the trumpery ball if i could have my way i should like to throne myself on a convenient star for the purpose and kick out at earth as she whirls by in space hoping by that act of just violence to do away with her for ever but why i asked amusedwhy do you hate the earth what has the poor little planet done to merit your abhorrence he looked at me very strangely shall i tell you you will never believe me no matter for that i answered smilingsay on what has the poor little planet done he repeated slowlythe poor little planet has donenothing but it is what the gods have done with this same poor little planet that awakens my anger and scorn they have made it a living sphere of wondersendowed it with beauty borrowed from the fairest corners of highest heavendecked it with flowers and foliagetaught it musicthe music of birds and torrents and rolling waves and falling rainsrocked it gently in clear ether among such light as blinds the eyes of mortalsguided it out of chaos through clouds of thunder and barbd shafts of lightning to circle peacefully in its appointed orbit lit on the one hand by the vivid splendours of the sun and on the other by the sleepy radiance of the moonand more than all this they have invested it with a divine soul in man oh you may disbelieve as you willbut notwithstanding the pigmy peeps earth takes at the vast and eternal ocean of science the soul is here and all the immortal forces with it and around it nay the godsi speak in the plural after the fashion of the ancient greeksfor to my thinking there are many gods emanating from the supreme deitythe gods i say have so insisted on this fact that one of them has walked the earth in human guise solely for the sake of emphasizing the truth of immortality to these frail creatures of seemingly perishable clay for this i hate the planetwere there not and are there not other and far grander worlds that a god should have chosen to dwell on than this one for a moment i was silent out of sheer surprise you amaze me i said at lastyou allude to christ i suppose but everybody is convinced by this time that he was a mere man like the rest of us there was nothing divine about him what a contradiction you are why i remember you indignantly denied the accusation of being a christian of courseand i deny it stillhe answered quicklyi have not a fat living in the church that i should tell a lie on such a subject i am not a christian nor is anyone living a christian to quote a very old saying there never was a christian save one and he was crucified but though i am not a christian i never said i doubted the existence of christ that knowledge was forced upon mewith considerable pressure too by a reliable authority i inquired with a slight sneer he made no immediate reply his flashing eyes looked as it were through me and beyond me at something far away the curious pallor that at times gave his face the set look of an impenetrable mask came upon him then and he smiledan awful smile so might a man smile out of deadly bravado when told of some dim and dreadful torture awaiting him you touch me on a sore pointhe said at last slowly and in a harsh tonemy convictions respecting certain religious phases of mans development and progress are founded on the arduous study of some very unpleasant truths to which humanity generally shuts its eyes burying its head in the desertsands of its own delusions these truths i will not enter upon now some other time i will initiate you into a few of my mysteries the tortured smile passed from his face leaving it intellectually composed and calm as usualand i hastily changed the subject for i had made up my mind by this time that my brilliant friend had like many exceptionally gifted persons a craze on one topic and that topic a particularly difficult one to discuss as it touched on the superhuman and therefore to my thinking the impossible my own temperament which had in the days of my poverty fluctuated between spiritual striving and material gain had with my sudden access to fortune rapidly hardened into the character of a man of the world worldly for whom all speculations as to the unseen forces working in and around us were the merest folly not worth a moments waste of thought i should have laughed to scorn anyone who had then presumed to talk to me about the law of eternal justice which with individuals as well as nations works not for a passing phase but for all time towards good and not evilfor no matter how much a man may strive to blind himself to the fact he has a portion of the divine within him </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> him which if he wilfully corrupts by his own wickedness he must be forced to cleanse again and yet again in the fierce flames of such remorse and such despair as are rightly termed the quenchless fires of hell xxii on the afternoon of the twentyfirst of may i went down accompanied by lucio to willowsmere to be in readiness for the reception of the social swarm who were to flock thither the next day amiel went with usbut i left my own man morris behind to take charge of my rooms in the grand and to forward late telegrams and special messages the weather was calm warm and brightand a young moon showed her thin crescent in the sky as we got out at the country station and stepped into the open carriage awaiting us the stationofficials greeted us with servile humility eyeing lucio especially with an almost gaping air of wonderment the fact of his lavish expenditure in arranging with the railway company a service of special trains for the use of the morrows guests had no doubt excited them to a speechless extent of admiration as well as astonishment when we approached willowsmere and entered the beautiful drive bordered with oak and beech which led up to the house i uttered an exclamation of delight at the festal decorations displayed for the whole avenue was spanned with arches of flags and flowers garlands of blossoms being even swung from tree to tree and interlacing many of the lower branches the gabled porch at the entrance of the house was draped with crimson silk and festooned with white rosesand as we alighted the door was flung open by a smart page in brilliant scarlet and gold i think said lucio to me as we enteredyou will find everything as complete as this worlds resources will allow the retinue of servants here are what is vulgarly called on the job their payment is agreed upon and they know their duties thoroughlythey will give you no trouble i could scarcely find words to express my unbounded satisfaction or to thank him for the admirable taste with which the beautiful house had been adorned i wandered about in an ecstasy of admiration triumphing in such a visible and gorgeous display of what great wealth could really do the ballroom had been transformed into an elegant bijou theatre the stage being concealed by a curtain of thick goldcoloured silk on which the oftquoted lines of shakespeare were embroidered in raised letters all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players turning out of this into the drawingroom i found it decorated entirely round with banks of roses red and white the flowers forming a huge pyramid at one end of the apartment behind which as lucio informed me unseen musicians would discourse sweet harmony i have arranged for a few tableaux vivants in the theatre to fill up a gap of timehe said carelesslyfashionable folks nowadays get so soon tired of one amusement that it is necessary to provide several in order to distract the brains that cannot think or discover any means of entertainment in themselves as a matter of fact people cannot even converse long together because they have nothing to say oh dont bother to go out in the grounds on a tour of inspection just nowleave a few surprises for yourself as well as for your company tomorrow come and have dinner he put his arm through mine and we entered the diningroom here the table was laid out with costly fruit flowers and delicacies of every descriptionfour menservants in scarlet and gold stood silently in waiting with amiel in black as usual behind his masters chair we enjoyed a sumptuous repast served to perfection and when it was finished we strolled out in the grounds to smoke and talk you seem to do everything by magic lucioi said looking at him wonderinglyall these lavish decorationsthese servants money my dear fellownothing but moneyhe interrupted with a laughmoney the devils passkey you can have the retinue of a king without any of a kings responsibilities if you only choose to pay for it it is merely a question of cost and taste i reminded him trueand taste some rich men there are who have less taste than a costermonger i know one who has the egregious vulgarity to call the attention of his guests to the value of his goods and chattels he pointed out for my admiration one day an antique and hideous china plate the only one of that kind in the world and told me it was worth a thousand guineas break iti said coollyyou will then have the satisfaction of knowing you have destroyed a thousand guineas worth of undesirable ugliness you should have seen his face he showed me no more curios i laughed and we walked slowly up and down for a few minutes in silence presently i became aware that my companion was looking at me intently and i turned my head quickly to meet his eyes he smiled i was just then thinking he said what you would have done with your life if you had not inherited this fortune and ifif i had not come your way i should have starved no doubti respondeddied like a rat in a holeof want and wretchedness i rather doubt that he said meditativelyit is just possible you might have become a great writer why do you say that now i asked because i have been reading your book there are fine ideas in itideas that might had they been the result of sincere conviction have reached the public in time because they were sane and healthy the public will never put up for long with corrupt fads and artificial crazes now you write of godyet according to your own statement you did not believe in god even when you wrote the words that imply his existenceand that was long before i met you therefore the book was not the result of sincere conviction and thats the keynote of your failure to reach the large audience you desired each reader can see you do not believe what you writethe trumpet of lasting fame never sounds triumph for an author of that calibre dont let us talk about it for heavens sake i said irritablyi know my work lacks somethingand that something may be what you say or it may noti do not want to think about it let it perish as it assuredly will perhaps in the future i may do better he was silentand finishing his cigar threw the end away in the grass where it burned like a dull red coal i must turn in he then observedi have a few more directions to give to the servants for tomorrow i shall go to my room as soon as i have doneso ill say goodnight but surely you are taking too much personal troublei saidcant i help in any way no you canthe answered smiling when i undertake to do anything i like to do it in my own fashion or not at all sleep well and rise early he nodded and sauntered slowly away over the dewy grass i watched his dark tall figure receding till he had entered the house then lighting a fresh cigar i wandered on alone through the grounds noting here and there flowery arbours and dainty silk pavilions erected in picturesque nooks and corners for the morrow i looked up at the sky it was clear and brightthere would be no rain presently i opened the wicketgate that led into the outer byroad and walking on slowly almost unconsciously i found myself in a few minutes opposite lily cottage approaching the gate i looked inthe pretty old house was dark silent and deserted i knew mavis clare was awayand it was not strange that the aspect of her homenest emphasized the fact of her absence a cluster of climbing roses hanging from the wall looked as if they were listening for the first sound of her returning footsteps across the green breadth of the lawn where i had seen her playing with her dogs a tall sheaf of st johns lilies stood up white against the sky their pure hearts opened to the starlight and the breeze the scent of honeysuckle and sweetbriar filled the air with delicate suggestionsand as i leaned over the low fence gazing vaguely at the long shadows of the trees on the grass a nightingale began to sing the sweet yet dolorous warble of the little brown lover of the moon palpitated on the silence in silvertoned drops of melody and i listened till my eyes smarted with a sudden moisture as of tears strangely enough i never thought of my betrothed bride sibyl then as surely by all the precedents of passion i should have done at such a moment of dreamful ecstasy it was another womans face that floated before my memorya face not beautifulbut merely sweetand made radiant by the light of two tender wistful wonderfully innocent eyesa face like that of some new daphne with the mystic laurel springing from her brows the nightingale sang on and onthe tall lilies swayed in the faint wind as though nodding wise approval of the birds wild musicand gathering one briarrose from the hedge i turned away </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense4> away with a curious heaviness at my hearta trouble i could not analyse or account for i explained my feeling partly to myself as one of regret that i had ever taken up my pen to assault with sneer and flippant jest the gentle and brilliantly endowed owner of this little home where peace and pure content dwelt happily in studentlike seclusionbut this was not all there was something else in my mindsomething inexplicable and sadwhich then i had no skill to define i know now what it wasbut the knowledge comes too late returning to my own domains i saw through the trees a vivid red light in one of the upper windows of willowsmere it twinkled like a lurid star and i guided my steps by its brilliancy as i made my way across the winding gardenpaths and terraces back to the house entering the hall the page in scarlet and gold met me and with a respectful obeisance escorted me to my room where amiel was in waiting has the prince retired i asked him yes sir he has a red lamp in his window has he not amiel looked deferentially meditative yet i fancied i saw him smile i thinkyesi believe he has sir i asked no more questions but allowed him to perform his duties as valet in silence goodnight sir he said at last his ferret eyes fastened upon me with an expressionless look goodnight i responded indifferently he left the room with his usual catlike stealthy tread and when he had gone imoved by a sudden fresh impulse of hatred for himsprang to the door and locked it then i listened with an odd nervous breathlessness there was not a sound for fully quarter of an hour i remained with my attention more or less strained expectant of i knew not what but the quiet of the house was absolutely undisturbed with a sigh of relief i flung myself on the luxurious beda couch fit for a king draped with the richest satin elaborately embroideredand falling soundly asleep i dreamed that i was poor again poorbut unspeakably happyand hard at work in the old lodging writing down thoughts which i knew by some divine intuition and beyond all doubt would bring me the whole worlds honour again i heard the sounds of the violin played by my unseen neighbour next door and this time they were triumphal chords and cadences of joy without one throb of sorrow and while i wrote on in an ecstasy of inspiration oblivious of poverty and pain i heard echoing through my visions the round warble of the nightingale and saw in the far distance an angel floating towards me on pinions of light with the face of mavis clare xxiii the morning broke clear with all the pure tints of a fine opal radiating in the cloudless sky never had i beheld such a fair scene as the woods and gardens of willowsmere when i looked upon them that day illumined by the unclouded sunlight of a spring halfmelting into summer my heart swelled with pride as i surveyed the beautiful domain i now ownedand thought how happy a home it would make when sibyl matchless in her loveliness shared with me its charm and luxury yesi said halfaloudsay what philosophers will the possession of money does insure satisfaction and power it is all very well to talk about fame but what is fame worth if like carlyle one is too poor to enjoy it besides literature no longer holds its former high prestigethere are too many in the fieldtoo many newspaperscribblers all believing they are geniusestoo many illeducated ladyparagraphists and new women who think they are as gifted as georges sand or mavis clare with sibyl and willowsmere i ought to be able to resign the idea of fameliterary famewith a good grace i knew i reasoned falsely with myselfi knew that my hankering for a place among the truly great of the world was as strong as everi knew i craved for the intellectual distinction force and pride which make the thinker a terror and a power in the land and which so sever a great poet or great romancist from the commoner throng that even kings are glad to do him or her honourbut i would not allow my thoughts to dwell on this rapidly vanishing point of unattainable desire i settled my mind to enjoy the luscious flavour of the immediate present as a bee settles in the cup of honeyflowersand leaving my bedroom i went downstairs to breakfast with lucio in the best and gayest of humours not a cloud on the day he said meeting me with a smile as i entered the bright morningroom whose windows opened on the lawnthe fte will be a brilliant success geoffrey thanks to you i answeredpersonally i am quite in the dark as to your plansbut i believe you can do nothing that is not well done you honour me he said with a light laughyou credit me then with better qualities than the creator for what he does in the opinion of the present generation is exceedingly ill done men have taken to grumbling at him instead of praising himand few have any patience with or liking for his laws i laughed well you must admit those laws are very arbitrary they are i entirely acknowledge the fact we sat down to table and were waited upon by admirablytrained servants who apparently had no idea of anything else but attendance on our needs there was no trace of bustle or excitement in the householdno sign whatever to denote that a great entertainment was about to take place that day it was not until the close of our meal that i asked lucio what time the musicians would arrive he glanced at his watch about noon i should sayhe repliedperhaps before but whatever their hour they will all be in their places at the proper moment depend upon it the people i employboth musicians and artistesknow their business thoroughly and are aware that i stand no nonsense a rather sinister smile played round his mouth as he regarded me none of your guests can arrive here till one oclockas that is about the time the special train will bring the first batch of them from londonand the first djeuner will be served in the gardens at two if you want to amuse yourself theres a maypole being put up on the large lawnyoud better go and look at it a maypole i exclaimednow thats a good idea it used to be a good ideahe answeredwhen english lads and lasses had youth innocence health and fun in their composition a dance round the maypole hand in hand did them good and did nobody harm but now there are no lads and lassesenervated old men and women in their teens walk the world wearily speculating on the uses of lifeprobing vice and sneering down sentiment and such innocent diversions as the maypole no longer appeal to our jaded youth so we have to get professionals to execute the mayrevelsof course the dancing is better done by properly trained legs but it means nothing and is nothing except a pretty spectacle and are the dancers here i asked rising and going towards the window in some curiosity no not yet but the maypole isfully decorated it faces the woods at the back of the housego and see if you like it i followed his suggestion and going in the direction indicated i soon perceived the gailydecked object which used to be the welcome signal of many a village holiday in shakespeares oldworld england the pole was already set up and fixed in a deep socket in the ground and a dozen or more men were at work unbinding its numerous trails of blossom and garlands of green tied with long streamers of varicoloured ribbon it had a picturesque effect in the centre of the wide lawn bordered with grand old treesand approaching one of the men i said something to him by way of approval and admiration he glanced at me furtively and unsmilingly but said nothingand i concluded from his dark and foreign cast of features that he did not understand the english language i noted with some wonder and slight vexation that all the workmen were of this same alien and sinister type of countenance very much after the unattractive models of amiel and the two grooms who had my racer phosphor in charge but i remembered what lucio had told menamely that all the designs for the fte were carried out by foreign experts and artistsand after some puzzled consideration i let the matter pass from my mind the morning hours flew swiftly by and i had little time to examine all the festal preparations with which the gardens aboundedso that i was almost as ignorant of what was in store for the amusement of my guests as the guests themselves i had the curiosity to wait about and watch for the coming of the musicians and dancers but i might as well have spared myself this waste of time and trouble for i never saw them arrive at all at one oclock both lucio and i were ready to receive our companyand at about twenty minutes past the hour the first instalment of swagger </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> swagger society was emptied into the grounds sibyl and her father were among theseand i eagerly advanced to meet and greet my brideelect as she alighted from the carriage that had brought her from the station she looked supremely beautiful that day and was as she deserved to be the cynosure of all eyes i kissed her little gloved hand with a deeper reverence than i would have kissed the hand of a queen welcome back to your old home my sibyl i said to her in a low voice tenderly at which words she paused looking up at the red gables of the house with such wistful affection as filled her eyes with something like tears she left her hand in mine and allowed me to lead her towards the silkendraped flowerdecked porch where lucio waited smilingand as she advanced two tiny pages in pure white and silver glided suddenly out of some unseen hidingplace and emptied two baskets of pink and white roseleaves at her feet thus strewing a fragrant pathway for her into the house they vanished as completely and swiftly as they had appearedsome of the guests uttered murmurs of admiration while sibyl gazed about her blushing with surprise and pleasure how charming of you geoffrey she said what a poet you are to devise so pretty a greeting i wish i deserved your praise i answered smiling at herbut the poet in question is prince rimnezhe is the master and ruler of todays revels again the rich colour flushed her cheeks and she gave lucio her hand he bowed over it in courtly fashionbut did not kiss it as he had kissed the hand of mavis clare we passed into the house through the drawingroom and out again into the gardens lord elton being loud in his praise of the artistic manner in which his former dwelling had been improved and embellished soon the lawn was sprinkled with gaily attired groups of peopleand my duties as host began in hard earnest i had to be greeted complimented flattered and congratulated on my approaching marriage by scores of hypocrites who nearly shook my hand off in their enthusiasm for my wealth had i become suddenly poor i thought grimly not one of them would have lent me a sovereign the guests kept on arriving in shoals and when there were about three or four hundred assembled a burst of exquisite music sounded and a procession of pages in scarlet and gold marching two by two appeared carrying trays full of the rarest flowers tied up in bouquets which they offered to all the ladies present exclamations of delight arose on every sideexclamations which were for the most part highpitched and noisyfor the swagger set have long ceased to cultivate softness of voice or refinement of accentand once or twice the detestable slang word ripping escaped from the lips of a few dashing dames reputed to be leaders of style repose of manner dignity and elegance of deportment however are no longer to be discovered among the present racing duchesses and gambling countesses of the bluest blue blood of england so one does not expect these graces of distinction from them the louder they can talk and the more slang they can adopt from the language of their grooms and stableboys the more are they judged to be in the swim and up to date i speak of course of the modern scions of aristocracy there are a few truly great ladies left whose maxim is still noblesse obligebut they are quite in the minority and by the younger generation are voted either old cats or bores many of the cultured mob that now swarmed over my grounds had come out of the sheerest vulgar curiosity to see what the man with five millions could do in the way of entertainingothers were anxious to get news if possible of the chances of phosphor winning the derby concerning which i was discreetly silent but the bulk of the crowd wandered aimlessly about staring impertinently or enviously at each other and scarcely looking at the natural loveliness of the gardens or the woodland scenery around them the brainlessness of modern society is never so flagrantly manifested as at a gardenparty where the restless trousered and petticoated bipeds move vaguely to and fro scarcely stopping to talk civilly or intelligently to one another for five minutes most of them hovering dubiously and awkwardly between the refreshmentpavilion and the bandstand in my domain they were deprived of this latter harbour of refuge for no musicians could be seen though music was heardbeautiful wild music which came first from one part of the grounds and then from another and to which few listened with any attention all were however happily unanimous in their enthusiastic appreciation of the excellence of the food provided for them in the luxurious luncheon tents of which there were twenty in number men ate as if they had never eaten in their lives before and drank the choice and exquisite wines with equal greed and gusto one never entirely realises the extent to which human gourmandism can go till one knows a few peers bishops and cabinetministers and watches those dignitaries feed ad libitum soon the company was so complete that there was no longer any need for me to perform the fatiguing duty of receiving and i therefore took sibyl in to luncheon determining to devote myself to her for the rest of the day she was in one of her brightest and most captivating moodsher laughter rang out as sweetly joyous as that of some happy childshe was even kind to diana chesney who was also one of my guests and who was plainly enjoying herself with all the verve peculiar to pretty american women who consider flirtation as much of a game as tennis the scene was now one of great brilliancy the light costumes of the women contrasting well with the scarlet and gold liveries of the seemingly innumerable servants that were now everywhere in active attendance and constantly through the fluttering festive crowd from tent to tent from table to table and group to group lucio movedhis tall stately figure and handsome face always conspicuous wherever he stood his rich voice thrilling the air whenever he spoke his influence was irresistible and gradually dominated the whole assemblagehe roused the dull inspired the witty encouraged the timid and brought all the conflicting elements of rival position character and opinion into one uniform whole which was unconsciously led by his will as easily as a multitude is led by a convincing orator i did not know it then but i know now that metaphorically speaking he had his foot on the neck of that society mob as though it were one prostrate manthat the sycophants liars and hypocrites whose utmost idea of good is wealth and luxurious living bent to his secret power as reeds bend to the windand that he did with them all whatsoever he choseas he does to this very day godif the grinning guzzling sensual fools had only known what horrors were about them at the feastwhat ghastly ministers to pleasurable appetite waited obediently upon themwhat pallid terrors lurked behind the gorgeous show of vanity and pride but the veil was mercifully downand only to me has it since been lifted luncheon over the singing of mirthful voices tuned to a kind of village roundelay attracted the company now fed to repletion towards the lawn at the back of the house and cries of delight were raised as the maypole came into view i myself joining in the universal applause for i had not expected to see anything half so picturesque and pretty the pole was surrounded by a double ring of small childrenchildren so beautiful in face and dainty in form that they might very well have been taken for little fairies from some enchanted woodland the boys were clad as tiny foresters in doublets of green with pink caps on their curly locksthe girls were in white with their hair flowing loosely over their shoulders and wreaths of mayblossom crowning their brows as soon as the guests appeared on the scene these exquisite little creatures commenced their dance each one taking a trail of blossom or a ribbon pendant from the maypole and weaving it with the others into no end of beautiful and fantastic designs i looked on as amazed and fascinated as anyone present at the wonderful lightness and ease with which these children tripped and rantheir tiny twinkling feet seemed scarcely to touch the turftheir faces were so lovelytheir eyes so bright that it was a positive enchantment to watch them each figure they executed was more intricate and effective than the last and the plaudits of the spectators grew more and more enthusiastic till presently came the finale in which all the little green foresters climbed up the pole and clung there pelting the whiterobed maidens below with cowslipballs knots of roses bunches of violets posies of buttercups daisies and clover which the girlchildren in their turn laughingly threw among the admiring guests the air grew thick with flowers and heavy with perfume and resounded with song and laughterand sibyl standing at my side clapped her hands in an ecstasy oh it is lovelylovely she criedis this the princes idea then as i answered in the </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> the affirmative she added where i wonder did he find such exquisitely pretty little children as she spoke lucio himself advanced a step or two in front of the other spectators and made a slight peremptory sign the fairylike foresters and maidens with extraordinary activity all sprang away from the maypole pulling down the garlands with them and winding the flowers and ribbons about themselves so that they looked as if they were all tied together in one inextricable knotthis done they started off at a rapid run presenting the appearance of a rolling ball of blossom merry pipemusic accompanying their footsteps till they had entirely disappeared among the trees oh do call them back again entreated sibyl laying her hand coaxingly on lucios armi should so like to speak to two or three of the prettiest he looked down at her with an enigmatical smile you would do them too much honour lady sibyl he repliedthey are not accustomed to such condescension from great ladies and would not appreciate it they are paid professionals and like many of their class only become insolent when praised at that moment diana chesney came running across the lawn breathless i cant see them anywhere she declared pantinglythe dear little darlings i ran after them as fast as i could i wanted to kiss one of those perfectly scrumptious boys but theyre gonenot a trace of them left its just as if they had sunk into the ground again lucio smiled they have their orders he said curtlyand they know their place just then the sun was obscured by a passing black cloud and a peal of thunder rumbled overhead looks were turned to the sky but it was quite bright and placid save for that one floating shadow of storm only summer thundersaid one of the gueststhere will be no rain and the crowd that had been pressed together to watch the maypole dance began to break up in groups and speculate as to what diversion might next be provided for them i watching my opportunity drew sibyl away come down by the riveri whisperedi must have you to myself for a few minutes she yielded to my suggestion and we walked away from the mob of our acquaintance and entered a grove of trees leading to the banks of that part of the avon which flowed through my grounds here we found ourselves quite alone and putting my arm round my betrothed i kissed her tenderly tell me i said with a halfsmiledo you know how to love yet she looked up with a passionate darkness in her eyes that startled me yesi know was her unexpected answer you do and i stopped to gaze intently into her fair faceand how did you learn she flushed redthen grew paleand clung to me with a nervous almost feverish force very strangely she repliedandquite suddenly the lesson was easy i foundtoo easy geoffreyshe paused and fixed her eyes full on minei will tell you how i learnt it but not now some other day here she broke off and began to laugh rather forcedly i will tell you when we are married she glanced anxiously about herthen with a sudden abandonment of her usual reserve and pride threw herself into my arms and kissed my lips with such ardour as made my senses reel sibylsibyl i murmured holding her close to my heartoh my darlingyou love meat last you love me hushhush she said breathlesslyyou must forget that kissit was too bold of meit was wrongi did not mean it i i was thinking of something else geoffreyand her small hand clenched on mine with a sort of eager fiercenessi wish i had never learned to love i was happier before i knew a frown knitted her brows nowshe went on in the same breathless hurried wayi want love i am starving thirsting for it i want to be drowned in it lost in it killed by it nothing else will content me i folded her still closer in my arms did i not say you would change sibyl i whisperedyour coldness and insensibility to love was unnatural and could not lastmy darling i always knew that you always knew she echoed a little disdainfullyah but you do not know even now what has chanced to me nor shall i tell youyet oh geoffrey here she drew herself out of my embrace and stooping gathered some bluebells in the grasssee these little flowers growing so purely and peacefully in the shade by the avonthey remind me of what i was here in this very place long ago i was quite as happy and i think as innocent as these blossoms i had no thought of evil in my natureand the only love i dreamed of was the love of the fairy prince for the fairy princessas harmless an idea as the loves of the flowers themselves yesi was then all i should like to be nowall that i am not you are everything that is beautiful and sweeti told her admiringly as i watched the play of retrospective and tender expression on her perfect face so you judgebeing a man who is perfectly satisfied with his own choice of a wife she said with a flash of her old cynicismbut i know myself better than you know me you call me beautiful and sweetbut you cannot call me good i am not good why the very love that now consumes me is what i asked her quickly seizing her hands with the bluebells in them and gazing searchingly into her eyesi know before you speak that it is the passion and tenderness of a true woman she was silent for a moment then she smiled with a bewitching languor if you know then i need not tell youshe saidso do not let us stay here any longer talking nonsensesociety will shake its head over us and accuse us of bad form and some ladyparagraphist will write to the papers and saymr tempests conduct as a host left much to be desired as he and his brideelect were spooning all the day there are no ladyparagraphists herei said laughing and encircling her dainty waist with one arm as i walked oh are there not though she exclaimed laughing also why you dont suppose you can give any sort of big entertainment without them do you they permeate society old lady maravale for example who is rather reduced in circumstances writes a guineas worth of scandal a week for one of the papers and she is herei saw her simply gorging herself with chicken salad and truffles an hour ago here pausing and resting against my arm she peered through the trees there are the chimneys of lily cottage where the famous mavis clare lives she said yes i knowi replied readilyrimnez and i have visited her she is away just now or she would have been here today do you like her sibyl queried very much she is charming and the prince does he like her well upon my word i answered with a smilei think he likes her more than he does most women he showed the most extraordinary deference towards her and seemed almost abashed in her presence are you cold sibyl i added hastily for she shivered suddenly and her face grew paleyou had better come away from the riverit is damp under these trees yeslet us go back to the gardens and the sunshineshe answered dreamilyso your eccentric friendthe womanhaterfinds something to admire in mavis clare she must be a very happy creature i thinkperfectly free famous and believing in all good things of life and humanity if one may judge from her books well taken altogether life isnt so very bad i observed playfully she made no replyand we returned to the lawns where afternoon tea was now being served to the guests who were seated in brilliant scattered groups under the trees or within the silken pavilions while the sweetest musicand the strangest if people had only had ears to hear itboth vocal and instrumental was being performed by those invisible players and singers whose secret whereabouts was unknown to all save lucio xxiv just as the sun began to sink several little pages came out of the house and with low salutations distributed among the guests daintily embossed and painted programmes of the tableaux vivants prepared for their diversion in the extemporized bijou theatre numbers of people rose at once from their chairs on the lawn eager for this new spectacle and began to scramble along and hustle one another in that effective style of highbreeding so frequently exhibited at her majestys drawingrooms i with sibyl hastily preceded the impatient pushing crowd for i wished to find a good seat for my beautiful betrothed before the room became full to overflowing there proved however to be plenty of accommodation for everybodywhat space there was seemed capable of limitless expansion and all the spectators were comfortably placed without difficulty soon we were all studying our programmes with considerable interest for the titles of the tableaux were somewhat original and mystifying they were eight in number and were respectively headedsocietybravery ancient and moderna lost angelthe autocrata corner of hellseeds of corruptionhis latest purchaseand faith and materialism it was in the theatre that everyone became at last conscious of the weirdly </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> weirdly beautiful character of the music that had been surging round them all day seated under one roof in more or less enforced silence and attention the vague and frivolous throng grew hushed and passivethe society smirk passed off certain faces that were as trained to grin as their tongues were trained to liethe dreadful giggle of the unwedded manhunter was no longer heardand soon the most exaggerated fashionplate of a woman forgot to rustle her gown the passionate vibrations of a violoncello superbly played to a double harp accompaniment throbbed on the stillness with a beseeching depth of soundand people listened i saw almost breathlessly entranced as it were against their wills and staring as though they were hypnotized in front of them at the gold curtain with its familiar motto all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players before we had time to applaud the violoncello solo however the music changedand the mirthful voices of violins and flutes rang out in a waltz of the giddiest and sweetest tune at the same instant a silvery bell tinkled and the curtain parted noiselessly in twain disclosing the first tableausociety an exquisite female figure arrayed in eveningdress of the richest and most extravagant design stood before us her hair crowned with diamonds and her bosom blazing with the same lustrous gems her head was slightly raisedher lips were parted in a languid smilein one hand she held uplifted a glass of foaming champagneher goldslippered foot trod on an hourglass behind her catching convulsively at the folds of her train crouched another woman in rags pinched and wretched with starvation depicted in her facea dead child lay near and overshadowing this group were two supernatural shapesone in scarlet the other in blackvast and almost beyond the stature of humanitythe scarlet figure represented anarchy and its bloodred fingers were advanced to clutch the diamond crown from societys browthe sablerobed form was death and even as we looked it slowly raised its steely dart in act to strike the effect was weird and wonderfuland the grim lesson the picture conveyed was startling enough to make a very visible impression no one spokeno one applaudedbut people moved restlessly and fidgetted on their seatsand there was an audible sigh of relief as the curtain closed opening again it displayed the second tableaubraveryancient and modern this was in two scenesthe first one depicted a nobleman of elizabeths time with rapier drawn his foot on the prostrate body of a coarse ruffian who had evidently from the grouping insulted a woman whose slight figure was discerned shrinking timidly away from the contest this was ancient braveryand it changed rapidly to modern showing us an enervated narrowshouldered pallid dandy in operacoat and hat smoking a cigarette and languidly appealing to a bulky policeman to protect him from another young noodle of his own class similarly attired who was represented as sneaking round a corner in abject terror we all recognised the force of the application and were in a much better humour with this pictured satire than we had been at the lesson of society next followed a lost angel in which was shown a great hall in the palace of a king where there were numbers of brilliantly attired people all grouped in various attitudes and evidently completely absorbed in their own concerns so much so as to be entirely unconscious of the fact that in their very midst stood a wondrous angel clad in dazzling white with a halo round her fair hair and a glory as of the sunset on her half drooping wings her eyes were wistfulher face was pensive and expectant she seemed to say will the world ever know that i am here somehowas the curtain slowly closed again amid loud applause for the picture was extraordinarily beautiful i thought of mavis clare and sighed sibyl looked up at me why do you sigh she saidit is a lovely fancybut the symbol is wasted in the present audienceno one with education believes in angels nowadays true i assented yet there was a heaviness at my heart for her words reminded me of what i would rather have forgottennamely her own admitted lack of all religious faith the autocrat was the next tableau and represented an emperor enthroned at his footstool knelt a piteous crowd of the starving and oppressed holding up their lean hands to him clasped in anguished petition but he looked away from them as though he saw them not his head was turned to listen to the sidewhisper of one who seemed by the courtly bend and flattering smile to be his adviser and confidantyet that very confidant held secreted behind his back a drawn dagger ready to strike his sovereign to the heart russia whispered one or two of the company as the scene was obscured but the scarcelybreathed suggestion quickly passed into a murmur of amazement and awe as the curtain parted again to disclose a corner of hell this tableau was indeed original and quite unlike what might have been imagined as the conventional treatment of such a subject what we saw was a black and hollow cavern glittering alternately with the flashings of ice and firehuge icicles drooped from above and pale flames leaped stealthily into view from below and within the dark embrasure the shadowy form of a man was seated counting out gold or what seemed to be gold yet as coin after coin slipped through his ghostly fingers each one was seen to change to fireand the lesson thus pictured was easily read the lost soul had made its own torture and was still at work intensifying and increasing its own fiery agony much as this scene was admired for its rembrandt effect of light and shade i personally was glad when it was curtained from view there was something in the dreadful face of the doomed sinner that reminded me forcibly and unpleasantly of those ghastly three i had seen in my horrid vision on the night of viscount lyntons suicide seeds of corruption was the next picture and showed us a young and beautiful girl in her early teens lying on a luxurious couch en deshabille with a novel in her hand of which the title was plainly seen by alla novel wellknown to everyone present and the work of a muchpraised living author round her on the floor and cast carelessly on a chair at her side were other novels of the same sexual typeall their titles turned towards us and the names of their authors equally made manifest what a daring idea said a lady in the seat immediately behind mei wonder if any of those authors are present if they are they wont mind replied the man next to her with a smothered laughthose sort of writers would merely take it as a firstclass advertisement sibyl looked at the tableau with a pale face and wistful eyes that is a true picture she said under her breathgeoffrey it is painfully true i made no answeri thought i knew to what she alluded but alasi did not know how deeply the seeds of corruption had been sown in her own nature or what a harvest they would bring forth the curtain closedto open again almost immediately on his latest purchase here we were shown the interior of a luxurious modern drawingroom where about eight or ten men were assembled in fashionable eveningdress they had evidently just risen from a cardtableand one of them a dissipated looking brute with a wicked smile of mingled satire and triumph on his face was pointing to his purchasea beautiful woman she was clad in glistening white like a bridebut she was bound as prisoners are bound to an upright column on which the grinning head of a marble silenus leered above her her hands were tied tightly togetherwith chains of diamonds her waist was boundwith thick ropes of pearlsa wide collar of rubies encircled her throatand from bosom to feet she was netted about and tiedwith strings of gold and gems her head was flung back defiantly with an assumption of pride and scornher eyes alone expressed shame selfcontempt and despair at her bondage the man who owned this white slave was represented by his attitude as cataloguing and appraising her points for the approval and applause of his comrades whose faces variously and powerfully expressed the differing emotions of lust cruelty envy callousness derision and selfishness more admirably than the most gifted painter could imagine a capital type of most fashionable marriages i heard someone say rather another voice repliedthe orthodox happy couple to the life i glanced at sibyl she looked palebut smiled as she met my questioning eyes a sense of consolation crept warmly about my heart as i remembered that now she had as she told me learnt to loveand that therefore her marriage with me was no longer a question of material advantage alone she was not my purchaseshe was my love my saint my queenor so i chose to think in my foolishness and vanity the last tableau of all was now to comefaith and materialism and it proved to be the most startling of the series the auditorium was gradually darkenedand the dividing curtain disclosed a ravishingly beautiful scene by the seashore a full moon cast its tranquil glory over the </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> the smooth waters andrising on rainbowwings from earth towards the skies one of the loveliest creatures ever dreamed of by poet or painter floated angellike upwards her hands holding a cluster of lilies clasped to her breasther lustrous eyes full of divine joy hope and love exquisite music was heardsoft voices sang in the distance a chorale of rejoicingheaven and earth sea and airall seemed to support the aspiring spirit as she soared higher and higher in everdeepening rapture whenas we all watched that aerial flying form with a sense of the keenest delight and satisfactiona sudden crash of thunder soundedthe scene grew darkand there was a distant roaring of angry waters the light of the moon was eclipsedthe music ceased a faint lurid glow of red shone at first dimly then more vividlyand materialism declared itselfa human skeleton bleached white and grinning ghastly mirth upon us all while we yet looked the skeleton itself dropped to piecesand one long twining worm lifted its slimy length from the wreck of bones another working its way through the eyeholes of the skull murmurs of genuine horror were heard in the auditoriumpeople on all sides rose from their seatsone man in particular a distinguished professor of sciences pushed past me to get out muttering crosslythis may be very amusing to some of you but to me it is disgusting like your own theories my dear professor said a rich laughing voice as lucio met him on his way and the bijou theatre was again flooded with cheerful lightthey are amusing to some and disgusting to otherspardon mei speak of course in jest but i designed that tableau specially in your honour oh you did did you growled the professorwell i didnt appreciate it yet you should have done for it is quite scientifically correctdeclared lucio laughing still faithwith the wings whom you saw joyously flying towards an impossible heaven is not scientifically correcthave you not told us sobut the skeleton and the worms were quite of your cult no materialist can deny the correctness of that complexion to which we all must come at last positively some of the ladies look quite pale how droll it is that while everybody to be fashionable and in favour with the press must accept materialism as the only creed they should invariably become affrighted or let us say offended at the natural end of the body as completed by material agencies well it was not a pleasant subject that last tableausaid lord elton as he came out of the theatre with diana chesney hanging confidingly on his armyou cannot say it was festal it wasfor the worms replied lucio gailycome miss chesneyand you tempest come along with lady sibyllet us go out in the grounds again and see my willothewisps lighting up fresh curiosity was excited by this remark the people quickly threw off the gruesome and tragic impression made by the strange tableaux just witnessedand poured out of the house into the gardens chattering and laughing more noisily than ever it was just duskand as we reached the open lawn we saw an extraordinary number of small boys clad in brown running about with willothewisp lanterns their movements were swift and perfectly noiselessthey leaped jumped and twirled like little gnomes over flowerbeds under shrubberies and along the edges of paths and terraces many of them climbing trees with the rapidity and agility of monkeys and wherever they went they left behind them a trail of brilliant light soon by their efforts all the grounds were illuminated with a magnificence that could not have been equalled even by the historic ftes at versaillestall oaks and cedars were transformed to pyramids of fireblossomsevery branch was loaded with coloured lamps in the shape of starsrockets hissed up into the clear space showering down bouquets wreaths and ribbons of flamelines of red and azure ran glowingly along the grassborders and amid the enthusiastic applause of the assembled spectators eight huge firefountains of all colours sprang up in various corners of the garden while an enormous golden balloon dazzlingly luminous ascended slowly into the air and remained poised above us sending from its glittering car hundreds of gemlike birds and butterflies on fiery wings that circled round and round for a moment and then vanished while we were yet loudly clapping the splendid effect of this skyspectacle a troop of beautiful girldancers in white came running across the grass waving long silvery wands that were tipped with electric stars and to the sound of strange tinkling music seemingly played in the distance on glass bells they commenced a fantastic dance of the wildest yet most graceful character every shade of opaline colour fell upon their swaying figures from some invisible agency as they tripped and whirledand each time they waved their wands ribbons and flags of fire were unrolled and tossed high in air where they gyrated for a long time like moving hieroglyphs the scene was now so startling so fairylike and wonderful that we were wellnigh struck speechless with astonishmenttoo fascinated and absorbed even to applaud we had no conception how time went or how rapidly the night descendedtill all at once without the least warning an appalling crash of thunder burst immediately above our heads and a jagged fork of lightning tore the luminous fireballoon to shreds two or three women began to screamwhereupon lucio advanced from the throng of spectators and stood in full view of all holding up his hand stage thunder i assure you he said playfully in a clear somewhat scornful voiceit comes and goes at my bidding quite a part of the game believe methese sort of things are only toys for children againagain ye petty elements he cried laughing and lifting his handsome face and flashing eyes to the dark heavensroar your best and loudestroar i say such a terrific boom and clatter answered him as baffled all descriptionit was as if a mountain of rock had fallen into ruinsbut having been assured that the deafening noise was stage thunder merely the spectators were no longer alarmed and many of them expressed their opinion that it was wonderfully well done after this there gradually appeared against the sky a broad blaze of red light like the reflection of some great prairie fireit streamed apparently upward from the ground bathing us all where we stood in its bloodlike glow the whiterobed dancinggirls waltzed on and on their arms entwined their lovely faces irradiated by the lurid flame while above them now flew creatures with black wings bats and owls and great nightmoths that flapped and fluttered about for all the world as if they were truly alive and not mere stage properties another flash of lightningand one more booming thud of thunderand lothe undisturbed and fragrant night was about us clear dewy and calmthe young moon smiled pensively in a cloudless heavenall the dancinggirls had vanishedthe crimson glow had changed to a pure silvery radiance and an array of pretty pages in eighteenth century costumes of pale pink and blue stood before us with lighted flaming torches making a long triumphal avenue down which lucio invited us to pass on on fair ladies and gallant gentlemen he criedthis extemporized path of light leadsnot to heavenno that were far too dull an endingbut to supper onfollow your leader every eye was turned on his fine figure and striking countenance as with one hand he beckoned the guestsbetween the double line of lit torches he stooda picture for a painter with those dark eyes of his alit with such strange mirth as could not be defined and the sweet halfcruel wonderfully attractive smile playing upon his lipsand with one accord the whole company trooped pellmell after him shouting their applause and delight who could resist himnot one in that assemblage at leastthere are few saints in society as i went with the rest i felt as though i were in some gorgeous dreammy senses were all in a whirli was giddy with excitement and could not stop to think or to analyse the emotions by which i was governed had i possessed the force or the will to pause and consider i might possibly have come to the conclusion that there was something altogether beyond the ordinary power of man displayed in the successive wonders of this brilliant galabut i was like all the rest of society bent merely on the pleasure of the moment regardless of how it was procured what it cost me or how it affected others how many i see and know today among the worshippers of fashion and frivolity who are acting precisely as i acted then indifferent to the welfare of everyone save themselves grudging every penny that is not spent on their own advantage or amusement and too callous to even listen to the sorrows or difficulties or joys of others when these do not in some way near or remote touch their own interests they waste their time day after day in selfish trifling wilfully blind and unconscious to the fact that they are building up their own fate in the futurethat future which will prove all the more a terrible reality in proportion to the extent of our presumption in daring to doubt its truth more than four hundred guests sat down to supper in the largest paviliona supper served in the most costly manner </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> manner and furnished with luxuries that represented the utmost pitch of extravagance i ate and drank with sybil at my side hardly knowing what i said or did in the whirling excitement of the hourthe opening of champagnebottles the clink of glasses the clatter of plates the loud hum of talk interspersed with monkeylike squeals or goatlike whinnies of laughter overridden at intervals by the blare of trumpetmusic and drumsall these sounds were as so much noise of rushing waters in my earsand i often found myself growing abstracted and in a manner confused by the din i did not say much to sibylone cannot very well whisper sentimental nothings in the ear of ones betrothed when she is eating ortolans and truffles presently amid all the hubbub a deep bell struck twelve times and lucio stood up at the end of one of the long tables a full glass of foaming champagne in his hand ladies and gentlemen there was a sudden silence ladies and gentlemen he repeated his brilliant eyes flashing derisively i thought over the whole wellfed company midnight has struck and the best of friends must part but before we do so let us not forget that we have met here to wish all happiness to our host mr geoffrey tempest and his brideelect the lady sibyl elton here there was vociferous applause it is saidcontinued lucio by the makers of dull maxims that fortune never comes with both hands fullbut in this case the adage is proved false and put to shamefor our friend has not only secured the pleasures of wealth but the treasures of love and beauty combined limitless cash is good but limitless love is better and both these choice gifts have been bestowed on the betrothed pair whom today we honour i will ask you to give them a hearty round of cheeringand then it must be goodnight indeed though not farewellfor with the toast of the bride and bridegroomelect i shall also drink to the timenot far distant perhapswhen i shall see some of you if not all of you again and enjoy even more of your charming company than i have done today he ceased amid a perfect hurricane of applauseand then everyone rose and turned towards the table where i sat with sibyl and naming our names aloud drank wine the men joining in hearty shouts of hip hip hip hurrah yetas i bowed repeatedly in response to the storm of cheering and while sibyl smiled and bent her graceful head to right and left my heart sank suddenly with a sense of fear was it my fancyor did i hear peals of wild laughter circling round the brilliant pavilion and echoing away far away into distance i listened glass in hand hip hip hip hurrah shouted my guests with gusto haha haha seemed shrieked and yelled in my ears from the outer air struggling against this delusion i got up and returned thanks for myself and my future bride in a few brief words which were received with fresh salvos of applauseand then we all became aware that lucio had sprung up again in his place and was standing high above us all with one foot on the table and the other on the chair confronting us with a fresh glass of wine in his hand filled to the brim what a face he had at that momentwhat a smile the parting cup my friends he exclaimedto our next merry meeting with plaudits and laughter the guests eagerly and noisily respondedand as they drank the pavilion was flooded by a deep crimson illumination as of fire every face looked bloodredevery jewel on every woman flashed like a living flamefor one brief instant onlythen it was gone and there followed a general stampede of the companyeverybody hurrying as fast as they could into the carriages that waited in long lines to take them to the station the last two special trains to london being at one am and one thirty i bade sibyl and her father a hurried goodnightdiana chesney went in the same carriage with them full of ecstatic thanks and praise to me for the splendours of the day which she described in her own fashion as knowing how to do it and then the departing crowd of vehicles began to thunder down the avenue as they went an arch of light suddenly spanned willowsmere court from end to end of its red gables blazing with all the colours of the rainbow in the middle of which appeared letters of pale blue and gold forming what i had hitherto considered as a funereal device sic transit gloria mundi vale but after all it was as fairly applicable to the ephemeral splendours of a fte as it was to the more lasting marble solemnity of a sepulchre and i thought little or nothing about it so perfect were all the arrangements and so admirably were the servants trained that the guests were not long in departingand the grounds were soon not only empty but dark not a vestige of the splendid illuminations was left anywhereand i entered the house fatigued and with a dull sense of bewilderment and fear on me which i could not explain i found lucio alone in the smokingroom at the further end of the oakpanelled hall a small cosily curtained apartment with a deep bay window which opened directly on to the lawn he was standing in this embrasure with his back to me but he turned swiftly round as he heard my steps and confronted me with such a wild white tortured face that i recoiled from him startled lucio you are ill i exclaimedyou have done too much today perhaps i have he answered in a hoarse unsteady voice and i saw a strong shudder convulse him as he spokethen gathering himself together as it were by an effort he forced a smiledont be alarmed my friendit is nothingnothing but the twinge of an old deepseated maladya troublesome disease that is rare among men and hopelessly incurable what is it i asked anxiously for his deathlike pallor alarmed me he looked at me fixedly his eyes dilating and darkening and his hand fell with a heavy pressure on my shoulder a very strange illness he said in the same jarring accents remorse have you never heard of it geoffrey neither medicine nor surgery are of any availit is the worm that dieth not and the flame that cannot be quenched tutlet us not talk of itno one can cure meno one will i am past hope but remorseif you have it and i cannot possibly imagine why for you have surely nothing to regretis not a physical ailment i said wonderingly and physical ailments are the only ones worth troubling about you think he queried still smiling that strained and haggard smilethe body is our chief carewe cosset it and make much of it feed it and pamper it and guard it from so much as a pinprick of pain if we canand thus we flatter ourselves that all is wellall must be well yet it is but a clay chrysalis bound to split and crumble with the growth of the mothsoul withinthe moth that flies with blind instinctiveness straight into the unknown and is dazzled by excess of light look out herehe went on with an abrupt and softer change of tonelook out at the dreamful shadowy beauty of your gardens now the flowers are asleepthe trees are surely glad to be disburdened of all the gaudy artificial lamps that lately hung upon their branchesthere is the young moon pillowing her chin on the edge of a little cloud and sinking to sleep in the westa moment ago there was a late nightingale awake and singing you can feel the breath of the roses from the trellis yonder all this is natures workand how much fairer and sweeter it is now than when the lights were ablaze and the blare of bandmusic startled the small birds in their downy nestsyet society would not appreciate this cool dusk this happy solitudesociety prefers a false glare to all true radiance and what is worse it tries to make true things take a second place as adjuncts to sham onesand there comes in the mischief it is just like you to run down your own indefatigable labours in the splendid successes of the dayi said laughingyou may call it a false glare if you like but it has been a most magnificent spectacleand certainly in the way of entertainments it will never be equalled or excelled it will make you more talked about than even your boomed book could do said lucio eyeing me narrowly not the least doubt of that i repliedsociety prefers food and amusement to any literatureeven the greatest bytheby where are all the artistesthe musicians and dancers gone gone i echoed amazedlyalready good heavens have they had supper they have had everything they want even to their pay said lucio a trifle impatientlydid i not tell you geoffrey that when i undertake to do anything i do it thoroughly or not at all i looked at himhe smiled but his eyes were sombre and scornful all right i responded carelessly not wishing to offend himhave it your own way but upon my word to me it is all like </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> like devils magic what is he asked imperturbably everythingthe dancersthe number of servants and pageswhy there must have been two or three hundred of themthose wonderful tableauxthe illuminationsthe suppereverything i tell youand the most astonishing part of it now is that all these people should have cleared out so soon well if you elect to call money devils magic you are rightsaid lucio but surely in some cases not even money could procure such perfection of detaili began money can procure anythinghe interrupted a thrill of passion vibrating in his rich voicei told you that long ago it is a hook for the devil himself not that the devil could be supposed to care about worlds cash personallybut he generally conceives a liking for the company of the man who possesses itpossibly he knows what that man will do with it i speak metaphorically of coursebut no metaphor can exaggerate the power of money trust no man or womans virtue till you have tried to purchase it with a round sum in hard cash money my excellent geoffrey has done everything for youremember thatyou have done nothing for yourself thats not a very kind speechi said somewhat vexedly no and why because its true i notice most people complain of unkindness when they are told a truth it is true and i see no unkindness in it youve done nothing for yourself and youre not expected to do anythingexcept and he laughedexcept just now to get to bed and dream of the enchanting sibyl i confess i am tiredi said and an unconscious sigh escaped meand you his gaze rested broodingly on the outer landscape i also am tired he responded slowlybut i never get away from my fatigue for i am tired of myself and i always rest badly goodnight goodnight i answeredand then paused looking at him he returned my look with interest well he asked expressively i forced a smile well i echoedi do not know what i should sayexceptthat i wish i knew you as you are i feel that you were right in telling me once that you are not what you seem he still kept his eyes fixed upon me as you have expressed the wishhe said slowlyi promise you you shall know me as i am someday it may be well for you to knowfor the sake of others who may seek to cultivate my company i moved away to leave the room thanks for all the trouble you have taken todayi said in a lighter tonethough i shall never be able to express my full gratitude in words if you wanted to thank anybody thank god that you have lived through it he replied why i asked astonished why because life hangs on a threada society crush is the very acme of boredom and exhaustionand that we escape with our lives from a general guzzle and giggle is matter for thanksgivingthats all and god gets so few thanks as a rule that you may surely spare him a brief one for todays satisfactory ending i laughed seeing no meaning in his words beyond the usual satire he affected i found amiel waiting for me in my bedroom but i dismissed him abruptly hating the look of his crafty and sullen face and saying i needed no attendance thoroughly fatigued i was soon in bed and asleepand the terrific agencies that had produced the splendours of the brilliant festival at which i had figured as host were not revealed to me by so much as a warning dream xxv a few days after the entertainment at willowsmere and before the society papers had done talking about the magnificence and luxury displayed on that occasion i woke up one morning like the great poet byron to find myself famous not for any intellectual achievementnot for any unexpected deed of heroismnot for any resolved or noble attitude in society or politicsnoi owed my fame merely to a quadrupedphosphor won the derby it was about a neckandneck contest between my racer and that of the prime minister and for a second or so the result seemed doubtfulbut as the two jockeys neared the goal amiel whose thin wiry figure clad in the brightest of bright scarlet silk stuck to his horse as though he were a part of it put phosphor to a pace he had never yet exhibited appearing to skim along the ground at literally flying speed the upshot being that he scored a triumphant victory reaching the winningpost a couple of yards or more ahead of his rival acclamations rent the air at the vigour displayed in the finishand i became the hero of the daythe darling of the populace i was somewhat amused at the premiers discomfiturehe took his beating rather badly he did not know me nor i himi was not of his politics and i did not care a jot for his feelings one way or the other but i was gratified in a certain satirical sense to find myself suddenly acknowledged as a greater man than he because i was the owner of the derbywinner before i well knew where i was i found myself being presented to the prince of wales who shook hands with me and congratulated meall the biggest aristocrats in england were willing and eager to be introduced to meand inwardly i laughed at this exhibition of taste and culture on the part of the gentlemen of england that live at home at ease they crowded round phosphor whose wild eye warned strangers against taking liberties with him but who seemed not a whit the worse for his exertions and who apparently was quite ready to run the race over again with equal pleasure and success amiels dark sly face and cruel ferret eyes were evidently not attractive to the majority of the gentlemen of the turf though his answers to all the queries put to him were admirably ready respectful and not without wit but to me the whole sum and substance of the occasion was the fact that i geoffrey tempest once struggling author now millionaire was simply by virtue of my ownership of the derbywinner famous at lastor what society considers famousthat fame that secures for a man the attention of the nobility and gentry to quote from tradesmens advertisementsand also obtains the persistent adulation and shameless pursuit of all the demimondaines who want jewels and horses and yachts presented to them in exchange for a few tainted kisses from their carmined lips under the shower of compliments i received i stood apparently delightedsmiling affable and courteousentering into the spirit of the occasion and shaking hands with my lord that and sir something nobody and his serene highness the grand duke soandso of beerland and his other serene lowness of smallprincipalitybut in my secret soul i scorned these people with their social humbug and hypocrisyscorned them with such a deadly scorn as almost amazed myself when presently i walked off the course with lucio who as usual seemed to know and to be friends with everybody he spoke in accents that were far more grave and gentle than i had ever heard him use before with all your egotism geoffrey there is something forcible and noble in your naturesomething which rises up in bold revolt against falsehood and sham why in heavens name do you not give it way i looked at him amazed and laughed give it way what do you mean would you have me tell humbugs that i know them as suchand liars that i discern their lies my dear fellow society would become too hot to hold me it could not be hotteror colderthan hell if you believed in hell which you do nothe rejoined in the same quiet voicebut i did not assume that you should say these things straight out and bluntly to give offence an affronting candour is not noblenessit is merely coarse to act nobly is better than to speak and what would you have me do i asked curiously he was silent for a moment and seemed to be earnestly almost painfully consideringthen he answered my advice will seem to you singular geoffreybut if you want it here it is give as i said the noble and what the world would call the quixotic part of your nature full waydo not sacrifice your higher sense of what is right and just for the sake of pandering to anyones power or influenceandsay farewell to me i am no use to you save to humour your varying fancies and introduce you to those greator smallpersonages you wish to know for your own convenience or advantagebelieve me it would be much better for you and much more consoling at the inevitable hour of death if you were to let all this false and frivolous nonsense go and me with it leave society to its own fools whirligig of distracted folliesput royalty in its true place and show it that all its pomp arrogance and glitter are worthless and itself a nothing compared to the upright standing of a brave soul in an honest manand as christ said to the rich rulersell half that thou hast and give to the poor i was silent for a minute or so out of sheer surprise while he watched me earnestly his face pale and expectant a curious shock of something </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> something like compunction startled my conscience and for a brief space i was moved to a vague regretregret that with all the enormous capability i possessed of doing good to numbers of my fellowcreatures with the vast wealth i owned i had not attained to any higher moral attitude than that represented by the frivolous folk who make up what is called the upper ten of society i took the same egotistical pleasure in myself and my own doings as any of themand i was to the full as foolishly conventional smoothtongued and hypocritical as they they acted their part and i acted minenone of us were ever our real selves for a moment in very truth one of the reasons why fashionable men and women cannot bear to be alone is that a solitude in which they are compelled to look face to face upon their secret selves becomes unbearable because of the burden they carry of concealed vice and accusing shame my emotion soon passed however and slipping my arm through lucios i smiled as i answered your advice my dear fellow would do credit to a salvationist preacherbut it is quite valueless to me because impossible to follow to say farewell for ever to you in the first place would be to make myself guilty of the blackest ingratitudein the second instance society with all its ridiculous humbug is nevertheless necessary for the amusement of myself and my future wiferoyalty moreover is accustomed to be flattered and we shall not be hurt by joining in the general inane chorusthirdly if i did as the visionary jew suggested what visionary jew he asked his eyes sparkling coldly why christ of course i rejoined lightly the shadow of a strange smile parted his lips it is the fashion to blaspheme he saida mark of brilliancy in literature and wit in society i forgot pray go onif you did as christ suggested yesif i gave half my goods to the poor i should not be thanked for it or considered anything but a fool for my pains you would wish to be thanked he said naturally most people like a little gratitude in return for benefits they do and the creator who is always giving is supposed to like gratitude alsohe observednevertheless he seldom gets it i do not talk of hyperphysical nothingnessi said with impatiencei am speaking of the plain facts of this world and the people who live in it if one gives largely one expects to be acknowledged as generousbut if i were to divide my fortune and hand half of it to the poor the matter would be chronicled in about six lines in one of the papers and society would exclaim what a fool then let us talk no more about itsaid lucio his brows clearing and his eyes gathering again their wonted light of mockery and mirthhaving won the derby you have really done all a nineteenthcentury civilization expects you to do and for your reward you will be in universal demand everywhere you may hope soon to dine at marlborough houseand a little backstair influence and political jobbery will work you into the cabinet if you care for it did i not tell you i would set you up as successfully as the bear who has reached the bun on the top of the slippery pole a spectacle for the envy of men and the wonder of angels well there you aretriumphanta great creature geoffreyin fact you are the greatest product of the age a man with five millions and owner of the derbywinner what is the glory of intellect compared to such a position as yours men envy youand as for angelsif there are anyyou may be sure they do wonder a mans fame guaranteed by a horse is something indeed to make an angel stare he laughed uproariously and from that day he never spoke again of his singular proposition that i should part with him and let the nobler nature in me have its way i was not to know then that he had staked a chance upon my soul and lost itand that from henceforward he took a determined course with me implacably on to the appalling end my marriage took place on the appointed day in june with all the pomp and extravagant show befitting my position and that of the woman i had chosen to wed it is needless to describe the gorgeousness of the ceremony in detailany fashionable ladies paper describing the wedding of an earls daughter to a fivefold millionaire will give an idea in hysterical rhapsody of the general effect it was an amazing sceneand one in which costly millinery completely vanquished all considerations of solemnity or sacredness in the supposed divine ordinance the impressive command i require and charge ye both as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgmentdid not obtain half so much awed attention as the exquisite knots of pearls and diamonds which fastened the brides silverembroidered train to her shoulders all the world and his wife were presentthat is the social world which imagines no other world exists though it is the least part of the community the prince of wales honoured us by his presence two great dignitaries of the church performed the marriagerite resplendent in redundant fulness of white sleeve and surplice and equally imposing in the fatness of their bodies and unctuous redness of their faces and lucio was my best man he was in high almost wild spiritsand during our drive to the church together had entertained me all the way with numerous droll stories mostly at the expense of the clergy when we reached the sacred edifice he said laughingly as he alighted did you ever hear it reported geoffrey that the devil is unable to enter a church because of the cross upon it or within it i have heard some such nonsensei replied smiling at the humour expressed in his sparkling eyes and eloquent features it is nonsensefor the makers of the legend forgot one thing he continued dropping his voice to a whisper as we passed under the carved gothic porticothe cross may be presentbutso is the clergyman and wherever a clergyman is the devil may surely follow i almost laughed aloud at his manner of making this irreverent observation and the look with which he accompanied it the rich tones of the organ creeping softly on the flowerscented silence however quickly solemnized my moodand while i leaned against the altarrails waiting for my bride i caught myself wondering for the hundredth time or more at my comrades singularly proud and kingly aspect as with folded arms and lifted head he contemplated the lilydecked altar and the gleaming crucifix upon it his meditative eyes bespeaking a curious mingling of reverence and contempt one incident i remember as standing out particularly in all the glare and glitter of the brilliant scene and this occurred at the signing of our names in the register when sibyl a vision of angelic loveliness in all her bridal white affixed her signature to the entry lucio bent towards her as best man i claim an oldfashioned privilege he said and kissed her lightly on the cheek she blushed a vivid redthen suddenly grew ghastly paleand with a kind of choking cry reeled back in a dead faint in the arms of one of her bridesmaids it was some minutes before she was restored to consciousnessbut she made light both of my alarm and the consternation of her friendsand assuring us that it was nothing but the effect of the heat of the weather and the excitement of the day she took my arm and walked down the aisle smilingly through the brilliant ranks of her staring and envious society friends all of whom coveted her good fortune not because she had married a worthy or gifted manthat would have been no special matter for congratulationbut simply because she had married five millions of money i was the appendage to the millionsnothing further she held her head high and haughtily though i felt her tremble as the thundering strains of the bridal march from lohengrin poured sonorous triumph on the air she trod on roses all the wayi remembered that too afterwards her satin slipper crushed the hearts of a thousand innocent things that must surely have been more dear to god than shethe little harmless souls of flowers whose task in life sweetly fulfilled had been to create beauty and fragrance by their mere existence expired to gratify the vanity of one woman to whom nothing was sacred but i anticipatei was yet in my fools dreamand imagined that the dying blossoms were happy to perish thus beneath her tread a grand reception was held at lord eltons house after the ceremonyand in the midst of the chattering the eating and the drinking wemy newly made wife and ideparted amid the profuse flatteries and good wishes of our friends who primed with the very finest champagne made a very decent show of being sincere the last person to say farewell to us at the carriagedoor was lucioand the sorrow i felt at parting with him was more than i could express in words from the very hour of the dawning of my good fortune we had been almost inseparable companionsi owed my success in societyeverything even </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> even my bride herselfto his management and tactand though i had now won for my lifes partner the most beautiful of women i could not contemplate even the temporary breaking of the association between myself and my gifted and brilliant comrade without a keen pang of personal pain amid my nuptial joys leaning his arms on the carriagewindow he looked in upon us both smiling my spirit will be with you both in all your journeyings he saidand when you return i shall be one of the first to bid you welcome home your houseparty is fixed for september i believe yesand you will be the most eagerly desired guest of all invited i replied heartily pressing his hand fie for shame he retorted laughinglybe not so disloyal of speech geoffrey are you not going to entertain the prince of walesand shall anyone be more eagerlydesired than he noi must play a humble third or even fourth on your list where royalty is concernedmy princedom is alas not that of walesand the throne i might claim if i had anyone to help me which i have not is a long way removed from that of england sibyl said nothingbut her eyes rested on his handsome face and fine figure with an odd wonder and wistfulness and she was very pale goodbye lady sibyl he added gentlyall joy be with you to us who are left behind your absence will seem longbut to youahlove gives wings to time and what would be to ordinary folks a month of mere dull living will be for you nothing but a moments rapture love is better than wealthyou have found that out already i knowbut i thinkand hopethat you are destined to make the knowledge more certain and complete think of me sometimes au revoir the horses starteda handful of rice flung by the society idiot who is always at weddings rattled against the door and on the roof of the brougham and lucio stepped back waving his hand to the last we saw hima tall stately figure on the steps of lord eltons mansionsurrounded by an ultrafashionable throng bridesmaids in bright attire and picturehatsyoung girls all eager and excitedlooking each of them no doubt longing fervently for the day to come when they might severally manage to secure as rich a husband as myself matchmaking mothers and wicked old dowagers exhibiting priceless lace on their capacious bosoms and ablaze with diamonds men with white buttonhole bouquets in their irreproachably fitting frockcoatsservants in gay liveries and the usual streetcrowd of idle sightseersall this cluster of faces costumes and flowers was piled against the grey background of the stone porticoand in the midst the dark beauty of lucios face and the luminance of his flashing eyes made him the conspicuous object and chief centre of attraction then the carriage turned a sharp cornerthe faces vanishedand sibyl and i realised that from henceforward we were left alonealone to face the future and ourselvesand to learn the lesson of love or hate for evermore together xxvi i cannot now trace the slow or swift flitting by of phantasmal events wild ghosts of days or weeks that drifted past and brought me gradually and finally to a time when i found myself wandering numb and stricken and sick at heart by the shores of a lake in switzerlanda small lake densely blue with apparently a thought in its depths such as is reflected in a childs earnest eye i gazed down at the clear and glistening water almost unseeinglythe snowpeaked mountains surrounding it were too high for the lifting of my aching sightloftiness purity and radiance were unbearable to my mind crushed as it was beneath a weight of dismal wreckage and ruin what a fool was i ever to have believed that in this world there could be such a thing as happiness misery stared me in the facelifelong miseryand no escape but death miseryit was the word which like a hellish groan had been uttered by the three dreadful phantoms that had once in an evil vision disturbed my rest what had i done i demanded indignantly of myself to deserve this wretchedness which no wealth could curewhy was fate so unjust like all my kind i was unable to discern the small yet strong links of the chain i had myself wrought and which bound me to my own undoingi blamed fate or rather godand talked of injustice merely because i personally suffered never realizing that what i considered unjust was but the equitable measuring forth of that eternal law which is carried out with as mathematical an exactitude as the movement of the planets notwithstanding mans pigmy efforts to impede its fulfilment the light wind blowing down from the snow peaks above me ruffled the placidity of the little lake by which i aimlessly strolledi watched the tiny ripples break over its surface like the lines of laughter on a human face and wondered morosely whether it was deep enough to drown in for what was the use of living onknowing what i knew knowing that she whom i had loved and whom i loved still in a way that was hateful to myself was a thing viler and more shameless in character than the veriest poor drab of the street who sells herself for current cointhat the lovely body and angelface were but an attractive disguise for the soul of a harpya vulture of vice my godan irrepressible cry escaped me as my thoughts went on and on in the neverending circle and problem of incurable unspeakable despairand i threw myself down on a shelving bank of grass that sloped towards the lake and covered my face in a paroxysm of tearless agony still inexorable thought worked in my brain and forced me to consider my position was shewas sibylmore to blame than i myself for all the strange havoc wrought i had married her of my own free will and choiceand she had told me beforehandi am a contaminated creature trained to perfection in the lax morals and prurient literature of my day welland so it had proved my own blood burned with shame as i reflected how ample and convincing were the proofsand starting up from my recumbent posture i paced up and down again restlessly in a fever of selfcontempt and disgust what could i do with a woman such as she to whom i was now bound for life reform her she would laugh me to scorn for the attempt reform myself she would sneer at me for an effeminate milksop besides was not i as willing to be degraded as she was to degrade mea very victim to my brute passions tortured and maddened by my feelings i roamed about wildly and started as if a pistolshot had been fired near me when the plash of oars sounded on the silence and the keel of a small boat grated on the shore the boatman within it respectfully begging me in mellifluous french to employ him for an hour i assented and in a minute or two was out on the lake in the middle of the red glow of sunset which turned the snowsummits to points of flame and the waters to the hue of ruby wine i think the man who rowed me saw that i was in no very pleasant humour for he preserved a discreet silenceand i pulling my hat partly over my eyes lay back in the stern still busy with my wretched musings only a month marriedand yeta sickening satiety had taken the place of the socalled deathless lovers passion there were moments even when my wifes matchless physical beauty appeared hideous to me i knew her as she wasand no exterior charm could ever again cover for me the revolting nature within and what puzzled me from dawn to dusk was her polished specious hypocrisyher amazing aptitude for lies to look at herto hear her speakone would have deemed her a very saint of puritya delicate creature whom a coarse word would startle and offenda very incarnation of the sweetest and most gracious womanhoodall heart and feeling and sympathy everyone thought thus of herand never was there a greater error heart she had none that fact was borne in upon me two days after our marriage while we were in paris for there a telegram reached us announcing her mothers death the paralysed countess of elton had it appeared expired suddenly on our weddingday or rather our wedding nightbut the earl had deemed it best to wait fortyeight hours before interrupting our hymeneal happiness with the melancholy tidings he followed his telegram by a brief letter to his daughter in which the concluding lines were theseas you are a bride and are travelling abroad i should advise you by no means to go into mourning under the circumstances it is really not necessary and sibyl had readily accepted his suggestion keeping generally however to white and pale mauve colourings in her numerous and wonderful toilettes in order not to outrage the proprieties too openly in the opinions of persons known to her whom she might possibly meet casually in the foreign towns we visited no word of regret passed her lips and no tears were shed for her mothers loss she only said what a good thing her sufferings are over then with </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> with a little sarcastic smile she had added i wonder when we shall receive the eltonchesney wedding cards i did not reply for i was pained and grieved at her lack of all gentle feeling in the matter and i was also to a certain extent superstitiously affected by the fact of the death occurring on our marriageday however this was now a thing of the past a month had elapseda month in which the tearingdown of illusions had gone on daily and hourlytill i was left to contemplate the uncurtained bare prose of life and the knowledge that i had wedded a beautiful feminine animal with the soul of a shameless libertine here i pause and ask myselfwas not i also a libertine yesi freely admit itbut the libertinage of a man while it may run to excess in hot youth generally resolves itself under the influence of a great love into a strong desire for undefiled sweetness and modesty in the woman beloved if a man has indulged in both folly and sin the time comes at last when if he has any good left in him at all he turns back upon himself and lashes his own vices with the scorpionwhip of selfcontempt till he smarts with the rage and pain of itand then aching in every pulse with his deserved chastisement he kneels in spirit at the feet of some pure truehearted woman whose white soul like an angel hovers compassionately above him and there lays down his life saying do what you will with itit is yours and woe to her who plays lightly with such a gift or works fresh injury upon it no man even if he has in his day indulged in rapid living should choose a rapid woman for his wifehe had far better put a loaded pistol to his head and make an end of it the sunsetglory began to fade from the landscape as the little boat glided on over the tranquil water and a great shadow was on my mind like the shadow of that outer darkness which would soon be night again i asked myselfwas there no happiness possible in all the world just then the angelus chimed from a little chapel on the shore and as it rang a memory stirred in my brain moving me wellnigh to tears mavis clare was happymavis with her frank fearless eyes sweet face and bright naturemavis wearing her crown of fame as simply as a child might wear a wreath of mayblossomshe with a merely moderate share of fortune which even in its slight proportion was only due to her own hard incessant workshe was happy and iwith my millionswas wretched how was it why was it what had i done i had lived as my compeers livedi had followed the lead of all societyi had feasted my friends and effectually snubbed my foesi had comported myself exactly as others of my wealth comport themselvesand i had married a woman whom most men looking upon once would have been proud to win nevertheless there seemed to be a curse upon me what had i missed out of life i knewbut was ashamed to own it because i had previously scorned what i called the dreamnothings of mere sentiment and now i had to acknowledge the paramount importance of those dreamnothings out of which all true living must come i had to realize that my marriage was nothing but the mere mating of the male and female animala coarse bodily union and no morethat all the finer and deeper emotions which make a holy thing of human wedlock were lackingthe mutual respect the trusting sympathythe lovely confidence of mind with mindthe subtle inner spiritual bond which no science can analyse and which is so much closer and stronger than the material and knits immortal souls together when bodies decaythese things had no existence and never would exist between my wife and me thus as far as i was concerned there was a strange blankness in the worldi was thrust back upon myself for comfort and found none what should i do with my life i wondered drearily win fametrue fameafter all with sibyls witcheyes mocking my effortsnever if i had ever had any gifts of creative thought within me she would have killed it the hour was overthe boatman rowed me in to land and i paid and dismissed him the sun had completely sunkthere were dense purple shadows darkening over the mountains and one or two small stars faintly discernible in the east i walked slowly back to the villa where we were stayinga dpendance belonging to the large hotel of the district which we had rented for the sake of privacy and independence some of the hotelservants being portioned off to attend upon us in addition to my own man morris and my wifes maid i found sibyl in the garden reclining in a basketchair her eyes fixed on the afterglow of the sunset and in her hands a bookone of the loathliest of the prurient novels that have been lately written by women to degrade and shame their sex with a sudden impulse of rage upon me which i could not resist i snatched the volume from her and flung it into the lake below she made no movement of either surprise or offenceshe merely turned her eyes away from the glowing heavens and looked at me with a little smile how violent you are today geoffrey she said i gazed at her in sombre silence from the light hat with its pale mauve orchids that rested on her nutbrown hair to the point of her daintily embroidered shoe her dress was perfectand she was perfect i knew thata matchless piece of womanhood outwardly my heart beatthere was a sense of suffocation in my throati could have killed her for the mingled loathing and longing which her beauty roused in me i am sorry i said hoarsely avoiding her gazebut i hate to see you with such a book as that you know its contents she queried with the same slight smile i can guess such things have to be written they say nowadaysshe went onand certainly to judge from the commendation bestowed on these sort of books by the press it is very evident that the wave of opinion is setting in the direction of letting girls know all about marriage before they enter upon it in order that they may do so with their eyes wide openvery wide open she laughed and her laughter hurt me like a physical wound what an oldfashioned idea the bride of the poets and sixtyyearsago romancists seems now she continuedimagine hera shrinking tender creature shy of beholders timid of speech wearing the emblematic veil which in former days you know used to cover the face entirely as a symbol that the secrets of marriage were as yet hidden from the maidens innocent and ignorant eyes now the veil is worn flung back from the brides brows and she stares unabashed at everybodyoh yes indeed we know quite well what we are doing now when we marry thanks to the new fiction the new fiction is detestablei said hotlyboth in style and morality even as a question of literature i wonder at your condescending to read any of it the woman whose dirty book i have just thrown awayand i feel no compunction for having done itis destitute of grammar as well as decency oh but the critics dont notice thatshe interrupted with a delicate mockery vibrating in her voiceit is apparently not their business to assist in preserving the purity of the english language what they fall into raptures over is the originality of the sexual theme though i should have thought all such matters were as old as the hills i never read reviews as a rule but i did happen to come across one on the book you have just drownedand in it the reviewer stated he had cried over it she laughed again beast i said emphaticallyhe probably found in it some glozingover of his own vices but you sibylwhy do you read such stuffhow can you read it curiosity moved me in the first placeshe answered listlesslyi wanted to see what makes a reviewer cry then when i began to read i found that the story was all about the manner in which men amuse themselves with the soiled doves of the highways and byewaysand as i was not very well instructed in that sort of thing i thought i might as well learn you know these unpleasant morsels of information on unsavoury subjects are like the reputed suggestions of the devilif you listen to one you are bound to hear more besides literature is supposed to reflect the time we live inand that kind of literature being more prevalent than anything else we are compelled to accept and study it as the mirror of the age with an expression on her face that was half mirth and half scorn she rose from her seat and looked down into the lovely lake below her the fishes will eat that book she observedi hope it will not poison them if they could read and understand it what singular ideas they would have of us human beings why dont you read mavis clares books i asked suddenlyyou told </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> told me you admired her so i doimmensely she answeredi admire her and wonder at her both together how that woman can keep her childs heart and childs faith in a world like this is more than i can understand it is always a perfect marvel to mea sort of supernatural surprise you ask me why dont i read her booksi do read themive read them all over and over againbut she does not write many and one has to wait for her productions longer than for those of most authors when i want to feel like an angel i read mavis clarebut i more often am inclined to feel the other way and then her books are merely so many worries to me worries i echoed yes it is worrying to find somebody believing in a god when you cant believe in himto have beautiful faiths offered to you which you cant graspand to know that there is a creature alive a woman like yourself in everything except mind who is holding fast a happiness which you can never attainno not though you held out praying hands day and night and shouted wild appeals to the dull heavens at that moment she looked like a queen of tragedyher violet eyes ablazeher lips aparther breast heavingi approached her with a strange nervous hesitation and touched her hand she gave it to me passivelyi drew it through my arm and for a minute or two we paced silently up and down the gravel walk the lights from the monster hotel which catered for us and our wants were beginning to twinkle from basement to roofand just above the chlet we rented a triad of stars sparkled in the shape of a trefoil poor geoffrey she said presently with a quick upward glance at mei am sorry for you with all my vagaries of disposition i am not a fool and at anyrate i have learned how to analyse myself as well as others i read you as easily as i read a booki see what a strange tumult your mind is in you love meand you loathe meand the contrast of emotion makes a wreck of you and your ideals hushdont speak i knowi know but what would you have me be an angel i cannot realize such a being for more than a fleeting moment of imagination a saint they were all martyred a good woman i never met one innocentignorant i told you before we married that i was neither there is nothing left for me to discover as far as the relations between men and women are concernedi have taken the measure of the inherent love of vice in both sexes there is not a pin to choose between themmen are no worse than womenwomen no worse than men i have discovered everythingexcept godand i conclude no god could ever have designed such a crazy and mean business as human life while she thus spoke i could have fallen at her feet and implored her to be silent for she was unknowingly giving utterance to some of the many thoughts in which i myself had frequently indulgedand yet from her lips they sounded cruel unnatural and callous to a degree that made me shrink from her in fear and agony we had reached a little grove of pinesand here in the silence and shadow i took her in my arms and stared disconsolately upon the beauty of her face sibyl i whisperedsibyl what is wrong with us both how is it that we do not seem to find the loveliest side of lovewhy is it that even in our kisses and embraces some impalpable darkness comes between us so that we anger or weary each other when we should be glad and satisfied what is it can you tell for you know the darkness is there a curious look came into her eyesa faraway strained look of hungry yearning mingled as i thought with compassion for me yes it is there she answered slowlyand it is of our own mutual creation i believe you have something nobler in your nature geoffrey than i have in minean indefinable something that recoils from me and my theories despite your wish and will perhaps if you had given way to that feeling in time you would never have married me you speak of the loveliest side of loveto me there is no lovely sideit is all coarse and horrible you and i for instancecultured man and womanwe cannot in marriage get a flight beyond the common emotions of hodge and his girl she laughed violently and shuddered in my arms what liars the poets are geoffrey they ought to be sentenced to lifelong imprisonment for their perjuries they help to mould the credulous beliefs of a womans heartin her early youth she reads their delicious assurances and imagines that love will be all they teacha thing divine and lasting beyond earthly countingsthen comes the coarse finger of prose on the butterflywing of poesy and the bitterness and hideousness of complete disillusion i held her still in my arms with the fierce grasp of a man clinging to a spar ere he drowns in midocean but i love you sibylmy wife i love you i said with a passion that choked my utterance you love meyes i know but how in a way that is abhorrent to yourself she repliedit is not poetic loveit is mans love and mans love is brute love so it isso it will beso it must be moreover the brutelove soon tiresand when it dies out from satiety there is nothing left nothing geoffreyabsolutely nothing but a blank and civil form of intercourse which i do not doubt we shall be able to keep up for the admiration and comment of society she disengaged herself from my embrace and moved towards the house come she added turning her exquisite head back over her shoulder with a feline caressing grace that she alone possessed you know there is a famous lady in london who advertises her saleable charms to the outside public by means of her monogram worked into the lace of all her windowblinds thinking it no doubt good for trade i am not quite so bad as that you have paid dearly for me i knowbut remember i as yet wear no jewels but yours and crave no gifts beyond those you are generous enough to bestowand my dutiful desire is to give you as much full value as i can for your money sibyl you kill me i cried tortured beyond endurance do you think me so base i broke off with almost a sob of despair you cannot help being base she said steadily regarding mebecause you are a man i am base because i am a woman if we believed in a god either of us we might discover some different way of life and lovewho knowsbut neither you nor i have any remnant of faith in a being whose existence all the scientists of the day are ever at work to disprove we are persistently taught that we are animals and nothing morelet us therefore not be ashamed of animalism animalism and atheism are approved by the scientists and applauded by the pressand the clergy are powerless to enforce the faith they preach come geoffrey dont stay mooning like a stricken parsifal under those pinesthrow away that thing which troubles you your consciencethrow it away as you have thrown the book i was lately reading and consider thisthat most men of your type take pride and rejoice in being the prey of a bad womanso you should really congratulate yourself on having one for a wifeone who is so broadminded too that she will always let you have your own way in everything you do provided you let her have hers it is the way all marriages are arranged nowadaysat any rate in our setotherwise the tie would be impossible of endurance come we cannot live together on such an understanding sibyl i said hoarsely as i walked slowly by her side towards the villa oh yes we can she averred a little malign smile playing round her lipswe can do as others dothere is no necessity for us to stand out from the rest like quixotic fools and pose as models to other married peoplewe should only be detested for our pains it is surely better to be popular than virtuousvirtue never pays see there is our interesting german waiter coming to inform us that dinner is ready please dont look so utterly miserable for we have not quarrelled and it would be foolish to let the servants think we have i made no answer we entered the house and dinedsibyl keeping up a perfect fire of conversation to which i replied in mere monosyllablesand after dinner we went as usual to sit in the illuminated gardens of the adjacent hotel and hear the band sibyl was known and universally admired and flattered by many of the people staying thereand as she moved about among her acquaintances chatting first with one group and then with another i sat in moody silence watching her with increasing wonderment and horror her beauty seemed to me like the beauty of the poisonflower which brilliant in colour and perfect in shape exhales death to those who </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> who pluck it from its stem and that night when i held her in my arms and felt her heart beating against my own in the darkness an awful dread arose in mea dread as to whether i might not at some time or other be tempted to strangle her as she lay on my breaststrangle her as one would strangle a vampire that sucked ones blood and strength away xxvii we concluded our weddingtour rather sooner than we had at first intended and returned to england and willowsmere court about the middle of august i had a vague notion stirring in me that gave me a sort of dim indefinable consolation and it was thisi meant to bring my wife and mavis clare together believing that the gentle influence of the gracious and happy creature who like a contented bird in its nest dwelt serene in the little domain so near my own might have a softening and wholesome effect upon sibyls pitiless love of analysis and scorn of all noble ideals the heat in warwickshire was at this time intensethe roses were out in their full beauty and the thick foliage of the branching oaks and elms in my grounds afforded grateful shade and repose to the tired body while the tranquil loveliness of the woodland and meadow scenery comforted and soothed the equally tired mind after all there is no country in the world so fair as englandnone so richly endowed with verdant forests and fragrant flowersnone that can boast of sweeter nooks for seclusion and romance in italy that land so overpraised by hysterical poseurs who foolishly deem it admirable to glorify any country save their own the fields are arid and brown and parched by the too fervent sunthere are no shady lanes such as england can boast of in all her shiresand the mania among italians for ruthlessly cutting down their finest trees has not only actually injured the climate but has so spoilt the landscape that it is difficult to believe at all in its once renowned and still erroneously reported charm such a bower of beauty as lily cottage was in that sultry august could never have been discovered in all the length and breadth of italy mavis superintended the care of her gardens herselfshe had two gardeners who under her directions kept the grass and trees continually wateredand nothing could be imagined more lovely than the picturesque oldfashioned house covered with roses and tufts of jessamine that seemed to tie up the roof in festal knots and garlands while around the building spread long reaches of deep emerald lawn and bosky arbours of foliage where all the most musical songbirds apparently found refuge and delight and where at evening a perfect colony of nightingales kept up a bubbling fountain of delicious melody i remember well the afternoon warm languid and still when i took sibyl to see the womanauthor she had so long admired the heat was so great that in our own grounds all the birds were silent but when we approached lily cottage the first thing we heard was the piping of a thrush up somewhere among the rosesa mellow liquid warble expressing sweet content and mingling with the subdued coocooings of the dove reviewers who were commenting on whatever pleased or displeased them in the distance what a pretty place it is said my wife as she peeped over the gate and through the odorous tangles of honeysuckle and jessaminei really think it is prettier than willowsmere it has been wonderfully improved we were shown inand mavis who had expected our visit did not keep us waiting long an she entered clad in some gossamer white stuff that clung softly about her pretty figure and was belted in by a simple ribbon an odd sickening pang went through my heart the fair untroubled facethe joyous yet dreamy student eyesthe sensitive mouth and above all the radiant look of happiness that made the whole expression of her features so bright and fascinating taught me in one flash of conviction all that a woman might be and all that she too frequently is not and i had hated mavis clarei had even taken up my pen to deal her a wanton blow through the medium of anonymous criticism but this was before i knew herbefore i realized that there could be any difference between her and the female scarecrows who so frequently pose as novelists without being able to write correct english and who talk in public of their copy with the glibness gained from grub street and the journalists cheap restaurant yesi had hated herand nownow almost i loved her sibyl tall queenly and beautiful gazed upon her with eyes that expressed astonishment as well as admiration to think that you are the famous mavis clare she said smiling as she held out her handi always heard and knew that you did not look at all literary but i never quite realized that you could be exactly what i see you are to look literary does not always imply that you are literary returned mavis laughing a littletoo often i am afraid you will find that the women who take pains to look literary are ignorant of literature but how glad i am to see you lady sibyl do you know i used to watch you playing about on the lawns at willowsmere when i was quite a little girl and i used to watch youresponded sibylyou used to make daisychains and cowslipballs in the fields opposite on the other side of the avon it is a great pleasure to me to know we are neighbours you must come and see me often at willowsmere mavis did not answer immediatelyshe busied herself in pouring out tea and dispensing it to both of us sibyl who was always on the alert for glimpses of character noticed that she did not answer and repeated her words coaxingly you will come will you not as often as you likethe oftener the better we must be friends you know mavis looked up then a frank sweet smile in her eyes do you really mean it she asked mean it echoed sibylwhy of course i do how can you doubt it i exclaimed well you must both forgive me for asking such a questionsaid mavis still smilingbut you see you are now among what are called the county magnates and county magnates consider themselves infinitely above all authors she laughed outright and her blue eyes twinkled with fun i think many of them estimate writers of books as some sort of strange outgrowth of humanity that is barely decent it is deliciously funny and always amuses menevertheless among my many faults the biggest one is i fancy pride and a dreadfully obstinate spirit of independence now to tell you the truth i have been asked by many socalled great people to their houses and when i have gone i have generally been sorry for it afterwards why i askedthey honour themselves by inviting you oh i dont think they take it in that way at all she replied shaking her fair head demurelythey fancy they have performed a great act of condescensionwhereas it is really i who condescend for it is very good of me you know to leave the society of the pallas athene in my study for that of a flounced and frizzled lady of fashion her bright smile again irradiated her face and she went ononce i was asked to luncheon with a certain baron and baroness who invited a few guests to meet me so they said i was not introduced to more than one or two of these peoplethe rest sat and stared at me as if i were a new kind of fish or fowl then the baron showed me his house and told me the prices of his pictures and his chinahe was even good enough to explain which was dresden and which was delft ware though i believe benighted author as i am i could have instructed him equally on these and other matters however i managed to smile amicably through the whole programme and professed myself charmed and delighted in the usual waybut they never asked me to visit them againand unless indeed they wanted me to be impressed with their furniturecatalogue i can never make out what i did to be asked at all and what i have done never to be asked any more they must have been parvenussaid sibyl indignantlyno wellbred people would have priced their goods to you unless they happened to be jews mavis laugheda merry little laugh like a peal of bellsthen she continued well i will not say who they werei must keep something for my literary reminiscences when i get old then all these people will be named and go down to posterity as dantes enemies went down to dantes hell i have only told you the incident just to show you why i asked you if you meant it when you invited me to visit you at willowsmere because the baron and baroness i have spoken of gushed over me and my poor books to such an extent that you would have fancied i was to be for evermore one of their dearest friendsand they didnt mean it other people i know embrace me effusively and invite </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> invite me to their houses and they dont mean it and when i find out these shams i like to make it very clear on my own side that i do not seek to be embraced or invited and that if certain great folks deem it a favour to ask me to their houses i do not so consider it but rather think the favour is entirely on my part if i accept the invitation and i do not say this for my own self at allself has nothing to do with itbut i do say it and strongly assert it for the sake of the dignity of literature as an art and profession if a few other authors would maintain this position we might raise the standard of letters by degrees to what it was in the old days of scott and byron i hope you do not think me too proud on the contrary i think you are quite rightsaid sibyl earnestlyand i admire you for your courage and independence some of the aristocracy are i know such utter snobs that often i feel ashamed to belong to them but as far as we are concerned i can only assure you that if you will honour us by becoming our friend as well as neighbour you shall not regret it do try and like me if you can she bent forward with a witching smile on her fair face mavis looked at her seriously and admiringly how beautiful you are she said franklyeverybody tells you this of coursestill i cannot help joining in the general chorus to me a lovely face is like a lovely floweri must admire it beauty is quite a divine thing and though i am often told that the plain people are always the good people i never can quite believe it nature is surely bound to give a beautiful face to a beautiful spirit sibyl who had smiled with pleasure at the first words of the open compliment paid her by one of the most gifted of her own sex now flushed deeply not always miss clareshe said veiling her brilliant eyes beneath the droop of her long lashesone can imagine a fair fiend as easily as a fair angel true and mavis looked at her musinglythen suddenly laughing in her blithe bright way she addedquite true really i cannot picture an ugly fiendfor the fiends are supposed to be immortal and i am convinced that immortal ugliness has no part in the universe downright hideousness belongs to humanity aloneand an ugly face is such a blot on creation that we can only console ourselves by the reflection that it is fortunately perishable and that in course of time the soul behind it will be released from its illformed husk and will be allowed to wear a fairer aspect yes lady sibyl i will come to willowsmere i cannot refuse to look upon such loveliness as yours as often as i may you are a charming flatterer said sibyl rising and putting an arm round her in that affectionate coaxing way of hers which seemed so sincere and which so frequently meant nothingbut i confess i prefer to be flattered by a woman rather than by a man men say the same things to all womenthey have a very limited rpertoire of complimentsand they will tell a fright she is beautiful if it happens to serve their immediate purpose but women themselves can so hardly be persuaded to admit that any good qualities exist either inwardly or outwardly in one another that when they do say a kind or generous thing of their own sex it is a wonder worth remembering may i your study mavis willingly assentedand we all three went into the peaceful sanctum where the marble pallas presided and where the dogs tricksy and emperor were both ensconcedemperor sitting up on his haunches and surveying the prospect from the window and tricksy with a most absurd air of importance imitating the larger animals attitude precisely at a little distance off both creatures were friendly to my wife and to me and while sibyl was stroking the st bernards massive head mavis said suddenly where is the friend who came with you here first prince rimnez he is in st petersburg just nowi answeredbut we expect him in two or three weeks to stay with us on a visit for some time he is surely a very singular mansaid mavis thoughtfullydo you remember how strangely my dogs behaved to him emperor was quite restless and troublesome for two or three hours after he had gone and in a few words she told sibyl the incident of the st bernards attack upon lucio some people have a natural antipathy to dogssaid sibyl as she heardand the dogs always find it out and resent it but i should not have thought prince rimnez had an antipathy to any creatures exceptwomen and she laughed a trifle bitterly except women echoed mavis surprisedlydoes he hate women he must be a very good actor thenfor to me he was wonderfully kind and gentle sibyl looked at her intently and was silent for a minute then she said perhaps it is because he knows you are unlike the ordinary run of women and have nothing in common with their usual trumpery aims of course he is always courteous to our sexbut i think it is easy to see that his courtesy is often worn as a mere mask to cover a very different feeling you have perceived that then sibyl i said with a slight smile i should be blind if i had not perceived itshe replied i do not however blame him for his pet aversioni think it makes him all the more attractive and interesting he is a great friend of yours inquired mavis looking at me as she put the question the very greatest friend i havei replied quicklyi owe him more than i can ever repayindeed i have to thank him even for introducing me to my wife i said the words unthinkingly and playfully but as i uttered them a sudden shock affected my nervesa shock of painful memory yes it was truei owed to him to lucio the misery fear degradation and shame of having such a woman as sibyl was united to me till death should us part i felt myself turning sick and giddyand i sat down in one of the quaint oak chairs that helped to furnish mavis clares study allowing the two women to pass out of the open french window into the sunlit garden together the dogs following at their heels i watched them as they wentmy wife tall and stately attired in the newest and most fashionable modemavis small and slight with her soft white gown and floating waistribbonthe one sensual the other spiritualthe one base and vicious in desirethe other puresouled and aspiring to noblest endsthe one a physically magnificent animalthe other merely sweetfaced and ideally fair like a sylph of the woodlandsand looking i clenched my hands as i thought with bitterness of spirit what a mistaken choice i had made in the profound egotism which had always been part of my nature i now actually allowed myself to believe that i might had i chosen have wedded mavis clarenever for one moment imagining that all my wealth would have been useless to me in such a quest and that i might as well have proposed to pluck a star from the sky as to win a woman who was able to read my nature thoroughly and who would never have come down to my moneylevel from her intellectual throneno not though i had been a monarch of many nations i stared at the large tranquil features of the pallas atheneand the blank eyeballs of the marble goddess appeared to regard me in turn with impassive scorn i glanced round the room and at the walls adorned with the wise sayings of poets and philosopherssayings that reminded me of truths which i knew yet never accepted as practicable and presently my eyes were attracted to a corner near the writingdesk which i had not noticed before where there was a small dim lamp burning above this lamp an ivory crucifix gleamed white against draperies of dark purple velvetbelow it on a silver bracket was an hourglass through which the sand was running in glistening grains and round the entire little shrine was written in letters of gold now is the acceptable timethe word now being in larger characters than the rest now was evidently maviss mottoto lose no moment but to work to pray to love to hope to thank god and be glad for life all in the nowand neither to regret the past nor forebode the future but simply do the best that could be done and leave all else in childlike confidence to the divine will i got up restlesslythe sight of the crucifix curiously annoyed meand i followed the path my wife and mavis had taken through the garden i found them looking in at the cage of the athenum owlsthe owlinchief being as usual puffed out with his own importance and swelling visibly with indignation and excess of feather sibyl turned as she saw meher face was bright and smiling miss clare has very strong opinions of her own </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> own geoffrey she saidshe is not as much captivated by prince rimnez as most people arein fact she has just confided to me that she does not quite like him mavis blushed but her eyes met mine with fearless candour it is wrong to say what one thinks i know she murmured in somewhat troubled accentsand it is a dreadful fault of mine please forgive me mr tempest you tell me the prince is your greatest friendand i assure you i was immensely impressed by his appearance when i first saw him but afterwards after i had studied him a little the conviction was borne in upon me that he was not altogether what he seemed that is exactly what he says of himselfi answered laughing a littlehe has a mystery i believeand he has promised to clear it up for me some day but im sorry you dont like him miss clarefor he likes you perhaps when i meet him again my ideas may be differentsaid mavis gentlyat present welldo not let us talk of it any moreindeed i feel i have been very rude to express any opinion at all concerning one for whom you and lady sibyl have so great a regard but somehow i seemed impelled almost against my will to say what i did just now her soft eyes looked pained and puzzled and to relieve her and change the subject i asked if she was writing anything new oh yesshe repliedit would never do for me to be idle the public are very kind to meand no sooner have they read one thing of mine than they clamour for another so i am kept very busy and what of the critics i asked with a good deal of curiosity she laughed i never pay the least attention to them she answered except when they are hasty and misguided enough to write lies about methen i very naturally take the liberty to contradict those lies either through my own statement or that of my lawyers apart from refusing to allow the public to be led into a false notion of my work and aims i have no grudge whatever against the critics they are generally very poor hardworking men and have a frightful struggle to live i have often privately done some of them a good turn without their knowledge a publisher of mine sent me an ms the other day by one of my deadliest enemies on the press and stated that my opinion would decide its rejection or acceptancei read it through and though it was not very brilliant work it was good enough so i praised it as warmly as i could and urged its publication with the stipulation that the author should never be told i had had the casting vote it has just come out i seeand im sure i hope it will succeed here she paused to gather a few deep damask roses which she handed to sibyl yescritics are very badly even cruelly paidshe went on musinglyit is not to be expected that they should write eulogies of the successful author while they continue unsuccessfulsuch work could not be anything but gall and wormwood to them i know the poor little wife of one of themand settled her dressmakers bill for her because she was afraid to show it to her husband the very week afterwards he slashed away at my last book in the most approved style in the paper on which he is employed and got i suppose about a guinea for his trouble of course he didnt know about his little wife and her dunning dressmaker and he never will know because i have bound her over to secrecy but why do you do such things asked sibyl astonished i would have let his wife get into the county court for her bill if i had been you would you and mavis smiled gravelywell i could not you know who it was that said bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you besides the poor little woman was frightened to death at her own expenditure it is pitiful you know to see the helpless agonies of people who will live beyond their incomesthey suffer much more than the beggars in the street who make frequently more than a pound a day by merely whining and snivelling the critics are much more in evil case than the beggarsfew of them make even a pound a day and of course they regard as their natural enemies the authors who make thirty to fifty pounds a week i assure you i am very sorry for critics all roundthey are the leastregarded and worstrewarded of all the literary community and i never bother myself at all about what they say of me except as i before observed when in their haste they tell liesthen of course it becomes necessary for me to state the truth in simple selfdefence as well as by way of duty to my public but as a rule i hand over all my pressnotices to tricksy thereindicating the minute yorkshire terrier who followed closely at the edge of her white gownand he tears them to indistinguishable shreds in about three minutes she laughed merrily and sibyl smiled watching her with the same wonder and admiration that had been expressed in her looks more or less since the beginning of our interview with this lighthearted possessor of literary fame we were now walking towards the gate preparatory to taking our departure may i come and talk to you sometimes my wife said suddenly in her prettiest and most pleading voiceit would be such a privilege you can come whenever you like in the afternoonsreplied mavis readilythe mornings belong to a goddess more dominant even than beautywork you never work at night i asked indeed no i never turn the ordinances of nature upside down as i am sure i should get the worst of it if i made such an attempt the night is for sleepand i use it thankfully for that blessed purpose some authors can only write at night though i said then you may be sure they only produce blurred pictures and indistinct characterization said mavissome i know there are who invite inspiration through gin or opium as well as through the midnight influences but i do not believe in such methods morning and a freshly rested brain are required for literary labourthat is if one wants to write a book that will last for more than one season she accompanied us to the gate and stood under the porch her big dog beside her and the roses waving high over her head at any rate work agrees with yousaid sibyl fixing upon her a long intent almost envious gazeyou look perfectly happy i am perfectly happyshe answered smilingi have nothing in all the world to wish for except that i may die as peacefully as i have lived may that day be far distant i said earnestly she raised her soft meditative eyes to mine thank you she responded gentlybut i do not mind when it comes so long as it finds me ready she waved her hand to us as we left her and turned the corner of the laneand for some minutes we walked on slowly in absolute silence then at last sibyl spoke i quite understand the hatred there is in some quarters for mavis clareshe saidi am afraid i begin to hate her myself i stopped and stared at her astonished and confounded you begin to hate heryouand why are you so blind that you cannot perceive why she retorted the little malign smile i knew so well playing round her lipsbecause she is happy because she has no scandals in her life and because she dares to be content one longs to make her miserable but how to do it she believes in a godshe thinks all he ordains is right and good with such a firm faith as that she would be happy in a garret earning but a few pence a day i see now perfectly how she has won her publicit is by the absolute conviction she has herself of the theories of life she tries to instil what can be done against her nothing but i understand why the critics would like to quash herif i were a critic fond of whiskeyandsoda and musichall women i should like to quash her myself for being so different to the rest of her sex what an incomprehensible woman you are sibyl i exclaimed with real irritationyou admire miss clares booksyou have always admired themyou have asked her to become your friendand almost in the same breath you aver you would like to quash her or to make her miserable i confess i cannot understand you of course you cannot she responded tranquilly her eyes resting upon me with a curious expression as we paused for an instant under the deep shade of a chestnut tree before entering our own groundsi never supposed you could and unlike the ordinary femme incomprise i have never blamed you for your want of comprehension it has taken me some time to understand myself and even now i am not quite sure that i have gauged the depths or shallownesses of my own nature correctly but </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> but on this matter of mavis clare can you not imagine that badness may hate goodness that the confirmed drunkard may hate the sober citizen that the outcast may hate the innocent maiden and that it is possible that ireading life as i do and finding it loathsome in many of its aspectsdistrusting men and women utterlyand being destitute of any faith in godmay hateyes hateand she clenched her hand on a tuft of drooping leaves and scattered the green fragments at her feeta woman who finds life beautiful and god existentwho takes no part in our social shams and slandersand who in place of my selftorturing spirit of analysis has secured an enviable fame and the honour of thousands allied to a serene content why it would be something worth living for to make such a woman wretched for once in her lifebut as she is constituted it is impossible to do it she turned from me and walked slowly onwardi following in a pained silence if you do not mean to be her friend you should tell her soi said presentlyyou heard what she said about pretended protestations of regard i heardshe replied moroselyshe is a clever woman geoffrey and you may trust her to find me out without any explanation as she said this i raised my eyes and looked full at herher exceeding beauty was becoming almost an agony to my sight and in a sudden fools paroxysm of despair i exclaimed o sibyl sibyl why were you made as you are ah why indeed she rejoined with a faint mocking smileand why being made as i am was i born an earls daughter if i had been a drab of the street i should have been in my proper placeand novels would have been written about me and playsand i might have become such a heroine as should cause all good men to weep for joy because of my generosity in encouraging their vices but as an earls daughter respectably married to a millionaire am a mistake of nature yet nature does make mistakes sometimes geoffrey and when she does they are generally irremediable we had now reached our own grounds and i walked in miserable mood beside her across the lawn towards the house sibyli said at lasti had hoped you and mavis clare might be friends she laughed so we shall be friends i daresayfor a little whileshe repliedbut the dove does not willingly consort with the raven and mavis clares way of life and studious habits would be to me insufferably dull besides as i said before she as a clever woman and a thinker is too clearsighted not to find me out in the course of time but i will play humbug as long as i can if i perform the part of county lady or patron of course she wont stand me for a moment i shall have to assume a much more difficult rlethat of an honest woman again she laugheda cruel little laugh that chilled my blood and paced slowly into the house through the open windows of the drawingroom and i left alone in the garden among the nodding roses and waving trees felt that the beautiful domain of willowsmere had suddenly grown hideous and bereft of all its former charm and was nothing but a haunted house of desolationhaunted by an alldominant and ever victorious spirit of evil xxviii one of the strangest things in all the strange course of our human life is the suddenness of certain unlookedfor events which in a day or even an hour may work utter devastation where there has been more or less peace and hopeless ruin where there has been comparative safety like the shock of an earthquake the clamorous incidents thunder in on the regular routine of ordinary life crumbling down our hopes breaking our hearts and scattering our pleasures into the dust and ashes of despair and this kind of destructive trouble generally happens in the midst of apparent prosperity without the least warning and with all the abrupt fierceness of a desertstorm it is constantly made manifest to us in the unexpected and almost instantaneous downfall of certain members of society who have held their heads proudly above their compeers and have presumed to pose as examples of light and leading to the whole community we see it in the capricious fortunes of kings and statesmen who are in favour one day and disgraced the next and vast changes are wrought with such inexplicable quickness that it is scarcely wonderful to hear of certain religious sects who when everything is prospering more than usually well with them make haste to put on garments of sackcloth and cast ashes on their heads praying aloud prepare us o lord for the evil days which are at hand the moderation of the stoics who considered it impious either to rejoice or grieve and strove to maintain an equable middle course between the opposing elements of sorrow and joy without allowing themselves to be led away by overmuch delight or overmuch melancholy was surely a wise habit of temperament i who lived miserably as far as my inner and better consciousness was concerned was yet outwardly satisfied with the material things of life and the luxuries surrounding meand i began to take comfort in these things and with them endeavoured to quell and ignore my more subtle griefs succeeding so far in that i became more and more of a thorough materialist every day loving bodily ease appetizing food costly wine and personal indulgence to a degree that robbed me gradually of even the desire for mental effort i taught myself moreover almost insensibly to accept and tolerate what i knew of the wanton side of my wifes charactertrue i respected her less than the turk respects the creature of his harembut like the turk i took a certain savage satisfaction in being the possessor of her beauty and with this feeling and the brute passion it engendered i was fain to be content so that for a short time at least the drowsy satisfaction of a wellfed wellmated animal was minei imagined that nothing short of a stupendous financial catastrophe to the country itself could exhaust my stock of cashand that therefore there was no necessity for me to exert myself in any particular branch of usefulness but simply to eat drink and be merry as solomon advised intellectual activity was paralysed in meto take up my pen and write and make another and higher bid for fame was an idea that now never entered my mind i spent my days in ordering about my servants and practising the petty pleasures of tyranny on gardeners and grooms and in generally giving myself airs of importance mingled with an assumption of toleration and benevolence for the benefit of all those in my employ i knew the proper thing to do well enoughi had not studied the ways of the overwealthy for nothingi was aware that the rich man never feels so thoroughly virtuous as when he has inquired after the health of his coachmans wife and has sent her a couple of pounds for the outfit of her newborn baby the much pratedof kindness of heart and generosity possessed by millionaires generally amounts to this kind of thingand when if idly strolling about my parklands i happened to meet the small child of my lodgekeeper and then and there bestowed sixpence upon it i almost felt as if i deserved a throne in heaven at the right hand of the almighty so great was my appreciation of my own goodnature sibyl however never affected this sort of countymagnate beneficence she did nothing at all among our poor neighboursthe clergyman of the district unfortunately happened to let slip one day a few words to the effect that there was no great want of anything among his parishioners owing to the continual kindness and attention of miss clareand sibyl never from that moment proffered any assistance now and then she took her graceful person into lily cottage and sat with its happy and studious occupant for an hourand occasionally the fair author herself came and dined with us or had afternoon tea under the branching elms on the lawnbut even i intense egotist as i was could see that mavis was scarcely herself on these occasions she was always charming and bright of courseindeed the only times in which i was able to partially forget myself and the absurdly increasing importance of my personality in my own esteem were when she with her sweet voice and animated manner brought her wide knowledge of books men and things to bear on the conversation thus raising it to a higher level than was ever reached by my wife or me yet i now and then noticed a certain vague constraint about herand her frank eyes had frequently a pained and questioning look of trouble when they rested for any length of time on the enchanting beauty of sibyls face and form i however paid little heed to these trifling matters my whole care being to lose myself more and more utterly in the enjoyment of purely physical ease and comfort without troubling myself as to what such selfabsorption might lead in the future to be completely without a conscience without a heart and without sentiment </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense3> sentiment was i perceived the best way to keep ones appetite and preserve ones healthto go about worrying over the troubles of other people or put ones self out to do any good in the world would involve such an expenditure of time and trouble as must inevitably spoil ones digestionand i saw that no millionaire or even moderately rich man cares to run the risk of injuring his digestion for the sake of performing a kindness to a poorer fellowcreature profiting by the examples presented to me everywhere in society i took care of my digestion and was particular about the way in which my meals were cooked and servedparticular too as to the fashion in which my wife dressed for those mealsfor it suited my supreme humour to see her beauty bedecked as suitably and richly as possible that i might have the satisfaction of considering her points with the same epicurean fastidiousness as i considered a dish of truffles or specially prepared game i never thought of the stern and absolute lawunto whom much is given even from him should much be requiredi was scarcely aware of it in factthe new testament was of all books in the world the most unfamiliar to me and while i wilfully deafened myself to the voice of consciencethat voice which ever and anon urged me in vain to a nobler existencethe clouds were gathering ready to burst above me with that terrific suddenness such as always seems to us who refuse to study the causes of our calamities as astonishing and startling as death itself for we are always more or less startled at death notwithstanding that it is the commonest occurrence known towards the middle of september my royal and distinguished houseparty arrived and stayed at willowsmere court for a week of course it is understood that whenever the prince of wales honours any private residence with a visit he selects if not all at any rate the greater part of those persons who are to be invited to meet him he did so in the present instance and i was placed in the odd position of having to entertain certain people whom i had never met before and who with the questionable taste frequently exhibited among the upper ten looked upon me merely as the man with the millions the caterer for their provisions and no moredirecting their chief attention to sibyl who was by virtue of her birth and associations one of their set and pushing me their host more or less into the background however the glory of entertaining royalty more than sufficed for my poor pride at that time and with less selfrespect than an honest cur i was content to be snubbed and harassed and worried a hundred times a day by one or the other of the great personages who wandered at will all over my house and grounds and accepted my lavish hospitality many people imagine that it must be an honour to entertain a select party of aristocrats but i on the contrary consider that it is not only a degradation to ones manlier and more independent instincts but also a bore these highlybred highlyconnected individuals are for the most part unintelligent and devoid of resources in their own mindsthey are not gifted as conversationalists or witsone gains no intellectual advantage from their societythey are simply dull folk with an exaggerated sense of their own importance who expect wherever they go to be amused without trouble to themselves out of all the visitors at willowsmere the only one whom it was really a pleasure to serve was the prince of wales himselfand amid the many personal irritations i had to suffer from others i found it a positive relief to render him any attention however slight because his manner was always marked by that tact and courtesy which are the best attributes of a true gentleman whether he be prince or peasant in his own affable way he went one afternoon to see mavis clare and came back in high goodhumour talking for some time of nothing but the author of differences and of the success she had achieved in literature i had asked mavis to join our party before the prince came as i felt pretty sure he would not have erased her name from the list of guests submitted to himbut she would not accept and begged me very earnestly not to press the point i like the princeshe had saidmost people like him who know himbut i do not always like those who surround himpardon me for my frankness the prince of wales is a social magnethe draws a number of persons after him who by dint of wealth if not intelligence can contrive to push into his set now i am not an advocate of pushmoreover i do not care to be seen with everybodythis is my sinful pride you will say or as our american cousins would put it my cussedness but i assure you mr tempest the best possession i have and one which i value a great deal more even than my literary success is my absolute independence and i would not have it thought even erroneously that i am anxious to mix with the crowd of sycophants and timeservers who are only too ready to take advantage of the princes goodnature and acting upon her determination she had remained more than ever secluded in her cottagenest of foliage and flowers during the progress of the weeks festivitiesthe result being as i have stated that the prince dropped in upon her quite casually one day accompanied by his equerry and probably for all i knew had the pleasure of seeing the dove reviewers fed and squabbling over their meal much as we had desired and expected the presence of rimnez at our gathering he did not appear he telegraphed his regrets from paris and followed the telegram by a characteristic letter which ran thus my dear tempest you are very kind to wish to include me your old friend in the party you have invited to meet his royal highness and i only hope you will not think me churlish for refusing to come i am sick to death of royaltiesi have known so many of them in the course of my existence that i begin to find their society monotonous their positions are all so exactly alike tooand moreover have always been alike from the days of solomon in all his glory down to the present blessed era of victoria queen and empress one thirsts for a change at least i do the only monarch that ever fascinated my imagination particularly was richard coeur de lion there was something original and striking about that man and i presume he would have been well worth talking to and charlemagne was doubtless as the slangy young man of the day would observe not half bad but for the restun fico much talk is there made about her majesty elizabeth who was a shrew and a vixen and bloodthirsty withalthe chief glory of her reign was shakespeare and he made kings and queens the dancing puppets of his thought in this though in nothing else i resemble him you will have enough to do in the entertainment of your distinguished guests for i suppose there is no amusement they have not tried and found more or less unsatisfactory and i am sorry i can suggest nothing particularly new for you to do her grace the duchess of rapidryder is very fond of being tossed in a strong tablecloth between four ablebodied gentlemen of good birth and discretion before going to bed o nightsshe cannot very well appear on a musichall stage you know owing to her exalted rankand this is a childlike pretty and harmless method of managing to show her legs which she rightly considers are too shapely to be hidden lady bouncer whose name i see in your list always likes to cheat at cardsi would aid and abet her in her aim if i were you as if she can only clear her dressmakers bill by her winnings at willowsmere she will bear it in mind and be a useful social friend to you the honourable miss fitzgander who has a great reputation for virtue is anxious for pressing and particular reasons to marry lord noodlesif you can move on matters between them into a definite engagement of marriage before her ladymother returns from her dutyvisits in scotland you will be doing her a good turn and saving society a scandal to amuse the men i suggest plenty of shooting gambling and unlimited smoking to entertain the prince do littlefor he is clever enough to entertain himself privately with the folly and humbug of those he sees around him without actually sharing in the petty comedy he is a keen observerand must derive infinite gratification from his constant study of men and manners which is sufficiently deep and searching to fit him for the occupation of even the throne of england i say even for at present till times great hourglass turns it is the grandest throne in the world the prince reads understands and secretly laughs to scorn the tablecloth vagaries of the duchess of rapidryder the humours of my lady bouncer and the nervous pruderies of the honourable miss fitzgander and there </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> there is nothing he will appreciate so much in his reception as a lack of toadyism a sincere demeanour an unostentatious hospitality a simplicity of speech and a total absence of affectation remember this and take my advice for what it is worth of all the royalties at present flourishing on this paltry planet i have the greatest respect for the prince of wales and it is by reason of this very respect that i do not intend on this occasion at any rate to thrust myself upon his notice i shall arrive at willowsmere when your royal festivities are over my homage to your fair spouse the lady sibyl and believe me yours as long as you desire it lucio rimnez i laughed over this letter and showed it to my wife who did not laugh she read it through with a closeness of attention that somewhat surprised me and when she laid it down there was a strange look of pain in her eyes how he despises us all she said slowlywhat scorn underlies his words do you not recognise it he was always a cynic i replied indifferentlyi never expect him to be anything else he seems to know some of the ways of the women who are coming here she went on in the same musing accents it is as if he read their thoughts and perceived their intentions at a distance her brows knitted frowningly and she seemed for some time absorbed in gloomy meditation but i did not pursue the subjecti was too intent on my own fussy preparations for the princes arrival to care about anything else and as i have said royalty in the person of one of the most genial of men came and went through the whole programme devised for his entertainment and then departed again with his usual courteous acknowledgments for the hospitality offered and acceptedleaving us as he generally leaves everybody charmed with his goodhumour and condescension provided his temper has not been ruffled when with his exit from the scene the whole party broke up leaving my wife and me to our own two selves once more there came a strange silence and desolation over the house that was like the stealthy sense of some approaching calamity sibyl seemed to feel it as much as i didand though we said nothing to each other concerning our mutual sensations i could see that she was under the same cloud of depression as myself she went oftener to lily cottage and always from these visits to the fairhaired student among the roses came back i hopefully fancied in softer moodher very voice was gentlerher eyes more thoughtful and tender one evening she said i have been thinking geoffrey that perhaps there is some good in life after all if i could only find it out and live it but you are the last person to help me in such a matter i was sitting in an armchair near the open window smoking and i turned my eyes upon her with some astonishment and a touch of indignation what do you mean sibyl i askedsurely you know that i have the greatest desire to see you always in your best aspectmany of your ideas have been most repugnant to me stop there she said quickly her eyes flashing as she spokemy ideas have been repugnant to you you say what have you done you as my husband to change those ideas have you not the same base passions as iand do you not give way to them as basely what have i seen in you from day to day that i should take you as an example you are master here and you rule with all the arrogance wealth can giveyou eat drink and sleepyou entertain your acquaintances simply that you may astonish them by the excess of luxury in which you indulgeyou read and smoke shoot and ride and there an endyou are an ordinary not an exceptional man do you trouble to ask what is wrong with medo you try with the patience of a great love to set before me nobler aims than those i have consciously or unconsciously imbibeddo you try to lead me an erring passionate misguided woman into what i dream of as the lightthe light of faith and hope which alone gives peace and suddenly burying her head in the pillows of the couch on which she leaned she broke into a fit of smothered weeping i drew my cigar from my mouth and stared at her helplessly it was about an hour after dinner and a warm soft autumnal eveningi had eaten and drunk well and i was drowsy and heavybrained dear me i murmuredyou seem very unreasonable sibyl i suppose you are hysterical she sprang up from the couchher tears dried on her cheeks as though by sheer heat of the crimson glow that flushed them and she laughed wildly yes that is it she exclaimedhysterianothing else it is accountable for everything that moves a womans nature a woman has no right to have any emotions that cannot be cured by smellingsalts heartachepoohcut her staylace despair and a sense of sin and miserynonsensebathe her temples with vinegar an uneasy conscienceahfor an uneasy conscience there is nothing better than sal volatile woman is a toya breakable fools toyand when she is broken throw her aside and have done with herdont try to piece together the fragile rubbish she ceased abruptly panting for breathand before i could collect my thoughts or find any words wherewith to reply a tall shadow suddenly darkened the embrasure of the window and a familiar voice enquired may i with the privilege of friendship enter unannounced i started up rimnez i cried seizing him by the hand nay geoffrey my homage is due here firsthe replied shaking off my grasp and advancing to sibyl who stood perfectly still where she had risen up in her strange passionlady sibyl am i welcome can you ask it she said with an enchanting smile and in a voice from which all harshness and excitement had fled more than welcome here she gave him both her hands which he respectfully kissed you cannot imagine how much i have longed to see you again i must apologise for my sudden appearance geoffreyhe then observed turning to mebut as i walked here from the station and came up your fine avenue of trees i was so struck with the loveliness of this place and the exquisite peace of its surroundings that knowing my way through the grounds i thought i would just look about and see if you were anywhere within sight before i presented myself at the conventional door of entrance and i was not disappointedi found you as i expected enjoying each others societythe happiest and most fortunate couple existentpeople whom out of all the world i should be disposed to envy if i envied worldly happiness at all which i do not i glanced at him quicklyhe met my gaze with a perfectly unembarrassed air and i concluded that he had not overheard sibyls sudden melodramatic outburst have you dined i asked with my hand on the bell thanks yes the town of leamington provided me with quite a sumptuous repast of bread and cheese and ale i am tired of luxuries you knowthat is why i find plain fare delicious you are looking wonderfully well geoffreyshall i offend you if i say you are growingyespositively stoutwith the stoutness befitting a true county gentleman who means to be as gouty in the future as his respectable ancestors i smiled but not altogether with pleasure it is never agreeable to be called stout in the presence of a beautiful woman to whom one has only been wedded a matter of three months you have not put on any extra flesh i said by way of feeble retort nohe admitted as he disposed his slim elegant figure in an armchair near my ownthe necessary quantity of flesh is a bore to me alwaysextra flesh would be a positive infliction i should like as the irreverent though reverend sidney smith said on a hot day to sit in my bones or rather to become a spirit of fine essence like shakespeares ariel if such things were possible and permissible how admirably married life agrees with you lady sibyl his fine eyes rested upon her with apparent admirationshe flushed under his gaze i saw and seemed confused when did you arrive in england she inquired yesterdayhe answeredi ran over channel from honfleur in my yachtyou did not know i had a yacht did you tempestoh you must come for a trip in her some day she is a quick vessel and the weather was fair is amiel with you i asked no i left him on board the yacht i can as the common people say valet myself for a day or two a day or two echoed sibylbut you surely will not leave us so soon you promised to make a long visit here did i and he regarded her steadily with the same languorous admiration in his eyesbut my dear lady sibyl time alters our ideas and i am not sure whether you and your excellent husband are of the same opinion as you were when you started on your weddingtour you may not </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> not want me now he said this with a significance to which i paid no heed whatever not want you i exclaimedi shall always want you lucioyou are the best friend i ever had and the only one i care to keep believe metheres my hand upon it he looked at me curiously for a minutethen turned his head towards my wife and what does lady sibyl say he asked in a gentle almost caressing tone lady sibyl says she answered with a smile and the colour coming and going in her cheeksthat she will be proud and glad if you will consider willowsmere your home as long as you have leisure to make it soand that she hopesthough you are reputed to be a hater of women here she raised her beautiful eyes and fixed them full upon himyou will relent a little in favour of your present chtelaine with these words and a playful salutation she passed out of the room into the garden and stood on the lawn at a little distance from us her white robes shimmering in the mellow autumnal twilightand lucio springing up from his seat looked after her clapping his hand down heavily on my shoulder by heaven he said softly a perfect woman i should be a churl to withstand heror you my good geoffreyand he regarded me earnestlyi have led a very devil of a life since i saw you lastits time i reformedupon my soul it is the peaceful contemplation of virtuous marriage will do me goodsend for my luggage to the station geoffrey and make the best of meive come to stay xxix a tranquil time now ensued a time which though i knew it not was just that singular pause so frequently observed in nature before a storm and in human life before a crushing calamity i put aside all troublesome and harassing thoughts and became oblivious of everything save my own personal satisfaction in the renewal of the comradeship between myself and lucio we walked together rode together and passed most of our days in each others companynevertheless though i gave my friend much of my closest confidence i never spoke to him of the moral obliquities and perversions i had discovered in sibyls characternot out of any consideration for sibyl but simply because i knew by instinct what his reply would be he would have no sympathy with my feelings his keen sense of sarcasm would overrule his friendship and he would retort upon me with the questionwhat business had i being imperfect myself to expect perfection in my wife like many others of my sex i had the notion that i as man could do all i pleased when i pleased and how i pleased i could sink to a level lower than that of the beasts if i chosebut all the same i had the right to demand from my wife the most flawless purity to mate with my defilement i was aware how lucio would treat this form of arrogant egoismand with what mocking laughter he would receive any expression of ideas from me on the subject of morality in woman so i was careful to let no hint of my actual position escape meand i comported myself on all occasions to sibyl with special tenderness and consideration though she i thought appeared rather to resent my playing the part of loverhusband too openly she was herself in lucios presence strangely erratic of humour by turns brilliant and mournfulsometimes merry and anon depressed yet never had she displayed a more captivating grace and charm of manner how foolish and blind i was all the whilehow dead to any perception of the formation and sequence of events absorbed in gross material pleasures i ignored all the hidden forces that make the history of an individual life no less than of a whole nation and looked upon each day that dawned almost as if it had been my own creation and possession to waste as i thought fitnever considering that days are but so many white leaflets from gods chronicle of human life whereon we place our mark good or bad for the just and exact summingup of our thoughts and deeds here after had any one dared to say this truth to me then i should have bade him go and preach nonsense to childrenbut nowwhen i recall those white leaves of days that were unrolled before me fresh and blank with every sunrise and with which i did nothing save scrawl my own ego in a foul smudge across each one i tremble and inwardly pray that i may never be forced to send back my selfwritten record yet of what use is it to pray against eternal law it is eternal law that we shall ourselves count up our own misdeeds at the final reckoninghence it is no wonder that many are found who prefer not to believe in a future after death rightly do such esteem it better to die utterly than be forced to live again and look back upon the wilful evil they have done october ripened slowly and almost imperceptibly towards its end and the trees put on their gorgeous autumnal tints of burning crimson and gold the weather remained fine and warm and what the french canadians poetically term the summer of all saints gave us bright days and cloudless moonlit evenings the air was so mild that we were always able to take our coffee after dinner on the terrace overlooking the lawn in front of the drawingroomand it was on one of these balmy nights that i was the interested spectator of a strange scene between lucio and mavis clarea scene i should have thought impossible of occurrence had i not myself witnessed it mavis had dined at willowsmere she very rarely so honoured us and there were a few other guests besides we had lingered over the coffee longer than usual for mavis had given an extra charm to the conversation by her eloquent vivacity and bright humour and all present were anxious to hear see and know as much of the brilliant novelist as possible but when a full golden moon rose in mellow splendour over the treetops my wife suggested a stroll in the grounds and everyone agreeing to the proposal with delight we startedmore or less togethersome in couples some in groups of three or four after a little desultory rambling however the party got separated in the rosegardens and adjacent shrubberies and i found myself alone i turned back to the house to get my cigarcase which i had left on a table in the library and passing out again in another direction i strolled slowly across the grass smoking as i went towards the river the silver gleam of which could clearly be discerned through the fastthinning foliage overhanging its banks i had almost reached the path that followed the course of the winding water when i was brought to a standstill by the sound of voicesone a mans low and persuasivethe other a womans tender grave and somewhat tremulous neither voice could be mistaken i recognized lucios rich penetrating tones and the sweet vibrante accents of mavis clare out of sheer surprise i pausedhad lucio fallen in love i wondered halfsmilingwas i about to discover that the supposed womanhater had been tamed and caught at last by mavis toolittle mavis who was not beautiful according to accepted standards but who had something more than beauty to enravish a proud and unbelieving soulhere as my thoughts ran on i was conscious of a foolish sense of jealousywhy should he choose mavis i thought out of all women in the world could he not leave her in peace with her dreams her books and her flowerssafe under the pure wise impassive gaze of pallas athene whose cool brows were never fevered by a touch of passion something more than curiosity now impelled me to listen and i cautiously advanced a step or two towards the shadow of a broad elm where i could see without being seen yes there was rimnezstanding erect with folded arms his dark sad inscrutable eyes fixed on mavis who stood opposite to him a few paces off looking at him in her turn with an expression of mingled fascination and fear i have asked you mavis claresaid lucio slowlyto let me serve you you have geniusa rare quality in a womanand i would advance your fortunes i should not be what i am if i did not try to persuade you to let me help on your career you are not richi could show you how to become so you have a great famethat i grant but you have many enemies and slanderers who are for ever trying to pull you down from the throne you have won i could bring these to your feet and make them your slaves with your intellectual power your personal grace and gifts of temperament i could if you would let me guide you give you such farreaching influence as no woman has possessed in this century i am no boasteri can do what i say and more and i ask nothing from you in return except that you should follow my advice implicitly my advice let me tell you is not difficult to follow most people find it easy </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> easy his expression of face i thought was very singular as he spokeit was so haggard dreary and woebegone that one might have imagined he was making some proposal that was particularly repugnant to him instead of offering to perform the benevolent action of helping a hardworking literary woman to achieve greater wealth and distinction i waited expectantly for mavis to reply you are very good prince rimnez she said after a little pauseto take any thought for me at all i cannot imagine why you should do so for i am really nothing to you i have of course heard from mr tempest of your great wealth and influence and i have no doubt you mean kindly but i have never owed anything to any oneno one has ever helped mei have helped myself and still prefer to do so and really i have nothing to wish forexceptwhen the time comesa happy death it is true i am not richbut then i do not want to be rich i would not be the possessor of wealth for all the world to be surrounded with sycophants and flatterersnever to be able to distinguish false friends from trueto be loved for what you have and not for what you areoh no it would be misery to me and i have never craved for powerexcept perhaps the power to win love and that i havemany people love my books and through my books love mei feel their love though i may never see or know them personally but i am so conscious of their sympathy that i love them in return without the necessity of personal acquaintance they have hearts which respond to my heartthat is all the power i care about you forget your numerous enemies said lucio still morosely regarding her no i do not forget themshe returnedbuti forgive them they can do me no harm as long as i do not lower myself no one else can lower me if my own conscience is clear no reproaches can wound my life is open to allpeople can see how i live and what i do i try to do wellbut if there are those who think i do ill i am sorryand if my faults can be amended i shall be glad to amend them one must have enemies in this worldthat is if one makes any sort of positionpeople without enemies are generally nonentities all who succeed in winning some little place of independence must expect the grudging enmity of hundreds who cannot find even the smallest foothold and are therefore failures in the battle of lifei pity these sincerely and when they say or write cruel things of me i know it is only spleen and disappointment that moves both their tongues and pens and freely pardon them they cannot hurt or hinder mein fact no one can hurt or hinder me but myself i heard the trees rustle slightlya branch crackedand peering through the leaves i saw that lucio had advanced a step closer to where mavis stood a faint smile was on his face softening it wonderfully and giving an almost supernatural light to his beautiful dark features fair philosopher you are almost a feminine marcus aurelius in your estimate of men and thingshe said butyou are still a womanand there is one thing lacking to your life of sublime and calm contentmenta thing at whose touch philosophy fails and wisdom withers at its root love mavis clarelovers lovedevoted love blindly passionatethis has not been yours as yet to win no heart beats against your ownno tender arms caress youyou are alone men are for the most part afraid of youbeing brute fools themselves they like their women to be brute fools alsoand they grudge you your keen intellectyour serene independence yet which is bestthe adoration of a brute fool or the loneliness pertaining to a spirit aloft on some snowy mountainpeak with no companions but the stars think of itthe years will pass and you must needs grow oldand with the years will come that solitary neglect which makes age bitter now you will doubtless wonder at my wordsyet believe me i speak the truth when i say that i can give you lovenot my love for i love nonebut i can bring to your feet the proudest men in any country of the world as suitors for your hand you shall have your choice of them and your own time for choosingand whomsoever you love him you shall wed whywhat is wrong with you that you shrink from me thus for she had retreated and was gazing at him in a kind of horror you terrify me she falteredand as the moonlight fell upon her i could see that she was very palesuch promises are incredibleimpossible you speak as if you were more than human i do not understand you prince rimnezyou are different to anyone i ever met and and something in me stronger than myself warns me against you what are youwhy do you talk to me so strangely pardon me if i seem ungrateful oh let us go init is getting quite late i am sure and i am cold she trembled violently and caught at the branch of a tree to steady herselfrimnez stood immovably still regarding her with a fixed and almost mournful gaze you say my life is lonelyshe went on reluctantly and with a note of pathos in her sweet voiceand you suggest love and marriage as the only joys that can make a woman happy you may be right i do not presume to assert that you are wrong i have many married womenfriendsbut i would not change my lot with any one of them i have dreamed of lovebut because i have not realized my dream i am not the less content if it is gods will that i should be alone all my days i shall not murmur for my solitude is not actual loneliness work is a good comradethen i have books and flowers and birdsi am never really lonely and that i shall fully realize my dream of love one day i am sureif not here then hereafter i can wait as she spoke she looked up to the placid heavens where one or two stars twinkled through the arching boughsher face expressed angelic confidence and perfect peaceand rimnez advancing a step or two fully confronted her with a strange light of exultation in his eyes trueyou can wait mavis clare he said in deep clear tones from which all sadness had fledyou can afford to wait tell methink for a momentcan you remember me is there a time on which you can look back and looking see my face not here but elsewhere think did you ever see me long agoin a far sphere of beauty and light when you were an angel mavisand i wasnot what i am now how you tremble you need not fear mei would not harm you for a thousand worlds i talk wildly at times i knowi think of things that are pastlong long pastand i am filled with regrets that burn my soul with fiercer heat than fire and so neither worlds wealth worlds power nor worlds love will tempt you mavisand youa woman you are a living miracle thenas miraculous as the drop of undefiled dew which reflects in its tiny circumference all the colours of the sky and sinks into the earth sweetly carrying moisture and refreshment where it falls i can do nothing for youyou will not have my aidyou reject my service then as i may not help you you must help meand dropping before her he reverently took her hand and kissed iti ask a very little thing of youpray for me i know you are accustomed to pray so it will be no trouble to youyou believe god hears youand when i look at you i believe it too only a pure woman can make faith possible to man pray for me then as one who has fallen from his higher and better selfwho strives but who may not attainwho labours under heavy punishmentwho would fain reach heaven but who by the cursd will of man and man alone is kept in hell pray for me mavis clare promise itand so shall you lift me a step nearer the glory i have lost i listened petrified with amazement could this be luciothe mocking careless cynical scoffer i knew as i thought so wellwas it really he who knelt thus like a repentant sinner abasing his proud head before a woman i saw mavis release her hand from his the while she stood looking down upon him in alarm and bewilderment presently she spoke in sweet yet tremulous accents since you desire it so earnestly i promiseshe saidi will pray that the strange and bitter sorrow which seems to consume you may be removed from your life sorrow he echoed interrupting her and springing to his feet with an impassioned gesturewomangeniusangel whatever you are do not speak of one sorrow for me i have a thousand thousand sorrowsaye a million million that are as little flames about my heart and as deeply seated as the centres of the universe the foul and filthy crimes of menthe base deceits and cruelties of womenthe ruthless murderous ingratitude of childrenthe scorn of good </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> good the martyrdom of intellect the selfishness the avarice the sensuality of human life the hideous blasphemy and sin of the creature to the creatorthese are my endless sorrowsthese keep me wretched and in chains when i would fain be free these create hell around me and endless torturethese bind and crush me and pervert my being till i become what i dare not name to myself or to others and yet as the eternal god is my witness i do not think i am as bad as the worst man living i may temptbut i do not pursuei take the lead in many lives yet i make the way i go so plain that those who follow me do so by their own choice and free will more than by my persuasion he pausedthen continued in a softer toneyou look afraid of mebut be assured you never had less cause for terror you have truth and purityi honour both you will have none of my advice or assistance in the making of your lifes historytonight therefore we part to meet no more on earth never again mavis clareno not through all your quiet days of sweet and contented existence will i cross your pathbefore heaven i swear it but why asked mavis gently approaching him now as she spoke with a soft grace of movement and laying her hand on his armwhy do you speak with such a passion of selfreproach what dark cloud is on your mind surely you have a noble natureand i feel that i have wronged you in my thoughts you must forgive mei have mistrusted you you do well to mistrust me he answered and with these words he caught both her hands and held them in his own looking at her full in the face with eyes that flashed like jewels your instinct teaches you rightly would there were many more like you to doubt me and repel me one wordif when i am gone you ever think of me think that i am more to be pitied than the veriest paralysed and starving wretch that ever crawled on earthfor he perchance has hopeand i have none and when you pray for mefor i hold you to this promisepray for one who dares not pray for himself you know the words lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil tonight you have been led into temptation though you knew it not but you have delivered yourself from evil as only a true soul can and now farewell in life i shall see you no morein deathwell i have attended many deathbeds in response to the invitations of the moribundbut i shall not be present at yours perhaps when your parting spirit is on the verge between darkness and light you may know who i was and amand you may thank god with your last breath that we parted tonightas we do nowforever he loosened his grasp of hershe fell back from him pale and terrifiedfor there was something now in the dark beauty of his face that was unnatural and appalling a sombre shadow clouded his browshis eyes had gleams in them as of fireand a smile was on his lips half tender half cruel his strange expression moved even me to a sense of fear and i shivered with sudden cold though the air was warm and balmy slowly retreating mavis moved away looking round at him now and then as she went in wistful wonder and alarmtill in a minute or two her slight figure in its shimmering silken white robe had vanished among the trees i lingered hesitating and uncertain what to dothen finally determining to get back to the house if possible without being noticed i made one step when lucios voice scarcely raised addressed me well eavesdropper why did you not come out of the shadow of that elmtree and see the play to a better advantage surprised and confused i advanced mumbling some unintelligible excuse you saw a pretty bit of acting here he went on striking a match and lighting a cigar the while he regarded me coolly his eyes twinkling with their usual mockeryyou know my theory that all men and all women are purchaseable for gold well i wanted to try mavis clare she rejected all my advantageous offers as you must have heard and i could only make matters smooth by asking her to pray for me that i did this very melodramatically i hope you will admit a woman of that dreamy idealistic temperament always likes to imagine that there is a man who is grateful for her prayers you seemed very much in earnest about it i said vexed with myself that he had caught me spying why of course he responded thrusting his arm familiarly through minei had an audience two fastidious critics of dramatic art heard me rant my rantingsi had to do my best two critics i repeated perplexedly yes you on one sidelady sibyl on the other lady sibyl rose after the custom of fashionable beauties at the opera before the last scene in order to get home in good time for supper he laughed wildly and discordantly and i felt desperately uncomfortable you must be mistaken lucio i saidthat i listened i admitand it was wrong of me to do sobut my wife would never condescend ah then it must have been a sylph of the woods that glided out of the shadow with a silken train behind her and diamonds in her hair he retorted gailytut geoffreydont look so crestfallen i have done with mavis clare and she with me i have not been making love to heri have simply just to amuse myself tested her characterand i find it stronger than i thought the combat is over she will never go my waynor i fear shall i ever go hers upon my word lucio i said with some irritationyour disposition seems to grow more and more erratic and singular every day does it not he answered with a droll affectation of interested surprise in himselfi am a curious creature altogether wealth is mine and i care not a jot for itpower is mine and i loathe its responsibilityin fact i would rather be anything but what i am look at the lights of your home sweet home geoffrey this he said as we emerged from among the trees on to the moonlit lawn from whence could be seen the shining of the electric lamps in the drawingroomlady sibyl is therean enchanting and perfect woman who lives but to welcome you to her embracing arms fortunate manwho would not envy you lovewho would who could exist without itsave me who in europe at least would forego the delights of kissingwhich the japanese bytheby consider a disgusting habitwithout embracesand all those other endearments which are supposed to dignify the progress of true love one never tires of these thingsthere is no satiety i wish i could love somebody so you can if you likei said with a little uneasy laugh i cannot it is not in me you heard me tell mavis clare as much i have it in my power to make other people fall in love somewhat after the dexterous fashion practised by matchmaking mothersbut for myself love on this planet is too low a thingtoo brief in duration last night in a dreami have strange dreams at timesi saw one whom possibly i could lovebut she was a spirit with eyes more lustrous than the morning and a form as transparent as flameshe could sing sweetly and i watched her soaring upward and listened to her song it was a wild song and to many mortal ears meaninglessit was something like this and his rich baritone pealed lusciously forth in melodious tune into the light into the heart of the fire to the innermost core of the deathless flame i ascendi aspire under me rolls the whirling earth with the noise of a myriad wheels that run ever round and about the sun over me circles the splendid heaven strewn with the stars of morn and even and i a queen of the air serene float with my flaglike wings unfurled alonealonetwixt god and the world here he broke off with a laugh she was a strange spirithe saidbecause she could see nothing but herself twixt god and the world she was evidently quite unaware of the numerous existing barriers put up by mankind between themselves and their maker i wonder what unenlightened sphere she came from i looked at him in mingled wonder and impatience you talk wildlyi saidand you sing wildly of things that mean nothing and are nothing he smiled lifting his eyes to the moon now shining her fullest and brightest true he repliedthings which have meaning and are valuable have all to do with money or appetite geoffrey there is no wider outlook evidently but we were speaking of love and i hold that love should be eternal as hate here you have the substance of my religious creed if i have anythat there are two spiritual forces ruling the universelove and hateand that their incessant quarrel creates the general confusion of life both contend one against the otherand only at judgmentday will it be proved which is the strongest i am on the side of hate </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> hate myselffor at present hate has scored all the victories worth winning while love has been so often martyred that there is only the poor ghost of it left on earth at that moment my wifes figure appeared at the drawingroom window and lucio threw away his halfsmoked cigar your guardianangel beckons he said looking at me an odd expression of something like pity mingled with disdainlet us go in xxx the very next night but one after lucios strange interview with mavis clare the thunderbolt destined to wreck my life and humiliate me to the dust fell with appalling suddenness no warning givenit came at a moment when i had dared to deem myself happy all that daythe last day i was ever to know of pride or selfgratulationi had enjoyed life to the full it was a day too in which sibyl had seemed transformed to a sweeter gentler woman than i had hitherto known herwhen all her attractions of beauty and manner were apparently put forth to captivate and enthrall me as though she were yet to be wooed and won ordid she mean to bewitch and subjugate lucio of this i never thoughtnever dreamedi only saw in my wife an enchantress of the most voluptuous and delicate lovelinessa woman whose very garments seemed to cling to her tenderly as though proud of clothing so exquisite a forma creature whose every glance was brilliant whose every smile was a ravishmentand whose voice attuned to the softest and most caressing tones appeared in its every utterance to assure me of a deeper and more lasting love than i had yet enjoyed the hours flew by on golden wingswe all threesibyl myself and luciohad attained as i imagined to a perfect unity of friendship and mutual understandingwe had passed that last day together in the outlying woods of willowsmere under a gorgeous canopy of autumn leaves through which the sun shed mellow beams of rose and goldwe had had an al fresco luncheon in the open airlucio had sung for us wild old ballads and lovemadrigals till the very foliage had seemed to tremble with joy at the sound of such entrancing melodyand not a cloud had marred the perfect peace and pleasure of the time mavis clare was not with usand i was glad somehow i felt that of late she had been more or less a discordant element whenever she had joined our party i admired herin a sort of fraternal halfpatronizing way i even loved hernevertheless i was conscious that her ways were not as our waysher thoughts not as our thoughts i placed the fault on her of course i concluded that it was because she had what i elected to call literary egoism instead of by its rightful name the spirit of honourable independence i never considered the inflated quality of my own egoismthe poor pride of a cash and county position which is the pettiest sort of vainglory anyone can indulge inand after turning the matter over in my mind i decided that mavis was a very charming young woman with great literary gifts and an amazing pride which made it totally impossible for her to associate with many great people socalledas she would never descend to the necessary level of flunkeyish servility which they expected and which i certainly demanded i should almost have been inclined to relegate her to grub street had not a faint sense of justice as well as shame held me back from doing her that indignity even in my thoughts however i was too much impressed with my own vast resources of unlimited wealth to realize the fact that anyone who like mavis earns independence by intellectual work and worth alone is entitled to feel a far greater pride than those who by mere chance of birth or heritage become the possessors of millions then again mavis clares literary position was though i liked her personally always a kind of reproach to me when i thought of my own abortive efforts to win the laurels of fame so that on the whole i was glad she did not spend that day with us in the woodsof course if i had paid any attention to the trifles which make up the sum of life i should have remembered that lucio had told her he would meet her no more on earthbut i judged this to be a mere trifle of hasty and melodramatic speech without any intentional meaning so my last twentyfour hours of happiness passed away in halcyon serenityi felt a sense of deepening pleasure in existence and i began to believe that the future had brighter things in store for me than i had lately ventured to expect sibyls new phase of gentleness and tenderness towards me combined with her rare beauty seemed to augur that the misunderstandings between us would be of short duration and that her nature too early rendered harsh and cynical by a society education would soften in time to that beautiful womanliness which is after all womans best charm thus i thought in blissful and contented reverie reclining under the branching autumnal foliage with my fair wife beside me and listening to the rich tones of my friend lucios magnificent voice pealing forth sonorous wild melodies as the sunset deepened in the sky and the twilight shadows fell then came the nightthe night which dropped only for a few hours over the quiet landscape but for ever over me we had dined late and pleasantly fatigued with our day in the open air had retired early i had latterly grown a heavy sleeper and i suppose i must have slumbered some hours when i was awakened suddenly as though by an imperative touch from some unseen hand i started up in my bedthe nightlamp was burning dimly and by its glimmer i saw that sibyl was no longer at my side my heart gave one bound against my ribs and then almost stood stilla sense of something unexpected and calamitous chilled my blood i pushed aside the embroidered silken hangings of the bed and peered into the roomit was empty then i rose hastily put on my clothes and went to the doorit was carefully shut but not locked as it had been when we retired for the night i opened it without the least noise and looked out into the long passageno one there immediately opposite the bedroom door there was a winding oak staircase leading down to a broad corridor which in former times had been used as a musicroom or picturegalleryan ancient organ still sweet of tone occupied one end of it with dull golden pipes towering up to the carved and embossed ceilingthe other end was lit by a large oriel window like that of a church filled with rare old stained glass representing in various niches the lives of the saints the centre subject being the martyrdom of st stephen advancing with soft caution to the balustrade overlooking this gallery i gazed down into it and for a moment could see nothing on the polished floor but the crisscross patterns made by the moonlight falling through the great windowbut presently as i watched breathlessly wondering where sibyl could have gone to at this time of night i saw a dark tall shadow waver across the moonlit network of lines and i heard the smothered sound of voices with my pulses beating furiously and a sensation of suffocation in my throatfull of strange thoughts and suspicions which i dared not define i crept slowly and stealthily down the stair till as my foot touched the last step i sawwhat nearly struck me to the ground with a shock of agonyand i had to draw back and bite my lips hard to repress the cry that nearly escaped them therethere before me in the full moonlight with the colours of the red and blue robes of the painted saints on the window glowing bloodlike and azure about her knelt my wifearrayed in a diaphanous garment of filmy white which betrayed rather than concealed the outline of her formher wealth of hair falling about her in wild disorderher hands clasped in supplicationher pale face upturned and above her towered the dark imposing figure of lucio i stared at the twain with dry burning eyeswhat did this portend was shemy wifefalse was hemy frienda traitor patiencepatience i muttered to myselfthis is a piece of acting doubtlesssuch as chanced the other night with mavis clarepatiencelet us hear thisthis comedy and drawing myself close up against the wall i leaned there scarcely drawing breath waiting for her voicefor hiswhen they spoke i should knowyes i should know all and i fastened my looks on them as they stood therevaguely wondering even in my tense anguish at the fearful light on lucios facea light which could scarcely be the reflection of the moon as he backed the windowand at the scorn of his frowning brows what terrific humour swayed himwhy did he even to my stupefied thought appear more than humanwhy did his very beauty seem hideous at that moment and his aspect fiendish hushhush she spokemy wifei heard her every wordheard all and endured all without falling dead at her feet in the extremity of my dishonour and despair i love you she wailedlucio i love you and my love is killing me </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> me be mercifulhave pity on my passionlove me for one hour one little hourit is not much to ask and afterwardsdo with me what you willtorture me brand me an outcast in the public sight curse me before heaveni care nothingi am yours body and souli love you her accents vibrated with mad idolatrous pleadingi listened infuriated but dumb hushhush i told myself this is a comedynot yet played out and i waited with every nerve strained for lucios reply it came accompanied by a laugh low and sarcastic you flatter me he saidi regret i am unable to return the compliment my heart gave a throb of relief and fierce joyalmost i could have joined in his ironical laughter shesibyldragged herself nearer to him luciolucio she murmuredhave you a heart can you reject me when i pray to you thuswhen i offer you all myselfall that i am or ever hope to be am i so repugnant to you many men would give their lives if i would say to them what i say to youbut they are nothing to meyou alone are my worldthe breath of my existenceah lucio can you not believe will you not realize how deeply i love you he turned towards her with a sudden fierce movement that startled meand the cloud of scorn upon his brows grew darker i know you love me he said and from where i stood i saw the cold derisive smile flash from his lips to his eyes in lightninglike mockeryi have always known it your vampire soul leaped to mine at the first glance i ever gave youyou were a false foul thing from the first and you recognized your master yesyour master for she had uttered a faint cry as if in fearand he stooping snatched her two hands and grasped them hard in his ownlisten to the truth of yourself for once from one who is not afraid to speak ityou love meand truly your body and soul are mine to claim if i so choose you married with a lie upon your lips you swore fidelity to your husband before god with infidelity already in your thoughts and by your own act made the mystical blessing a blasphemy and a curse wonder not then that the curse has fallen i knew it allthe kiss i gave you on your weddingday put fire in your blood and sealed you minewhy you would have fled to me that very night had i demanded ithad i loved you as you love methat is if you choose to call the disease of vanity and desire that riots in your veins by such a name as love but now hear me and as he held her two wrists he looked down upon her with such black wrath depicted in his face as seemed to create a darkness round him where he stoodi hate you yesi hate you and all such women as you for you corrupt the worldyou turn good to evilyou deepen folly into crimewith the seduction of your nude limbs and lying eyes you make fools cowards and beasts of men when you die your bodies generate foulnessthings of the mould and slime are formed out of the flesh that was once fair for mans delightyou are no use in lifeyou become poison in deathi hate you all i read your soulit is an open book to meand it is branded with a name given to those who are publicly vile but which should of strict right and justice be equally bestowed on women of your position and type who occupy pride and place in this worlds standing and who have not the excuse of poverty for selling themselves to the devil he ceased abruptly and with passion making a movement as though to fling her from himbut she clung to his armclung with all the pertinacity of the loathly insect he had taken from the bosom of the dead egyptian woman and made a toy of to amuse his leisure and i looking on and listening honoured him for his plain speaking for his courage in telling this shameless creature what she was in the opinion of an honest man without glozing over her outrageous conduct for the sake of civility or social observance my friendmy more than friend he was truehe was loyalhe had neither desire nor intent to betray or dishonour me my heart swelled with gratitude to him and also with a curious sense of feeble selfpitycompassionating myself intensely i could have sobbed aloud in nervous fury and pain had not my desire to hear more repressed my personal excitement and emotion i watched my wife wonderinglywhat had become of her pride that she still knelt before the man who had taunted her with such words as should have been beyond all endurance lucio lucio she whispered and her whisper sounded through the long gallery like the hiss of a snakesay what you willsay all you will of meyou can say nothing that is not true i am vilei own it but is it of much avail to be virtuous what pleasure comes from goodnesswhat gratification from selfdenial there is no god to care a few years and we all die and are forgotten even by those who loved uswhy should we lose such joys as we may have for the mere asking surely it is not difficult to love even me for an houram i not fair to look uponand is all this beauty of my face and form worthless in your sight and you no more than man murder me as you may with all the cruelty of cruel words i care nothingi love youlove youand in a perfect passion of selfabandonment she sprang to her feet tossing back her rich hair over her shoulders and stood erect a very bacchante of wild lovelinesslook at me you shall notyou dare not spurn such a love as mine dead silence followed her outburstand i stared in fascinated awe at lucio as he turned more fully round and confronted her the expression of his countenance struck me then as quite unearthlyhis beautiful broad brows were knitted in a darkling line of menacehis eyes literally blazed with scorn and yet he laugheda low laugh resonant with satire shall notdare not he echoed disdainfullywomans wordswomans rantingthe shriek of the outraged feminine animal who fails to attract as she thinks her chosen mate such a love as yourswhat is it degradation to whosoever shall accept itshame to whosoever shall rely upon it you make a boast of your beauty your mirror shows you a pleasing imagebut your mirror liesas admirably as you do you see within it not the reflection of yourself for that would cause you to recoil in horror you merely look upon your fleshly covering a garment of tissues shrinkable perishable and only fit to mingle with the dust from which it sprang your beauty i see none of iti see you and to me you are hideous and will remain hideous for ever i hate youi hate you with the bitterness of an immeasurable and unforgiving hatredfor you have done me a wrongyou have wrought an injury upon meyou have added another burden to the load of punishment i carry she made a forward movement with outstretched armshe repulsed her by a fierce gesture stand back he saidbe afraid of me as of an unknown terror o pitiless heavento think of itbut a night ago i was lifted a step nearer to my lost delightand now this woman drags me back and downand yet again i hear the barring of the gates of paradise o infinite torture o wicked souls of men and womenis there no touch of grace or thought of god left in youand will ye make my sorrows eternal he stood lifting his face to the light where it streamed through the oriel window and the moonbeams colouring themselves faintly roseate as they filtered through the painted garments of st stephen showed a great and terrible anguish in his eyes i heard him with amazement and awei could not imagine what he meant by his strange wordsand it was evident by her expression that my reckless and abandoned wife was equally mystified lucioshe murmuredlucio what is it what have i donei who would not wound you for the worldi who but seek your love lucio to repay it in full with such fond passion and tenderness as you have never known for this and this only i married geoffreyi chose your friend as husband because he was your friend o perfidious woman and because i saw his foolish egotismhis pride in himself and his richeshis blind confidence in me and in youi knew that i could after a time follow the fashion of many another woman in my set and choose my loverah my loveri had chosen him alreadyi have chosen you lucioyes though you hate me you cannot hinder me from loving youi shall love you till i die he turned his gaze upon her steadilythe gloom deepening on his brows and after you die he saidwill you love me then there was a stern derision in his tone which appeared to vaguely terrify her after death she stammered yesafter death he repeated sombrelythere is an afteras your mother knows a faint exclamation escaped hershe fixed her eyes upon </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> upon him affrightedly fair lady he went onyour mother was like yourself a voluptuary she like you made up her mind to follow the fashion as you put it as soon as her husbands blind or willing confidence was gained she chose not one lover but many you know her end in the written but miscomprehended laws of nature a diseased body is the natural expression of a diseased mindher face in her last days was the reflex of her soul you shudderthe thought of her hideousness is repellent to your selfconscious beauty yet the evil that was in her is also in youit festers in your blood slowly but surely and as you have no faith in god to cure the disease it will have its wayeven at the final moment when death clutches at your throat and stops your breathing the smile upon your frozen lips then will not be the smile of a saint believe me but of a sinner death is never deceived though life may be and afterwards i ask again will you love me do you think when you know who i am i was myself startled at his manner of putting this strange questioni saw her lift her hands beseechingly towards him and she seemed to tremble when i know who you are she repeated wonderinglydo i not know you are luciolucio rimnezmy lovemy lovewhose voice is my musicwhose beauty i adorewhose looks are my heaven and hell he interposed with a low laughcome here she went towards him eagerly yet falteringly he pointed to the groundi saw the rare blue diamond he always wore on his right hand flash like a flame in the moonrays since you love me so wellhe saidkneel down and worship me she dropped on her kneesand clasped her handsi strove to moveto speakbut some resistless force held me dumb and motionlessthe light from the stained glass window fell upon her face and showed its fairness illumined by a smile of perfect rapture with every pulse of my being i worship you she murmured passionatelymy kingmy god the cruel things you say but deepen my love for youyou can kill but you can never change me for one kiss of your lips i would diefor one embrace from you i would give my soul have you one to give he asked derisivelyis it not already disposed of you should make sure of that first stay where you are and let me look at you soa woman wearing a husbands name holding a husbands honour clothed in the very garments purchased with a husbands money and newly risen from a husbands side steals forth thus in the night seeking to disgrace him and pollute herself by the vulgarest unchastity and this is all that the culture and training of nineteenthcentury civilization can do for you myself i prefer the barbaric fashion of old times when rough savages fought for their women as they fought for their cattle treated them as cattle and kept them in their place never dreaming of endowing them with such strong virtues as truth and honour if women were pure and true then the lost happiness of the world might return to itbut the majority of them are like you liars ever pretending to be what they are not i may do what i choose with you you say torture you kill you brand you with the name of outcast in the public sight and curse you before heavenif i will only love youall this is melodramatic speech and i never cared for melodrama at any time i shall neither kill you brand you curse you nor love youi shall simplycall your husband i stirred from my hidingplacethen stopped she sprang to her feet in an insensate passion of anger and shame you dare not she pantedyou dare not so disgrace me disgrace you he echoed scornfullythat remark comes rather late seeing you have disgraced yourself but she was now fairly roused all the savagery and obstinacy of her nature was awakened and she stood like some beautiful wild animal at bay trembling from head to foot with the violence of her emotions you repulse meyou scorn me she muttered in hurried fierce accents that scarcely rose above an angry whisperyou make a mockery of my hearts anguish and despair but you shall suffer for it i am your matchnay your equal you shall not spurn me a second time you ask will i love you when i know who you areit is your pleasure to deal in mysteries but i have no mysteriesi am a woman who loves you with all the passion of a lifeand i will murder myself and you rather than live to know that i have prayed you for your love in vain do you think i came unpreparedno and she suddenly drew from her bosom a short steel dagger with a jewelled hilt a curio i recognized as one of the gifts to her on her marriage love me i sayor i will stab myself dead here at your feet and cry out to geoffrey that you have murdered me she raised the weapon alofti almost sprang forwardbut i drew back again quickly as i saw lucio seize the hand that held the dagger and drag it firmly downwhile wresting the weapon from her clutch he snapped it asunder and flung the pieces on the floor your place was the stage madam he saidyou should have been the chief female mime at some highclass theatre you would have adorned the boards drawn the mob had as many lovers stagey and private as you pleased been invited to act at windsor obtained a paymentjewel from the queen and written your name in her autograph album that should undoubtedly have been your great careeryou were born for itmade for it you would have been as brutesouled as you are nowbut that would not have matteredmimes are exempt from chastity in the action of breaking the dagger and in the intense bitterness of his speech he had thrust her back a few paces from him and she stood breathless and white with rage eyeing him in mingled passion and terror for a moment she was silentthen advancing slowly with the feline suppleness of movement which had given her a reputation for grace exceeding that of any woman in england she said in deliberately measured accents lucio rimnez i have borne your insults as i would bear my death at your hands because i love you you loathe me you sayyou repulse mei love you still you cannot cast me offi am yours you shall love me or i will dieone of the two take time for thoughti leave you tonighti give you all tomorrow to considerlove megive me yourselfbe my loverand i will play the comedy of social life as well as

what i say do you queried lucio coldlylet me congratulate you few women attain to such coherence i will put an end to this life of mine she went on paying no sort of heed to his wordsi cannot endure existence without your love lucio and a dreary pathos vibrated in her voicei hunger for the kisses of your lipsthe clasp of your arms do you knowdo you ever think of your own powerthe cruel terrible power of your eyes your speech your smilethe beauty which makes you more like an angel than a manand have you no pity do you think that ever a man was born like you he looked at her as she said this and a faint smile rested on his lipswhen you speak i hear musicwhen you sing it seems to me that i understand what the melodies of a poets heaven must besurely surely you know that your very looks are a snare to the warm weak soul of a woman lucio and emboldened by his silence she stole nearer to himmeet me tomorrow in the lane near the cottage of mavis clare he started as if he had been stungbut not a word escaped him i heard all you said to her the other night she continued advancing yet a step closer to his sidei followed youand i listened i was wellnigh mad with jealousyi thoughti

<highSuspense3> mist swam before my sight would lucio yield not hehe loosened her desperate hands from about his throat and forced her back holding her at arms length woman false and accursd he said

whom you have knelt in idolatrous worship and a low fierce laugh escaped himwhyrestrain your feverish desires fair fiendhave patiencewe shall meet ere long i could not bear the scene another moment and springing from my hidingplace i dragged my wife away from him and flung myself between them let me defend you lucio from the pertinacities of this wanton i cried with a wild burst of laughteran hour ago i thought she was my wifei find her nothing but a purchased chattel who seeks a change of masters xxxi for one instant we all three stood facing each otheri breathless and mad with furylucio calm and disdainfulmy wife staggering back from me halfswooning with fear in an access of black rage i rushed upon her and seized her in my arms i have heard you i saidi have seen you i have watched you kneel before my true friend my loyal comrade there and try your best to make him as vile as yourself i am that poor fool your husbandthat blind egoist whose confidence you sought to winand to betray i am the unhappy wretch whose surplus of worlds cash has bought for him in marriage a shameless courtezan you dare to talk of love you profane its very name good godwhat are such women as you made of you throw yourselves into our armsyou demand our careyou exact our respectyou tempt our sensesyou win our heartsand then you make fools of us all fools and worse than foolsyou make us men without feeling conscience faith or pity if we become criminals what wonder if we do things that shame our sex is it not because you set us the example godgod i who loved youyes loved you in spite of all that my marriage with you taught mei who would have died to save you from a shadow of suspicioni am the one out of all the world you choose to murder by your treachery i loosened my grasp of hershe recovered her selfpossession by an effort and looked at me straightly with cold unfeeling eyes what did you marry me for she demandedfor my sake or your own i was silenttoo choked with wrath and pain to speak all i could do was to hold out my hand to lucio who grasped it with a cordial and sympathetic pressure yet i fancied he smiled was it because you desired to make me happy out of pure love for me pursued sibylor because you wished to add dignity to your own position by wedding the daughter of an earl your motives were not unselfishyou chose me simply because i was the beauty of the day whom london men stared at and talked ofand because it gave you a certain prestige to have me for your wife in the same way as it gave you a footing with royalty to be the owner of the derbywinner i told you honestly what i was before our marriageit made no effect upon your vanity and egoism i never loved youi could not love you and i told you so you have heard so you say all that has passed between me and luciotherefore you know why i married you i state it boldly to your faceit was that i might have your intimate friend for my lover that you should pretend to be scandalized at this is absurd it is a common position of things in france and is becoming equally common in england morality has always been declared unnecessary for menit is becoming equally unnecessary for women i stared at her amazed at the glibness of her speech and the cool convincing manner in which she spoke after her recent access of passion and excitement you have only to read the new fictionshe went on a mocking smile lighting up her pale face and indeed all new literature generally to be assured that your ideas of domestic virtue are quite out of date both men and women are according to certain accepted writers of the day at equal liberty to love when they will and where they may polygamous purity is the new creed such love in fact so we are taught constitutes the only sacred union if you want to alter this movement and return to the oldfashioned types of the modest maiden and the immaculate matron you must sentence all the new writers of profitable pruriency to penal servitude for life and institute a government censorship of the modern press as matters stand your attitude of the outraged husband is not only ridiculousit is unfashionable i assure you i do not feel the slightest prick of conscience in saying i love lucioany woman might be proud of loving himhe however will not or cannot love mewe have had a scene and you have completed the dramatic effect by witnessing itthere is no more to be said or done in the affair i do not suppose you can divorce mebut if you can you mayi shall make no defence she turned as if to goi still stared dumbly at her finding no words to cope with her effronterywhen lucios voice attuned to a grave and soothing suavity interposed this is a very painful and distressing state of thingshe said and the strange halfcynical half contemptuous smile still rested on his lipsbut i must positively protest against the idea of divorce not only for her ladyships sake but my own i am entirely innocent in the matter innocent i exclaimed grasping him again by the hand you are nobility itself lucioas loyal a friend as ever man had i thank you for your couragefor the plain and honest manner in which you have spoken i heard all you said nothing was too strongnothing could be too strong to awaken this misguided woman to a sense of her outrageous conducther unfaithfulness pardon me he interrupted delicatelythe lady sibyl can scarcely be called unfaithful geoffrey she suffersfromlet us call it a little exaltation of nerves in thought she may be guilty of infidelity but society does not know thatand in act she is purepure as the newlydriven snowand as the newlydriven snow will society itself immaculate regard her his eyes glitteredi met his chill derisive glance you think as i do lucio i said hoarselyyou feel with me that a wifes unchaste thought is as vile as her unchaste act there is no excuseno palliative for such cruel and abominable ingratitude whyand my voice rose unconsciously as i turned fiercely again towards sibyldid i not free you and your family from the heavy pressure of poverty and debt have i grudged you anything are you not loaded with jewelshave you not greater luxuries and liberties than a queen and do you not owe me at least some duty i owe you nothing she responded boldlyi gave you what you paid formy beauty and my social position it was a fair bargain a dear and bitter one i cried maybe so but such as it was you struck itnot i you can end it when you pleasethe law the law will give you no freedom in such a caseinterposed lucio with a kind of satirical urbanitya judicial separation on the ground of incompatibility of temper might be possible certainlybut would not that be a pity her ladyship is unfortunate in her tastesthat is allshe selected me as her cavaliere servente and i refused the situationhence there is nothing for it but to forget this unpleasant incident and try to live on a better understanding for the future do you thinksaid my wife advancing with her proud head uplifted in scorn the while she pointed at medo you think i will live with him after what he has seen and heard tonight what do you take me for for a very charming woman of hasty impulses and unwise reasoningreplied lucio with an air of sarcastic gallantrylady sibyl you are illogicalmost of your sex are you can do no good by prolonging this scenea most unpleasant and trying one to us poor men you know how we hate scenes let me beg of you to retire your duty is to your husband pray heaven he may forget this midnight delirium of yours and set it down to some strange illness rather than to any evil intention for all answer she came towards him stretching out her arms in wild appeal lucio she criedlucio my love goodnightgoodbye i sprang between him and her advancing form before my </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> my very face i exclaimedo infamous woman have you no shame none she said with a wild smilei glory in my love for such a king of worth and beauty look at himand then look at yourself in the nearest mirror that reflects so poor and mean a picture of a man how even in your egoism could you deem it possible for a woman to love you when he was near stand out of the lightyou interpose a shadow between my god and me as she uttered these mad words her aspect was so strange and unearthly that out of sheer stupefied wonder i mechanically did as she bade me and stood aside she regarded me fixedly i may as well say goodbye to you alsoshe observedfor i shall never live with you again nor i with you i said fiercely nor i with younor i with you she repeated like a child saying a lessonof course notif i do not live with you you cannot live with me she laughed discordantly then turned her beseeching gaze once more upon luciogoodbye she said he looked at her with a curious fixity but returned no word in answer his eyes flashed coldly in the moonlight like sharp steel and he smiled she regarded him with such passionate intentness that it seemed as though she sought to draw his very soul into herself by the magnetism of her glancebut he stood unmoved a very statue of fine disdain and intellectual selfrepression my scarcely controlled fury broke out again at the sight of her dumb yearning and i gave vent to a shout of scornful laughter by heaven a veritable new venus and reluctant adonis i cried deliriouslya poet should be here to immortalize so touching a scene gogoand i motioned her away with a furious gesturego if you do not want me to murder you go with the proud consciousness that you have worked all the mischief and ruin that is most dear to the heart of a womanyou have spoilt a life and dishonoured a nameyou can do no moreyour feminine triumph is complete gowould to god i might never see your face againwould to god i had been spared the misery of having married you she paid no attention whatever to my words but kept her eyes fixed on lucio retreating slowly she seemed to feel rather than see her way to the winding stair and there turning she began to ascend half way up she pausedlooked back and fully confronted us once morewith a wild wicked rapture on her face she kissed her hands to lucio smiling like a spectral woman in a dreamthen she went onward and upward step by step till the last white fold of her robe had vanishedand we twomy friend and iwere alone facing one another we stood silentlyi met his sombre eyes and thought i read an infinite compassion in themthenwhile i yet looked upon him something seemed to clutch my throat and stop my breathinghis dark and beautiful countenance appeared to me to grow suddenly lurid as with firea coronal of flame seemed to tremble above his browsthe moonlight glistened bloodreda noise was in my ears of mingled thunder and music as though the silent organ at the end of the gallery were played by hands invisiblestruggling against these delusive sensations i involuntarily stretched out my hands lucio i gaspedlucio my friend i think i am dying my heart is broken as i spoke a great blackness closed over meand i fell senseless xxxii oh the blessedness of absolute unconsciousness it is enough to make one wish that death were indeed annihilation utter oblivioncomplete destructionsurely this would be a greater mercy to the erring soul of man than the terrible godsgift of immortalitythe dazzling impress of that divine image of the creator in which we are all made and which we can never obliterate from our beings i who have realized to the full the unalterable truth of eternal lifeeternal regeneration for each individual spirit in each individual human creaturelook upon the endless futures through which i am compelled to take my part with something more like horror than gratitude for i have wasted my time and thrown away priceless opportunitiesand though repentance may retrieve these the work of retrieval is long and bitter it is easier to lose a glory than to win it and if i could have died the death that positivists hope for at the very moment when i learned the full measure of my hearts desolation surely it would have been well but my temporary swoon was only too briefand when i recovered i found myself in lucios own apartment one of the largest and most sumptuously furnished of all the guestchambers at willowsmerethe windows were wide open and the floor was flooded with moonlight as i shuddered coldly back to life and consciousness i heard a tinkling sound of tune and opening my eyes wearily i saw lucio himself seated in the full radiance of the moon with a mandoline on his knee from which he was softly striking delicate impromptu melodies i was amazed at thisastounded that while i personally was overwhelmed with a weight of woe he should still be capable of amusing himself it is a common idea with us all that when we ourselves are put out no one else should dare to be merryin fact we expect nature itself to wear a miserable face if our own beloved ego is disturbed by any troublesuch is the extent of our ridiculous selfconsciousness i moved in my chair and half rose from itwhen lucio still thrumming the strings of his instrument piano pianissimo said keep still geoffrey youll be all right in a few minutes dont worry yourself worry myself i echoed bitterlywhy not say dont kill yourself because i see no necessity to offer you that advice at present he responded coollyand if there were necessity i doubt if i should give itbecause i consider it better to kill ones self than worry ones self however opinions differ i want you to take this matter lightly lightlytake my own dishonour and disgrace lightly i exclaimed almost leaping from my chairyou ask too much my good fellow i ask no more than is asked and expected of a hundred society husbands today consideryour wife has been led away from her soberer judgment and reasoning by an exalted and hysterical passion for me on account of my looksnot for myself at allbecause she really does not know meshe only sees me as i appear to be the love of handsome exterior personalities is a common delusion of the fair sexand passes in time like other womens diseases no actual dishonour or disgrace attaches to her or to younothing has been seen heard or done in public this being so i cant understand what you are making a fuss about the great object of social life you know is to hide all savage passions and domestic differences from the gaze of the vulgar crowd you can be as bad as you like in privateonly god seesand that does not matter his eyes had a mocking lustre in themtwanging his mandoline he sang under his breath if she be not fair for me what care i how fair she be that is the true spirit geoffreyhe went onit sounds flippant to you no doubt in your present tragic frame of mindbut it is the only way to treat women in marriage or out of it before the world and society your wife is like csars above suspicion only you and i we will leave god out have been the witnesses of her attack of hysteria hysteria you call it she loves you i said hotlyand she has always loved you she confessed itand you admitted that you always knew it i always knew she was hystericalyesif that is what you meanhe answeredthe majority of women have no real feelings no serious emotionsexcept onevanity they do not know what a great love meanstheir chief desire is for conquestand failing in this they run up the gamut of baffled passion to the pitch of frenetic hysteria which with some becomes chronic lady sibyl suffers in this way now listen to me i will go off to paris or moscow or berlin at onceafter what has happened of course i cannot stay hereand i give you my word i will not intrude myself into your domestic circle again in a few days you will tide over this rupture and learn the wisdom of supporting the differences that occur in matrimony with composure impossible i will not part with you i said vehementlynor will i live with her better the companionship of a true friend than that of a false wife he raised his eyebrows with a puzzled half humorous expressionthen shrugged his shoulders as one who gives up a difficult argument rising he put aside his mandoline and came over to me his tall imposing figure casting a gigantic shadow in the brilliant moonbeams upon my word you put me in a very awkward position geoffreywhat is to be done you can get a judicial separation if you like but i think it would be an unwise course of procedure after barely four months of marriage the world would be set talking at once really it is better to </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> to do anything than give the gossips a chance for floating scandal look heredont decide anything hastilycome up to town with me for a day and leave your wife alone to meditate upon her foolishness and its possible consequencesthen you will be better able to judge as to your future movements go to your room and sleep till morning sleep i repeated with a shudderin that room where she i broke off with a cry and looked at him imploringlyam i going mad i wonder my brain seems on fire if i could forget if i could forget lucioif you my loyal friend had been false to me i should have diedyour truth your honour have saved me he smiledan odd cynical little smile tuti make no boast of virtuehe rejoinedif the ladys beauty had been any temptation to me i might have yielded to her charmsin so doing i should have been no more than man as she herself suggested but perhaps i am more than manat anyrate bodily beauty in woman makes no sort of effect on me unless it is accompanied by beauty of soulthen it does make an effect and a very extraordinary one it provokes me to try how deep the beauty goeswhether it is impervious or vulnerable as i find it so i leave it i stared wearily at the moonlight patterns on the floor what am i to do i askedwhat would you advise come up to town with mehe repliedyou can leave a note for your wife explaining your absenceand at one of the clubs we will talk over the matter quietly and decide how best to avoid a social scandal meanwhile go to bed if you wont go back to your own room sleep in the spare one next to mine i rose mechanically and prepared to obey him he watched me furtively will you take a composing draught if i mix it for you he saidit is harmless and will give you a few hours sleep i would take poison from your hand i answered recklesslywhy dont you mix that for meand then then i should sleep indeedand forget this horrible night nounfortunately you would not forget he said going to his dressingcase and taking out a small white powder which he dissolved gradually in a glass of waterthat is the worst of what people call dying i must instruct you in a little science byandby to distract your thoughts the scientific part of deaththe business that goes on behind the scenes you knowwill interest you very muchit is highly instructive particularly that section of it which i am entitled to call the regeneration of atoms the braincells are atoms and within these are other atoms called memories curiously vital and marvellously prolific drink thisand he handed me the mixture he had preparedfor temporary purposes it is much better than deathbecause it does numb and paralyse the conscious atoms for a little while whereas death only liberates them to a larger and more obstinate vitality i was too selfabsorbed to heed or understand his words but i drank what he gave me submissively and returned the glasshe still watched me closely for about a minute then he opened the door of the apartment which adjoined his own throw yourself on that bed and close your eyeshe continued in somewhat peremptory accentstill morning breaks i give you a respite and he smiled strangelyboth from dreams and memories plunge into oblivion my friendbrief as it is and as it must ever be it is sweeteven to a millionaire the ironical tone of his voice vexed mei looked at him half reproachfully and saw his proud beautiful face pale as marble clearcut as a cameo soften as i met his eyesi felt he was sorry for me despite his love of satireand grasping his hand i pressed it fervently without offering any other reply then going into the next room as he bade me i lay down and falling asleep almost instantly i remembered no more xxxiii with the morning came full consciousness i realized bitterly all that had happened but i was no longer inclined to bemoan my fate my senses were stricken as it seemed too numb and rigid for any further outbreak of passion a hard callousness took the place of outraged feeling and though despair was in my heart my mind was made up to one stern resolvei would look upon sibyl no more never again should that fair face the deceitful mask of a false nature tempt my sight and move me to pity or forgivenessthat i determined leaving the room in which i had passed the night i went to my study and wrote the following letter sibyl after the degrading and disgraceful scene of last night you must be aware that any further intercourse between us is impossible prince rimnez and i are leaving for london we shall not return you can continue to reside at willowsmerethe house is yoursand the half of my fortune unconditionally settled upon you on our marriageday will enable you to keep up the fashions of your set and live with that luxury and extravagance you deem necessary to an aristocratic position i have decided to traveland i intend to make such arrangements as may prevent if possible our ever meeting againthough i shall of course do my best for my own sake to avoid any scandal to reproach you for your conduct would be useless you are lost to all sense of shame you have abased yourself in the humiliation of a guilty passion before a man who despises youwho in his own loyal and noble nature hates you for your infidelity and hypocrisyand i can find no pardon for the wrong you have thus done to me and the injury you have brought upon my name i leave you to the judgment of your own conscienceif you have onewhich is doubtful such women as you are seldom troubled with remorse it is not likely you will ever see me or the man to whom you have offered your undesired love againmake of your life what you can or will i am indifferent to your movements and for my own part shall endeavour as much as may be to forget that you exist your husband geoffrey tempest this letter folded and sealed i sent to my wife in her own apartments by her maidthe girl came back and said she had delivered it but that there was no answer her ladyship had a severe headache and meant to keep her room that morning i expressed just as much civil regret as a confidential maid would naturally expect from the newlywedded husband of her mistressand then giving instructions to my man morris to pack my portmanteau i partook of a hurried breakfast with lucio in more or less silence and constraint for the servants were in attendance and i did not wish them to suspect that anything was wrong for their benefit i gave out that my friend and i were called suddenly to town on urgent businessthat we might be absent a couple of days perhaps longerand that any special message or telegram could be sent on to me at arthurs club i was thankful when we at last got awaywhen the tall picturesque red gables of willowsmere vanished from my sightand when finally seated in a railway smokingcarriage reserved for our two selves we were able to watch the miles of distance gradually extending between us and the beautiful autumnal woods of poethaunted warwickshire for a long time we kept silence turning over and pretending to read the mornings paperstill presently flinging down the dull and wearisome times sheet i sighed heavily and leaning back closed my eyes i am truly very much distressed about all this said lucio then with extreme gentleness and suavityit seems to me that i am the adverse element in the affair if lady sibyl had never seen me why then i should never have seen her i responded bitterlyit was through you i met her first true and he eyed me thoughtfullyi am very unfortunately placedit is almost as if i were to blame though noone could be more innocent or wellintentioned than myself he smiledthen went on very gravelyi really should avoid scandalous gossip if i were youi do not speak of my own involuntary share in the disasterwhat people say of me is quite immaterial but for the ladys sake for my own sake i shall try to avoid it i said brusquely whereat his eyes glittered strangelyit is myself i have to consider most of all i shall as i hinted to you this morning travel for a few years yesgo on a tigerhunting expedition in indiahe suggestedor kill elephants in africa it is what a great many men do when their wives forget themselves several wellknown husbands are abroad just now again the brilliant enigmatical smile flashed over his facebut i could not smile in answer i stared moodily out of the window at the bare autumnal fields past which the train flewbare of harveststripped of foliagelike my own miserable life come and winter with me in egypthe continuedcome in my yacht the flamewe will take her to alexandriaand then do the nile in a dahabeah and forget that such frivolous dolls as women exist except to be played with </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> with by us superior creatures and thrown aside egyptthe nile i murmuredsomehow the idea pleased meyeswhy not why not indeed he echoedthe proposal is agreeable to you i am sure come and see the land of the old godsthe land where my princess used to live and torture the souls of menperhaps we may discover the remains of her last victimwho knows i avoided his gazethe recollection of the horrible winged thing he persisted in imagining to be the transmigrated soul of an evil woman was repugnant to me almost i felt as if there were some subtle connection between that hateful creature and my wife sibyl i was glad when the train reached london and we taking a hansom were plunged into the very vortex of human life the perpetual noise of traffic the motley crowds of people the shouting of newsboys and omnibusconductorsall this hubbub was grateful to my ears and for a time at least distracted my thoughts we lunched at the savoy and amused ourselves with noting the town noodles of fashionthe inane young man in the stocks of the stiff high collar and wearing the manacles of equally stiff and exaggerated cuffs a veritable prisoner in the dock of silly customthe frivolous fool of a woman painted and powdered with false hair and dyed eyebrows trying to look as much like a paid courtezan as possiblethe elderly matron skipping forward on high heels and attempting by the assumption of juvenile airs and graces to cover up and conceal the obtrusive facts of a too obvious paunch and overlapping bosomthe wouldbe dandy and beau of seventy strangely possessed by youthful desires and manifesting the same by goatlike caperings at the heels of young married womenthese and suchlike contemptible units of a contemptible social swarm passed before us like puppets at a country fair and aroused us in turn to laughter or disdain while we yet lingered over our wine a man came in alone and sat down at the table next to ourshe had with him a book which after giving his orders for luncheon he at once opened at a marked place and began to read with absorbed attentioni recognised the cover of the volume and knew it to be mavis clares differences a haze floated before my sighta sensation of rising tears was in my throati saw the fair face earnest eyes and sweet smile of mavisthat womanwearer of the laurelcrownthat keeper of the lilies of purity and peace alas those liliesthey were for me des fleurs tranges3 avec leurs airs de sceptres danges de thyrses lumineux pour doigts de sraphins leurs parfums sont trop forts tout ensemble et trop fins i shaded my eyes with one handyet under that shade i felt that lucio watched me closely presently he spoke softly just as if he had read my thoughts considering the effect a perfectly innocent woman has on the mind of even an evil man its strange isnt it that there are so few of them i did not answer in the present day he went onthere are a number of females clamouring like unnatural hens in a barnyard about their rights and wrongs their greatest right their highest privilege is to guide and guard the souls of men this they for the most part throw away as worthless aristocratic women royal women even hand over the care of their children to hired attendants and inferiors and then are surprised and injured if those children turn out to be either fools or blackguards if i were controller of the state i would make it a law that every mother should be bound to nurse and guard her children herself as nature intended unless prevented by illhealth in which case she would have to get a couple of doctors certificates to certify the fact otherwise any woman refusing to comply with the law should be sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour this would bring them to their senses the idleness wickedness extravagance and selfishness of women make men the boors and egotists they are i looked up the devil is in the whole businessi said bitterlyif women were good men would have nothing to do with them look round you at what is called society how many men there are who deliberately choose tainted women for their wives and leave the innocent uncared for take mavis clare oh you were thinking of mavis clare were you he rejoined with a quick glance at mebut she would be a difficult prize for any man to win she does not seek to be marriedand she is not uncared for since the whole world cares for her that is a sort of impersonal lovei answeredit does not give her the protection such a woman needs and ought to obtain do you want to become her lover he asked with a slight smileim afraid youve no chance i her lover good god i exclaimed the blood rushing hotly to my face at the mere suggestionwhat a profane idea you are rightit is profanehe agreed still smilingit is as though i should propose your stealing the sacramental cup from a church with just this differenceyou might succeed in running off with the cup because it is only the churchs property but you would never succeed in winning mavis clare inasmuch as she belongs to god you know what milton says so dear to heaven is saintly chastity that when a soul is found sincerely so a thousand liveried angels lacquey her driving far off each thing of sin and guilt and in clear dream and solemn vision tell her of things which no gross ear can hear till oft converse with heavenly habitants begin to cast a beam on thoutward shape the unpolluted temple of the mind and turns it by degrees to the souls essence till all be made immortal he quoted the lines softly and with an exquisite gravity that is what you see in mavis clarehe continuedthat beam on the outward shape which turns it by degrees to the souls essenceand which makes her beautiful without what is called beauty by lustful men i moved impatiently and looked out from the window near which we were seated at the yellow width of the flowing thames below beauty according to mans ordinary standard pursued lucio means simply good fleshnothing more flesh arranged prettily and roundly on the always ugly skeleton beneathflesh daintily coloured and soft to the touch without scar or blemish plenty of it too disposed in the proper places it is the most perishable sort of commodityan illness spoils ita trying climate ruins itage wrinkles itdeath destroys itbut it is all the majority of men look for in their bargains with the fair sex the most utter rou of sixty that ever trotted jauntily down piccadilly pretending to be thirty expects like shylock his pound or several pounds of youthful flesh the desire is neither refined nor intellectual but there it isand it is solely on this account that the ladies of the musichall become the tainted members and future mothers of the aristocracy it does not need the ladies of the musichall to taint the already tainted i said true and he looked at me with kindly commiserationlet us put the whole mischief down to the new fiction we rose then having finished luncheon and leaving the savoy we went on to arthurs here we sat down in a quiet corner and began to talk of our future plans it took me very little time to make up my mindall quarters of the world were the same to me and i was really indifferent as to where i went yet there is always something suggestive and fascinating about the idea of a first visit to egypt and i willingly agreed to accompany lucio thither and remain the winter we will avoid societyhe saidthe wellbred welleducated swagger people who throw champagnebottles at the sphinx and think a donkeyrace ripping fun shall not have the honour of our company cairo is full of such dancing dolls so we will not stay there old nile has many attractions and lazy luxury on a dahabeah will soothe your overwrought nerves i suggest our leaving england within a week i consentedand while he went over to a table and wrote some letters in preparation for our journey i looked through the days papers there was nothing to read in themfor though all the worlds news palpitates into great britain on obediently throbbing electric wires each editor of each little pennyworth being jealous of every other editor of every other pennyworth only admits into his columns exactly what suits his politics or personally pleases his taste and the interests of the public at large are scarcely considered poor bamboozled patient publicno wonder it is beginning to think that a halfpenny spent on a newspaper which is only purchased to be thrown away enough and more than enough i was still glancing up and down the tedious columns of the americanized pall mall gazette and lucio was still writing when a pageboy entered with a telegram mr tempest yes and i snatched the yellowcovered missive and tore it openand read the few words it contained almost uncomprehendingly they ran thus return at once something alarming has happened afraid to act without you mavis clare a curious chill came over methe telegram fell </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> fell from my hands on the table lucio took it up and glanced at it then regarding me stedfastly he said of course you must go you can catch the fourforty train if you take a hansom and you i muttered my throat was dry and i could scarcely speak ill stay at the grand and wait for news dont delay a momentmiss clare would not have taken it upon herself to send this message unless there had been serious cause what do you thinkwhat do you suppose i began he stopped me by a slight imperative gesture i think nothingi suppose nothing i only urge you to start immediately come and almost before i realized it he had taken me with him out into the hall of the club where he helped me on with my coat gave me my hat and sent for a cab to take me to the railway station we scarcely exchanged farewellsstupefied with the suddenness of the unexpected summons back to the home i had left in the morning as i thought for ever i hardly knew what i was doing or where i was going till i found myself alone in the train returning to warwickshire as fast as steam would bear me with the gloom of the deepening dusk around me and such a fear and horror at my heart as i dared not think of or define what was the something alarming that had happened how was it that mavis clare had telegraphed to me these and endless other questions tormented my brainand i was afraid to suggest answers to any of them when i arrived at the familiar station there was no one waiting to receive me so i hired a fly and was driven up to my own house just as the short evening deepened into night a low autumnal wind was sighing restlessly among the trees like a wandering soul in torment not a star shone in the black depths of the sky directly the carriage stopped a slim figure in white came out under the porch to meet meit was mavis her angels face grave and pale with emotion it is you at last she said in a trembling voicethank god you have come 3 edmond rostand la princesse lointaine xxxiv i grasped her hands hard what is iti beganthen looking round i saw that the hall was full of panicstricken servants some of whom came forward confusedly murmuring together about being afraid and not knowing what to do i motioned them back by a gesture and turned again to mavis clare tell mequickwhat is wrong we fear something has happened to lady sibylshe replied at onceher rooms are locked and we cannot make her hear her maid got alarmed and ran over to my house to ask me what was best to be donei came at once and knocked and called but could get no response you know the windows are too high to reach from the groundthere is no ladder on the premises long enough for the purposeand no one can climb up that side of the building i begged some of the servants to break open the door by forcebut they would notthey were all afraid and i did not like to act on my own responsibility so i telegraphed for you i sprang away from her before she had finished speaking and hurried upstairs at onceoutside the door of the anteroom which led into my wifes luxurious suite of apartments i paused breathless sibyl i cried there was not a sound mavis had followed me and stood by my side trembling a little two or three of the servants had also crept up the stairs and were clinging to the banisters listening nervously sibyl i called again still absolute silence i turned round upon the waiting and anxious domestics with an assumption of calmness lady sibyl is probably not in her rooms at alli said she may have gone out unobserved this door of the antechamber has a springlockit can easily get fast shut by the merest accident bring a strong hammeror a crowbaranything that will break it openif you had had sense you would have obeyed miss clare and done this a couple of hours ago and i waited with enforced composure while my instructions were carried out as rapidly as possible two of the menservants appeared with the necessary tools and very soon the house resounded with clamourblow after blow was dealt upon the solid oaken door for some time without successthe spring lock would not yieldneither would the strong hinges give way presently however after ten minutes hard labour one of the finely carved panels was smashed inthen anotherand springing over the dbris i rushed through the anteroom into the boudoirthen paused listening and calling again sibyl no one followed mesome indefinable instinct some nameless dread held the servants back and mavis clare as well i was alone and in complete darkness groping about with my heart beating furiously i sought for the ivory button in the wall which would at pressure flood the rooms with electric light but somehow i could not find it my hand came in contact with various familiar things which i recognised by touchrare bits of china bronzes vases picturescostly trifles that were heaped up as i knew in this particular apartment with a lavish luxury and disregard of cost befitting a wanton eastern empress of old timecautiously feeling my way along i started with terror to see as i thought a tall figure outline itself suddenly against the darknesswhite spectral and luminousa figure that as i stared at it aghast raised a pallid hand and pointed me forward with a menacing air of scorn in my dazed horror at this apparition or delusion i stumbled over the heavy trailing folds of a velvet portire and knew by this that i had passed from the boudoir into the adjoining bedroom again i stoppedcalling sibyl but my voice had scarcely strength enough to raise itself above a whisper giddy and confused as i was i remembered that the electric light in this room was fixed at the side of the toilettable and i stepped hurriedly in that direction when all at once in the thick gloom i touched something clammy and cold like dead flesh and brushed against a garment that exhaled faint perfume and rustled at my touch with a silken sound this alarmed me more thoroughly than the spectre i fancied i had just seeni drew back shudderingly against the walland in so doing my fingers involuntarily closed on the polished ivory stud which like a fairy talisman in modern civilization emits radiance at the owners will i pressed it nervouslythe light blazed forth through the rosetinted shells which shaded its dazzling clearness and showed me where i stood within an arms length of a strange stiff white creature that sat staring at itself in the silverframed mirror with wideopen fixed and glassy eyes sibyl i gaspedmy wife but the words died chokingly in my throat was it indeed my wifethis frozen statue of a woman watching her own impassive image thus intently i looked upon her wonderinglydoubtinglyas if she were some strangerit took me time to recognize her features and the bronzegold darkness of her long hair which fell loosely about her in a lavish wealth of rippling waves her left hand hung limply over the arm of the chair in which like some carven ivory goddess she sat enthronedand tremblingly slowly reluctantly i advanced and took that hand cold as ice it lay in my palm much as though it were a waxen model of itselfit glittered with jewelsand i studied every ring upon it with a curious dull pertinacity like one who seeks a clue to identity that large turquoise in a diamond setting was a marriagegift from a duchessthat opal her father gave herthe lustrous circle of sapphires and brilliants surmounting her weddingring was my giftthat ruby i seemed to knowwell well what a mass of sparkling value wasted on such fragile clay i peered into her facethen at the reflection of that face in the mirrorand again i grew perplexedwas it could it be sibyl after all sibyl was beautifulthis dead thing had a devilish smile on its blue parted lips and frenzied horror in its eyes suddenly something tense in my brain seemed to snap and give waydropping the chill fingers i held i cried aloud mavis mavis clare in a moment she was with mein a glance she comprehended all falling on her knees by the dead woman she broke into a passion of weeping oh poor girl she criedoh poor unhappy misguided girl i stared at her gloomily it seemed to me very strange that she should weep for sorrows not her own there was a fire in my braina confused trouble in my thoughtsi looked at my dead wife with her fixed gaze and evil smile sitting rigidly upright and robed in the mocking sheen of her rosesilk peignoir showered with old lace after the costliest of paris fashionsthen at the living tendersouled earnest creature famed for her genius throughout the world who knelt on the ground sobbing over the stiffening hand on which so many rare gems glistened derisivelyand an impulse rose in me stronger than myself moving me to wild and clamorous speech get </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> get up mavis i crieddo not kneel there gogo out of this roomout of my sight you do not know what she wasthis woman whom i marriedi deemed her an angel but she was a fiendyes mavis a fiend look at her staring at her own image in the glassyou cannot call her beautifulnow she smiles you seejust as she smiled last night when ah you know nothing of last night i tell you go and i stamped my foot almost furiouslythis air is contaminatedit will poison you the perfume of paris and the effluvia of death intermingled are sufficient to breed a pestilence go quicklyinform the household their mistress is deadhave the blinds drawn downshow all the exterior signs of decent and fashionable woeand i began laughing deliriouslytell the servants they may count upon expensive mourningfor all that money can do shall be done in homage to king death let everyone in the place eat and drink as much as they can or willand sleep or chatter as such menials love to do of hearses graves and sudden disastersbut let me be left alonealone with herwe have much to say to one another white and trembling mavis rose up and stood gazing at me in fear and pity alone she falteredyou are not fit to be alone no i am not fit to be but i must bei rejoined quickly and harshlythis woman and i lovedafter the manner of brutes and were wedded or rather mated in a similar manner though an archbishop blessed the pairing and called upon heaven to witness its sanctity yet we parted ill friendsand dead though she is i choose to pass the night with heri shall learn much knowledge from her silence tomorrow the grave and the servants of the grave may claim her but tonight she is mine the girls sweet eyes brimmed over with tears oh you are too distracted to know what you are saying she murmuredyou do not even try to discover how she died that is easy enough to guessi answered quickly and i took up a small darkcoloured bottle labelled poison which i had already perceived on the toilettablethis is uncorked and empty what it contained i do not knowbut there must be an inquest of coursepeople must be allowed to make money for themselves out of her ladyships rash act and see there here i pointed to some loose sheets of notepaper covered with writing and partially concealed by a filmy lace handkerchief which had evidently been hastily thrown across them and a pen and inkstand close bythere is some admirable reading prepared for me doubtlessthe last message from the beloved dead is sacred mavis clare surely you a writer of tender romances can realize thisand realizing it you will do as i ask youleave me she looked at me in deep compassion and slowly turned to go god help you she said sobbinglygod console you at this some demon in me broke loose and springing to her side i caught her hands in mine do not dare to talk of god i said in passionate accents not in this roomnot in that presence why should you call curses down upon me the help of god means punishmentthe consolations of god are terrible for strength must acknowledge itself weak before he will help itand a heart must be broken before he will console it but what do i sayi believe in no god i believe in an unknown force that encompasses me and hunts me down to the grave but nothing more she thought as i doand with reasonfor what has god done for her she was made evil from the firsta born snare of satan something caught my breath herei stopped unable to utter another word mavis stared at me affrighted and i stared back again what is it she whispered alarmedly i struggled to speakfinally with difficulty i answered her nothing and i motioned her away with a gesture of entreaty the expression of my face must have startled or intimidated her i fancy for she retreated hastily and i watched her disappearing as if she were the phantom of a dreamthen as she passed out through the boudoir i drew close the velvet portire behind her and locked the intermediate door this done i went slowly back to the side of my dead wife now sibyli said aloudwe are alone you and ialone with our own reflected imagesyou dead and i living you have no terrors for me in your present conditionyour beauty has gone your smile your eyes your touch cannot stir me to a throb of the passion you craved yet wearied of what have you to say to mei have heard that the dead can speak at timesand you owe me reparationreparation for the wrong you did methe lie on which you based our marriagethe guilt you cherished in your heart shall i read your petition for forgiveness here and i gathered up the written sheets of notepaper in one hand feeling them rather than seeing them for my eyes were fixed on the pallid corpse in its rosesilk neglige and jewels that gazed at itself so pertinaciously in the shining mirror i drew a chair close to it and sat down observing likewise the reflection of my own haggard face in the glass beside that of the selfmurdered woman turning presently i began to scrutinize my immovable companion more closelyand perceived that she was very lightly clothedunder the silk peignoir there was only a flowing white garment of soft fine material lavishly embroidered through which the statuesque contour of her rigid limbs could be distinctly seen stooping i felt her hearti knew it was pulseless yet i half imagined i should feel its beat as i withdrew my hand something scaly and glistening caught my eye and looking i perceived lucios marriagegift circling her waistthe flexible emerald snake with its diamond crest and ruby eyes it fascinated mecoiled round that dead body it seemed alive and sentientif it had lifted its glittering head and hissed at me i should scarcely have been surprised i sat back for a moment in my chair almost as rigid as the corpse beside mei stared again as the corpse stared always into the mirror which pictured us both we twain in one as the sentimentalists aver of wedded folk though in truth it often happens that there are no two creatures in the world more widely separated than husband and wife i heard stealthy movements and suppressed whisperings in the passage outside and guessed that some of the servants were there watching and waitingbut i cared nothing for that i was absorbed in the ghastly night interview i had planned for myself and i so entered into the spirit of the thing that i turned on all the electric lamps in the room besides lighting two tall clusters of shaded candles on either side of the toilettable when all the surroundings were thus rendered as brilliant as possible so that the corpse looked more livid and ghastly by comparison i seated myself once more and prepared to read the last message of the dead now sibyli muttered leaning forward a little and noting with a morbid interest that the jaws of the corpse had relaxed a little within the last few minutes and that the smile on the face was therefore more hideousconfess your sinsfor i am here to listen such dumb impressive eloquence as yours deserves attention a gust of wind fled round the house with a wailing crythe windows shook and the candles flickered i waited till every sound had died away and thenwith a glance at my dead wife under the sudden impression that she had heard what i said and knew what i was doing i began to read xxxv thus ran the last document commencing abruptly and without prefix i have made up my mind to die not out of passion or petulancebut from deliberate choice and as i think necessity my brain is tired of problemsmy body is tired of life it is best to make an end the idea of deathwhich means annihilationis very sweet to me i am glad to feel that by my own will and act i can silence this uneasy throbbing of my heart this turmoil and heat of my bloodthis tortured aching of my nerves young as i am i have no delight now in existencei see nothing but my loves luminous eyes his godlike features his enthralling smileand these are lost to me for a brief while he has been my world life and timehe has goneand without him there is no universe how could i endure the slow wretched passing of hours days weeks months and years alonethough it is better to be alone than in the dull companionship of the selfsatisfied complacent and arrogant fool who is my husband he has left me for ever so he says in a letter the maid brought to me an hour ago it is quite what i expected of himwhat man of his type could find pardon for a blow to his own amour propre if he had studied my nature entered into my emotions or striven in the least to guide and sustain meif he had shown me any sign of a great true love such as one sometimes dreams of </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> of and seldom findsi think i should be sorry for him nowi should even ask his forgiveness for having married him but he has treated me precisely as he might treat a paid mistressthat is he has fed me clothed me and provided me with money and jewels in return for making me the toy of his passionsbut he has not given me one touch of sympathyone proof of selfdenial or humane forbearance therefore i owe him nothing and now he and my love who will not be my lover have gone away together i am free to do as i will with this small pulse within me called life which is after all only a thread easily broken there is no one to say me nay or to hold my hand back from giving myself the final quietus it is well i have no friends it is good for me that i have probed the hypocrisy and social sham of the world and that i have mastered the following hard truths of lifethat there is no love without lustno friendship without selfinterestno religion without avariceand no socalled virtue without its accompanying stronger vice who knowing these things would care to take part in them on the verge of the grave i look back along the short vista of my years and i see myself a child in this very place this wooded willowsmere i can note how that life began to which i am about to put an end pampered petted and spoilt told that i must look pretty and take pleasure in my clothes i was even at the age of ten capable of a certain amount of coquetry old rous smelling of wine and tobacco were eager to take me on their knees and pinch my soft fleshthey would press my innocent lips with their withered oneswithered and contaminated by the kisses of cocottes and soiled doves of the towni have often wondered how it is these men can dare to touch a young childs mouth knowing in themselves what beasts they are i see my nursea trained liar and timeserver giving herself more airs than a queen and forbidding me to speak to this child or that child because they were beneath methen came my governess full of a prurient prudery as bad a woman in morals as ever lived yet highly recommended and with excellent references and wearing an assumption of the strictest virtue like many equally hypocritical clergymens wives i have known i soon found her outfor even as a child i was painfully observantand the stories she and my mothers french maid used to tell in lowered voices now and then broken by coarse laughter were sufficient to enlighten me as to her true character yet beyond having a supreme contempt for the woman who practised religious austerity outwardly and was at heart a rake i gave small consideration to the difficult problem such a nature suggested i livedhow strange it seems that i should be writing now of myself as past and done withyes i lived in a dreamy more or less idyllic state of mind thinking without being conscious of thought full of fancies concerning the flowers trees and birdswishing for things of which i knew nothingimagining myself a queen at times and again a peasant i was an omnivorous readerand i was specially fond of poetry i used to pore over the mystic verse of shelley and judged him then as a sort of demigodand never even when i knew all about his life could i realize him as a man with a thin shrieking falsetto voice and loose notions concerning women but i am quite sure it was good for his fame that he was drowned in early youth with so many melancholy and dramatic surroundingsit saved him i consider from a possibly vicious and repulsive old age i adored keats till i knew he had wasted his passion on a fanny brawnand then the glamour of him vanished i can offer no reason for thisi merely set down the fact i made a hero of lord byronin fact he has always formed for me the only heroical type of poet strong in himself and pitiless in his love for women he treated them for the most part as they merited considering the singular and unworthy specimens of the sex it was his misfortune to encounter i used to wonder when reading these mens amorous lines whether love would ever come my way and what beatific state of emotion i should then enjoy then came the rough awakening from all my dreamschildhood melted into womanhoodand at sixteen i was taken up to town with my parents to know something of the ways and manners of society before finally coming out oh those ways and manners i learnt them to perfection astonished at first then bewildered and allowed no time to form any judgment on what i saw i was hurried through a general vague impression of things such as i had never imagined or dreamed of while i was yet lost in wonderment and kept constantly in companionship with young girls of my own rank and age who nevertheless seemed much more advanced in knowledge of the world than i my father suddenly informed me that willowsmere was lost to usthat he could not afford to keep it upand that we should return there no more ah what tears i shedwhat a fury of grief consumed mei did not then comprehend the difficult entanglements of either wealth or povertyall i could realize was that the doors of my dear old home were closed upon me for ever after that i think i grew cold and hard in disposition i had never loved my mother very dearlyin fact i had seen very little of her as she was always away visiting if not entertaining visitors and she seldom had me with herso that when she was suddenly struck down by a first shock of paralysis it affected me but little she had her doctors and nursesi had my governess still with me and my mothers sister aunt charlotte came to keep house for usso i began to analyse society for myself without giving any expression of my opinions on what i observed i was not yet out but i went everywhere where girls of my age were invited and perceived things without showing that i had any faculty of perception i cultivated a passionless and cold exteriora listless uninterested and frigid demeanorfor i discovered that this was accepted by many people as dullness or stupidity and that by assuming such a character certain otherwise crafty persons would talk more readily before me and betray themselves and their vices unawares thus my social education began in grim earnestwomen of title and renown would ask me to their quiet teas because i was what they were pleased to call a harmless girl rather pretty but dulland allow me to assist them in entertaining the lovers who called upon them while their husbands were out i remember that on one occasion a great lady famous for two things her diamonds and her intimacy with the queen kissed her cavaliere servente a noted sporting earl with considerable abandon in my presence he muttered something about mei heard itbut his amorous mistress merely answered in a whisperoh its only sibyl eltonshe understands nothing afterwards however when he had gone she turned to me with a grin and remarkedyou saw me kiss bertie didnt you i often do hes quite like my brother i made no replyi only smiled vaguely and the next day she sent me a valuable diamond ring which i at once returned to her with a prim little note stating that i was much obliged but that my father considered me too young as yet to wear diamonds why do i think of these trifles now i wondernow when i am about to take my leave of life and all its lies there is a little bird singing outside my bedroom windowsuch a pretty creature i suppose it is happyit should be as it is not human the tears are in my eyes as i listen to its sweet warbling and think that it will be living and singing still today at sunset when i am dead that last sentence was mere sentiment for i am not sorry to die if i felt the least regret about it i should not carry out my intention i must resume my narrativefor it is an analysis i am trying to make of myself to find out if i can whether there are no excuses to be found for my particular dispositionwhether it is not after all the education and training i have had that have made me what i am or whether indeed i was born evil from the first the circumstances that surrounded me did not at any rate tend to soften or improve my character i had just passed my seventeenth birthday when one morning my father called me into his library and told me the true position of his affairs i learned that he was crippled on all sides with debtthat he lived on advances made to him by jew usurersand that these advances were trusted to him solely on the speculation that i his only daughter would make a sufficiently rich </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> rich marriage to enable him to repay all loans with heavy interest he went on to say that he hoped i would act sensiblyand that when any men showed indications of becoming suitors for my hand i would before encouraging them inform him in order that he might make strict enquiries as to their actual extent of fortune i then understood for the first time that i was for sale i listened in silence till he had finishedthen i asked himlove i suppose is not to be considered in the matter he laughed and assured me it was much easier to love a rich man than a poor one as i would find out after a little experience he added with some hesitation that to help make both ends meet as the expenses of town life were considerable he had arranged to take a young american lady under his charge a miss diana chesney who wished to be introduced into english society and who would pay two thousand guineas a year to him for that privilege and for aunt charlottes services as chaperne i do not remember now what i said to him when i heard thisi know that my long suppressed feelings broke out in a storm of fury and that for the moment he was completely taken aback by the force of my indignation an american boarder in our houseit seemed to me as outrageous and undignified as the conduct of a person i once heard of who favoured by the queens patronage with free apartments in kensington palace took from time to time on the sly an american or colonial payingguest who adopted forthwith the address of her majestys birthplace as her own thus lowering the whole prestige of that historic habitation my wrath however was uselessthe bargain was arrangedmy father regardless of his proud lineage and the social dignity of his position had degraded himself in my opinion to the level of a sort of superior lodginghouse keeperand from that time i lost all my former respect for him of course it can be argued that i was wrongthat i ought to have honoured him for turning his name to monetary account by loaning it out as a protective shield and panoply for an american woman without anything but the dollars of a vulgar railwayking to back her up in societybut i could not see it in that light i retreated into myself more than everand became more than pleasantly known for my coldness reserve and hauteur miss chesney came and strove hard to be my friendbut she soon found that impossible she is a goodhearted creature i believebut she is badly bred and badly trained as all her compatriots are more or less despite their smattering of an european education i disliked her from the first and have spared no pains to show it yet i know she will be countess of elton as soon as it is decently possiblesay after the years ceremonious mourning for my mother has expired and perhaps three months hypocritical wearing of black for memy father believes himself to be still young and passably goodlooking and he is quite incapable of resisting the fortune she will bring him when she took up her fixed abode in our house and aunt charlotte became her paid chaperne i seldom went out to any social gatherings for i could not endure the idea of being seen in her companionship i kept to my own room a great deal and thus secluded read many books all the fashionable fiction of the day passed through my hands much to my gradual enlightenment if not to my edification one daya day that is stamped on my memory as a kind of turningpoint in my lifei read a novel by a woman which i did not at first entirely understandbut on going over some of its passages a second time all at once its horrible lasciviousness flashed upon me and filled me with such genuine disgust that i flung it on the ground in a fit of loathing and contempt yet i had seen it praised in all the leading journals of the day its obscenities were hinted at as daringits vulgarities were quoted as brilliant witin fact so many laudatory columns were written about it in the press that i resolved to read it again encouraged by the literary censors of the time i did so and little by little the insidious abomination of it filtered into my mind and stayed there i began to think about itand byandby found pleasure in thinking about it i sent for other books by the same tainted hand and my appetite for that kind of prurient romance grew keener at this particular juncture as chance or fate would have it an acquaintance of mine the daughter of a marchioness a girl with large black eyes and those full protruding lips which remind one unconsciously of a swines snout brought me two or three odd volumes of the poems of swinburne always devoted to poetry and considering it to be the highest of the arts and up to that period having been ignorant of this writers work i turned over the books with eagerness expecting to enjoy the usual sublime emotions which it is the privilege and glory of the poet to inspire in mortals less divinely endowed than himself and who turn to him for help to climb beyond the highest peaks of time now i should like if i could do so to explain clearly the effect of this satyrsongster upon my mindfor i believe there are many women to whom his works have been deadlier than the deadliest poison and far more soulcorrupting than any book of zolas or the most pernicious of modern french writers at first i read the poems quickly with a certain pleasure in the musical swing and jangle of rhythm and without paying much attention to the subjectmatter of the versebut presently as though a lurid blaze of lightning had stripped a fair tree of its adorning leaves my senses suddenly perceived the cruelty and sensuality concealed under the ornate language and persuasive rhymesand for a moment i paused in my reading and closed my eyes shuddering and sick at heart was human nature as base and abandoned as this man declared it to be was there no god but lust were men and women lower and more depraved in their passions and appetites than the very beasts i mused and dreamedi pored over the laus venerisfaustine and anactoria till i felt myself being dragged down to the level of the mind that conceived such outrages to decencyi drank in the poets own fiendish contempt of god and i read over and over again his verses before a crucifix till i knew them by hearttill they rang in my brain as persistently as any nursery jingle and drove my thoughts into as haughty a scorn of christ and his teachings as any unbelieving jew it is nothing to me nownow when without hope or faith or love i am about to take the final plunge into eternal darkness and silencebut for the sake of those who have the comfort of a religion i ask why in a socalled christian country is such a hideous blasphemy as before a crucifix allowed to circulate among the people without so much as one reproof from those who elect themselves judges of literature i have seen many noble writers condemned unheardmany have been accused of blasphemy whose works tend quite the other waybut these lines are permitted to work their cruel mischief unchecked and the writer of them is glorified as though he were a benefactor to mankind i quote them here from bitter memory that i may not be deemed as exaggerating their nature so when our souls look back to thee they sicken seeing against thy side too foul to speak of or to see the leprous likeness of a bride whose kissing lips through his lips grown leave their god rotten to the bone when we would see thee man and know what heart thou hadst towards man indeed lo thy bloodblackened altars lo the lips of priests that pray and feed while their own hells worm curls and licks the poison of the crucifix thou badst the children come to thee what children now but curses come what manhood in that god can be who sees their worship and is dumb no soul that lived loved wrought and died is this their carrion crucified nay if their god and thou be one if thou and this thing be the same thou shouldst not look upon the sun the sun grows haggard at thy name come down be done with cease give oer hide thyself strive not be no more from the time of reading this i used to think of christ as carrion crucifiedif i ever thought at all i found out that no one had ever reproached swinburne for this termthat it did not interfere with his chances for the laureateshipand that not even a priest of the church had been boldspoken or zealous enough in his masters cause to publicly resent the shameless outrage so i concluded that swinburne must after all be right in his opinions and i followed the lazy and unthinking course of social movement spending my days </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> days with such literature as stored my brain with a complete knowledge of things evil and pernicious whatever soul i had in me was killed the freshness of my mind was goneswinburne among others had helped me to live mentally if not physically through such a phase of vice as had poisoned my thoughts for ever i understand there is some vague law in existence about placing an interdiction on certain books considered injurious to public moralsif there is such a rule it has been curiously lax concerning the author of anactoriawho by virtue of being a poet passes unquestioned into many a home carrying impure suggestion into minds that were once cleanly and simple as for me after i had studied his verse to my hearts content nothing remained sacredi judged men as beasts and women as little betteri had no belief in honour virtue or truthand i was absolutely indifferent to all things save one and that was my resolve to have my own way as far as love was concerned i might be forced to marry without love for purely moneyconsiderationsbut all the same love i would have or what i called lovenot an ideal passion by any means but precisely what mr swinburne and a few of the mostpraised novelists of the day had taught me to consider as love i began to wonder when and how i should meet my loversuch thoughts as i had at this time indeed would have made moralists stare and uplift their hands in horrorbut to the exterior world i was the very pink and pattern of maidenly decorum reserve and pride men desired but feared me for i never gave them any encouragement seeing as yet none among them whom i deemed worthy of such love as i could give the majority resembled carefully trained baboonsrespectably clothed and artistically shavenbut nevertheless all with the spasmodic grin the leering eye and the uncouth gestures of the hairy woodland monster when i was just eighteen i came out in earnestthat is i was presented at court with all the foolish and farcical pomp practised on such occasions i was told before going that it was a great and necessary thing to be presentedthat it was a guarantee of position and above all of reputationthe queen received none whose conduct was not rigidly correct and virtuous what humbug it all wasi laughed then and i can smile now to think of itwhy the very woman who presented me had two illegitimate sons unknown to her lawful husband and she was not the only playful sinner in the court comedy some women were there that day whom since even i would not receiveso openly infamous are their lives and characters yet they make their demure curtseys before the throne at stated times and assume to be the very patterns of virtue and austerity now and then it chances in the case of an exceedingly beautiful woman of whom all the others are jealous that for her little slips she is selected as an example and excluded from court while her plainer sisters though sinning seventy times seven against all the laws of decency and morality are still receivedbut otherwise there is very little real care exercised as to the character and prestige of the women whom the queen receives if any one of them is refused it is certain she adds to her social enormities the greater crime of being beautiful otherwise there would be no one to whisper away her reputation i was what is called a success on my presentation day that is i was stared at and openly flattered by certain members of my sex who were too old and ugly to be jealous and treated with insolent contempt by those who were young enough to be my rivals there was a great crush to get into the throneroom and some of the ladies used rather strong language one duchess just in front of me said to her companiondo as i dokick out bruise their shins for themas hard as you canwe shall get on faster then this choice remark was accompanied by the grin of a fishwife and the stare of a drab yet it was a great lady who spokenot a transatlantic importation but a woman of distinguished lineage and connection her observation however was only one out of many similar speeches which i heard on all sides of me during the distinguished mlea thoroughly illmannered crush which struck me as supremely vulgar and totally unfitting the dignity of our sovereigns court when i curtsied before the throne at last and saw the majesty of the empire represented by a kindly faced old lady looking very tired and bored whose hand was as cold as ice when i kissed it i was conscious of an intense feeling of pity for her in her high estate who would be a monarch to be doomed to the perpetual receiving of a company of fools i got through my duties quickly and returned home more or less wearied out and disgusted with the whole ceremonyand next day i found that my debt had given me the position of a leading beauty or in other words that i was now formally put up for sale that is really what is meant by being presented and coming outthese are the fancy terms of ones parental auctioneer my life was now passed in dressing having my photograph taken giving sittings to aspiring fashionable painters and being inspected by men with a view to matrimony it was distinctly understood in society that i was not to be sold under a certain figure per annumand the price was too high for most wouldbe purchasers how sick i grew of my constant exhibition in the marriagemarket what contempt and hatred was fostered in me for the mean and pitiable hypocrisies of my set i was not long in discovering that money was the chiefmotive power of all social successthat the proudest and highest personages in the world could be easily gathered together under the roof of any vulgar plebeian who happened to have enough cash to feed and entertain them as an example of this i remember a woman ugly passe and squinteyed who during her fathers life was only allowed about halfacrown a week as pocketmoney up to her fortieth yearand who when that father died leaving her in possession of half his fortune the other half going to illegitimate children of whom she had never heard he having always posed as a pattern of immaculate virtue suddenly blossomed out as a leader of fashion and succeeded through cautious scheming and ungrudging toadyism in assembling some of the highest people in the land under her roof ugly and passe though she was and verging towards fifty with neither grace wit nor intelligence through the power of her cash alone she invited royal dukes and titles generally to her dinners and dancesand it is to their shame that they actually accepted her invitations such voluntary degradations on the part of really wellconnected people i have never been able to understandit is not as if they were actually in want of food or amusement for they have a surfeit of both every seasonand it seems to me that they ought to show a better example than to flock in crowds to the entertainments of a mere uninteresting and ugly nobody just because she happens to have money i never entered her house myself though she had the audacity to invite mei learned moreover that she had promised a friend of mine a hundred guineas if she could persuade me to make one appearance in her rooms for my renown as a beauty combined with my pride and exclusiveness would have given her parties a prestige greater than even royalty could bestowshe knew that and i knew thatand knowing it never condescended to so much as notice her by a bow but though i took a certain satisfaction in thus revenging myself on the atrocious vulgarity of parvenus and social interlopers i grew intensely weary of the monotony and emptiness of what fashionable folks call amusement and presently falling ill of a nervous fever i was sent down to the seaside for a few weeks change of air with a young cousin of mine a girl i rather liked because she was so different to myself her name was eva maitlandshe was but sixteen and extremely delicatepoor little soul she died two months before my marriage she and i and a maid to attend us went down to cromerand one day sitting on the cliffs together she asked me timidly if i knew an author named mavis clare i told her nowhereupon she handed me a book called the wings of psyche do read it she said earnestlyit will make you feel so happy i laughed the idea of a modern author writing anything to make one feel happy seemed to me quite ludicrous the aim of most of them being to awaken a disgust of life and a hatred of ones fellowcreatures however to please eva i read the wings of psycheand if it did not make me actually happy it moved me to a great wonder and deep reverence for the womanwriter of such a book i found out all about herthat she was young goodlooking of a </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> a noble character and unblemished reputation and that her only enemies were the presscritics this last point was so much in her favour with me that i at once bought everything she had ever written and her works became as it were my haven of rest her theories of life are strange poetic ideal and beautifulthough i have not been able to accept them or work them out in my own case i have always felt soothed and comforted for a while in the very act of wishing they were true and the woman is like her booksstrange poetic ideal and beautifulhow odd it is to think that she is within ten minutes walk of me nowi could send for her if i liked and tell her allbut she would prevent me carrying out my resolve she would cling to me womanlike and kiss me and hold my hands and say no sibyl no you are not yourselfyou must come to me and rest an odd fancy has seized me i will open my window and call her very gentlyshe might be in the garden coming here to see meand if she hears and answers who knowswhy perhaps my ideas may change and fate itself may take a different course well i have called her i have sent her name mavis softly out on the sunshine and still air three times and only a little brown namesake of hers a thrush swinging on a branch of fir answered me with his low autumnal piping mavis she will not cometoday god will not make her his messenger she cannot guessshe does not know this tragedy of my heart greater and more poignant than all the tragedies of fiction if she did know me as i am i wonder what she would think of me let me go back to the time when love came to melove ardent passionate and eternal ah what wild joy thrilled through me what mad ecstasy fired my bloodwhat delirious dreams possessed my braini saw lucioand it seemed as if the splendid eyes of some great angel had flashed a glory in my soul with him came his friend the foil to his beautythe arrogant selfsatisfied fool of a millionaire geoffrey tempesthe who bought me and who by virtue of his purchase is entitled by law to call himself my husband here i paused in my reading and looked up the dead womans eyes appeared now to regard me as steadily as herself in the opposite mirrorthe head was a little more dropped forward on the breast and the whole face very nearly resembled that of the late countess of elton when the last shock of paralysis had rendered her hideous disfigurement complete to think i loved that i said aloud pointing at the corpses ghastly reflectionfool that i was indeedas great a fool as all men are who barter their lives for the possession of a womans mere body why if there were any life after deathif such a creature had a soul that at all resembled this poisoned clay the very devils might turn away aghast from such a loathly comrade the candles flickered and the dead face seemed to smilea clock chimed in the adjoining room but i did not count the houri merely arranged the manuscript pages i held more methodically and read on with renewed attention xxxvi from the moment i saw lucio rimnezwent on sibyls dying speechi abandoned myself to love and the desire of love i had heard of him before from my father who had as i learned to my shame been indebted to him for monetary assistance on the very night we met my father told me quite plainly that now was my chance to get settled in life marry rimnez or tempest whichever you can most easily catch he saidthe prince is fabulously wealthybut he keeps up a mystery about himself and no one knows where he actually comes frombesides which he dislikes womennow tempest has five millions and seems an easygoing fooli should say you had better go for tempest i made no answer and gave no promise either way i soon found out however that lucio did not intend to marryand i concluded that he preferred to be the lover of many women instead of the husband of one i did not love him any the less for thisi only resolved that i would at least be one of those who were happy enough to share his passion i married the man tempest feeling that like many women i knew i should when safely wedded have greater liberty of actioni was aware that most modern men prefer an amour with a married woman to any other kind of liaisonand i thought lucio would have readily yielded to the plan i had preconceived but i was mistakenand out of this mistake comes all my perplexity pain and bewilderment i cannot understand why my lovebeloved beyond all word or thoughtshould scorn me and repulse me with such bitter loathing it is such a common thing nowadays for a married woman to have her own lover apart from her husband de convenance the writers of books advise iti have seen the custom not only excused but advocated over and over again in long and scientific articles that are openly published in leading magazines why then should i be blamed or my desires considered criminal as long as no public scandal is made what harm is done i cannot see itit is not as if there were a god to carethe scientists say there is no god i was very startled just now i thought i heard lucios voice calling me i have walked through the rooms looking everywhere and i opened my door to listen but there is no one i am alone i have told the servant not to disturb me till i ring i shall never ring now i come to think of it it is singular that i have never known who lucio really is a prince he saysand that i can well believethough truly princes nowadays are so plebeian and common in look and bearing that he seems too great to belong to so shabby a fraternity from what kingdom does he cometo what nation does he belong these are questions which he never answers save equivocally i pause here and look at myself in the mirror how beautiful i am i note with admiration the deep and dewy lustre of my eyes and their dark silky fringesi see the delicate colouring of my cheeks and lipsthe dear rounded chin with its pretty dimplethe pure lines of my slim throat and snowy neckthe glistening wealth of my long hair all this was given to me for the attraction and luring of men but my love whom i love with all this living breathing exquisite being of mine can see no beauty in me and rejects me with such scorn as pierces my very soul i have knelt to himi have prayed to himi have worshipped himin vain hence it comes that i must die only one thing he said that had the sound of hope though the utterance was fierce and his looks were cruelpatience he whisperedwe shall meet ere long what did he meanwhat possible meeting can there be now when death must close the gate of life and even love would come too late i have unlocked my jewelcase and taken from it the deadly thing secreted therea poison that was entrusted to me by one of the physicians who lately attended my mother keep this under lock and key he said and be sure that it is used only for external purposes there is sufficient in this flask to kill ten men if swallowed by mistake i look at it wonderingly it is colourlessand there is not enough to fill a teaspoon yet it will bring down upon me an eternal darkness and close up for ever the marvellous scenes of the universe so littleto do so much i have fastened lucios weddinggift round my waistthe beautiful snake of jewels that clings to me as though it were charged with an embrace from himah would i could cheat myself into so pleasing a fancy i am trembling but not with cold or fearit is simply an excitation of the nervesan instinctive recoil of flesh and blood at the near prospect of death how brilliantly the sun shines through my windowits callous golden stare has watched so many tortured creatures die without so much as a cloud to dim its radiance by way of the suggestion of pity if there were a god i fancy he would be like the sunglorious changeless unapproachable beautiful but pitiless out of all the various types of human beings i think i hate the class called poets most i used to love them and believe in them but i know them now to be mere weavers of liesbuilders of cloud castles in which no throbbing life can breathe no weary heart find rest love is their chief motivethey either idealize or degrade itand of the love we women long for most they have no conception they can only sing of brute passion or ethical impossibilitiesof the mutual great sympathy the ungrudging patient tenderness that should make love lovely they have no sweet things to say between their </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> their strained stheticism and unbridled sensualism my spirit has been stretched on the rack and broken on the wheel i should think many a wretched woman wrecked among loves disillusions must curse them as i do i am ready now i think there is nothing more to say i offer no excuses for myself i am as i was madea proud and rebellious woman selfwilled and sensual seeing no fault in free love and no crime in conjugal infidelityand if i am vicious i can honestly declare that my vices have been encouraged and fostered in me by most of the literary teachers of my time i married as most women of my set marry merely for moneyi loved as most women of my set love for mere bodily attractioni die as most women of my set will die either naturally or selfslain in utter atheism rejoicing that there is no god and no hereafter i had the poison in my hand a moment ago ready to take when i suddenly felt someone approaching me stealthily from behind and glancing up quickly at the mirror i saw my mother her face hideous and ghastly as it had been in her last illness was reflected in the glass peering over my shoulder i sprang up and confronted hershe was gone and now i am shivering with cold and i feel a chill dampness on my foreheadmechanically i have soaked a handkerchief with perfume from one of the silver bottles on the dressing table and have passed it across my temples to help me recover from this sick swooning sensation to recoverhow foolish of me seeing i am about to die i do not believe in ghostsyet i could have sworn my mother was actually present just nowof course it was an optical delusion of my own feverish brain the strong scent on my handkerchief reminds me of parisi can see the shop where i bought this particular perfume and the welldressed doll of a man who served me with his little waxed moustache and his indefinable french manner of conveying a speechless personal compliment while making out a bill laughing at this recollection i see my face radiate in the glassmy eyes flash into vivid lustre and the dimples near my lips come and go giving my expression an enchanting sweetness yet in a few hours this loveliness will be destroyedand in a few days the worms will twine where the smile is now an idea has come upon me that perhaps i ought to say a prayer it would be hypocriticalbut conventional to die fashionably one ought to concede a few words to the church and yet to kneel down with clasped hands and tell an inactive unsympathetic selfish paid community called the church that i am going to kill myself for the sake of love and loves despair and that therefore i humbly implore its forgiveness for the act seems absurdas absurd as to tell the same thing to a nonexistent deity i suppose the scientists do not think what a strange predicament their advanced theories put the human mind in at the hour of death they forget that on the brink of the grave thoughts come that will not be gainsaid and that cannot be appeased by a learned thesis however i will not prayit would seem to myself cowardly that i who have never said my prayers since i was a child should run over them now in a foolish babbling attempt to satisfy the powers invisiblei could not out of sheer association appeal to mr swinburnes crucified carrion besides i do not believe in the powers invisible at alli feel that once outside this life the rest as hamlet said is silence i have been staring dreamily and in a sort of stupefaction at the little poisonflask in my hand it is quite empty now i have swallowed every drop of the liquid it containedi took it quickly and determinately as one takes nauseous medicine without allowing myself another moment of time for thought or hesitation it tasted acrid and burning on my tonguebut at present i am not conscious of any strange or painful result i shall watch my face in the mirror and trace the oncoming of deaththis will be at any rate a new sensation not without interest my mother is herehere with me in this room she is moving about restlessly making wild gestures with her hands and trying to speak she looks as she did when she was dyingonly more alive more sentient i have followed her up and down but am unable to touch hershe eludes my grasp i have called her mother mother but no sound issues from her white lips her face is so appalling that i was seized with a convulsion of terror a moment ago and fell on my knees before her imploring her to leave meand then she paused in her gliding to and fro andsmiled what a hideous smile it was i think i lost consciousness for i found myself lying on the ground a sharp and terrible pain running through me made me spring to my feet and i bit my lips till they bled lest i should scream aloud with the agony i suffered and so alarm the house when the paroxysm passed i saw my mother standing quite near to me dumbly watching me with a strange expression of wonder and remorse i tottered past her and back to this chair where i now siti am calmer now and i am able to realize that she is only the phantom of my own brainthat i fancy she is here while knowing she is dead torture indescribable has made of me a writhing moaning helpless creature for the past few minutes truly that drug was deadlythe pain is horrible horrible it has left me quivering in every limb and palpitating in every nerve looking at my face in the glass i see that it has already altered it is drawn and lividall the fresh rosetint of my lips has gonemy eyes protrude unnaturally there are dull blue marks at the corners of my mouth and in the hollows of my temples and i observe a curious quick pulsation in the veins of my throat be my torment what it will now there is no remedyand i am resolved to sit here and study my own features to the end the reaper whose name is death must surely be near ready to gather my long hair in his skeleton hand like a sheaf of ripe corn my poor beautiful hairhow i have loved its glistening ripples and brushed it and twined it round my fingers and how soon it will lie like a dank weed in the mould a devouring fire is in my brain and bodyi am burning with heat and parched with thirsti have drunk deep draughts of cold water but this has not relieved me the sun glares in upon me like an open furnacei have tried to rise and close the blind against it but find i have no force to stand upright the strong radiance blinds methe silver toilet boxes on my table glitter like so many points of swords it is by a powerful effort of will that i am able to continue writingmy head is swimming roundand there is a choking sensation in my throat a moment since i thought i was dying torn asunder as it were by the most torturing pangs i could have screamed for helpand would have done so had voice been left me but i cannot speak above a whisperi mutter my own name to myself sibyl sibyl and can scarcely hear it my mother stands beside meapparently waitinga little while ago i thought i heard her say come sibyl come to your chosen lover now i am conscious of a great silence everywherea numbness has fallen upon me and a delicious respite from painbut i see my face in the glass and know it is the face of the dead it will soon be all overa few more uneasy breathingsand i shall be at rest i am gladfor the world and i were never good friendsi am sure that if we could know before we were born what life really is we should never take the trouble to live a horrible fear has suddenly beset me what if death were not what the scientists deem itsuppose it were another form of life can it be that i am losing reason and courage together or what is this terrible misgiving that is taking possession of me i begin to falter a strange sense of horror is creeping over me i have no more physical pain but something worse than pain oppresses me a feeling that i cannot define i am dying dyingi repeat this to myself for comfort in a little while i shall be deaf and blind and unconscious why then is the silence around me now broken through by sound i listenand i hear distinctly the clamour of wild voices mingled with a sullen jar and roll as of distant thunder my mother stands closer to me she is stretching out her hand to touch mine oh god let me writewritewhile i can let me yet hold fast the thread which fastens me to earthgive me timetime before i drift </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> drift out lost in yonder blackness and flame let me write for others the awful truth as i see itthere is no death nonenonei cannot die i am passing out of my bodyi am being wrenched away from it inch by inch in inexplicable mystic torturebut i am not dyingi am being carried forward into a new life vague and vast i see a new world

existencethere is nothing in the universe but life o hideous miseryi cannot die in my mortal body i can scarcely breathethe pen i try to hold writes of itself rather than through my shaking handbut these pangs are the throes of birthnot death i hold backwith all the force of my soul i strive not to plunge into that black abyss i see before mebutmy mother drags me with heri cannot shake her off i

misery of this new life and worst of allgod whom i doubted god whom i was taught to deny this wronged blasphemed and outraged god exists and i could have found him had i chosenthis knowledge is forced

further darkness amid wind and fire serve me dead hand once more ere i depart my tortured spirit must seize and compel you to write down this thing unnameable that earthly eyes may read and earthly souls take timely warning i know at last whom i have lovedwhom i have chosen whom i have worshipped oh god have mercy i know who claims my worship now and drags me into yonder rolling world of flame his name is here the manuscript endedincomplete and broken off abruptlyand there was a blot on the last sentence as though the pen had been violently wrenched from the dying fingers and hastily flung down the clock in the west room again chimed the hour i rose stiffly from my chair tremblingmy selfpossession was giving way and i began to feel at last unnerved i looked askance at my dead wifeshe who with a superhuman dying effort had declared herself to be yet alivewho in some imaginable strange way had seemingly written after death in a frantic desire to make some appalling declaration which nevertheless remained undeclared the rigid figure of the corpse had now real terrors for mei dared not touch iti scarcely dared look at it in some dim inscrutable fashion i felt as if scarlet wings environed it beating me down yet pressing me onme too in my turn with the manuscript gathered close in my hand i bent nervously forward to blow out the wax lights on the toilet table i saw on the floor the handkerchief odorous with the french perfume the dead woman had written ofi picked it up and placed it near her where she sat grinning hideously at her own mirrored ghastliness the flash of the jewelled serpent round her waist caught my eyes anew as i did this and i stared for a moment at its green glitter dumbly fascinatedthen moving stealthily with the cold sweat pouring down my back and every pulse in me rendered feeble by sheer horror i turned to leave the room as i reached the portire and lifted it some instinct made me look back at the dread picture of the leading society beauty sitting stark and livid pale before her own stark and lividpale image in the glasswhat a fashionplate she would make now i thought for a frivolous and hypocritical ladies paper you say you are not dead sibyl i muttered aloudnot dead but living then if you are alive where are you sibylwhere are you the heavy silence seemed fraught with fearful meaningthe light of the electric lamps on the corpse and on the shimmering silk garment wrapped round it appeared unearthlyand the perfume in the room had a gravelike earthy smell a panic seized me and dragging frantically at the portire till all its velvet folds were drawn thickly together i made haste to shut out from my sight the horrible figure of the woman whose bodily fairness i had loved in the customary way of sensual menand left her without so much as a pardoning or pitying kiss of farewell on the cold brow for after all i had myself to think of and she was dead xxxvii i pass over all the details of polite shock affected sorrow and feigned sympathy of society at my wifes sudden death no one was really grieved about itmen raised their eyebrows shrugged their shoulders lit extra cigarettes and dismissed the subject as too unpleasant and depressing to dwell uponwomen were glad of the removal of a too beautiful and too much admired rival and the majority of fashionable folk delighted in having something thrilling to talk about in the tragic circumstances of her end as a rule people are seldom or never unselfish enough to be honestly sorry for the evanishment of some leading or brilliant figure from their midstthe vacancy leaves room for the pushing in of smaller fry be sure that if you are unhappily celebrated for either beauty wit intellect or all three together half society wishes you dead already and the other half tries to make you as wretched as possible while you are alive to be missed at all when you die some one must love you very deeply and unselfishly and deep unselfish love is rarer to find among mortals than a pearl in a dustbin thanks to my abundance of cash everything concerning sibyls suicide was admirably managed in consideration of her social position as an earls daughter two doctors certified on my paying them very handsome fees that hers was a death by misadventurenamely through taking an accidental overdose of a powerful sleeping draught it was the best report to makeand the most respectable it gave the penny press an opportunity of moralizing on the dangers that lurked in sleeping draughts generallyand tom dick and harry all wrote letters to their favorite periodicals signing their names in full giving their opinions as to the nature of sleeping draughts so that for a week at least the ordinary dullness of the newspapers was quite enlivened by ungrammatical gratis copy the conventionalities of law decency and order were throughout scrupulously observed and complied witheverybody was paid which was the chief thing and everybody was i believe satisfied with what they managed to make out of the deathpayment the funeral gave joy to the souls of all undertakersit was so expensive and impressive the florists trade gained something of an impetus by the innumerable orders received for wreaths and crosses made of the costliest flowers when the coffin was carried to the grave it could not be seen for the load of blossoms that covered it and amid all the cards and loving tokens and farewell dearests and notlostbutgonebeforesthat ticketed the white masses of lilies gardenias and roses which were supposed to symbolize the innocence and sweetness of the poisoned corpse they were sent to adorn there was not one honest regretnot one unfeigned expression of true sorrow lord elton made a sufficiently striking figure of dignified parental woe but on the whole i think he was not sorry for his daughters death since the only opposing obstacle to his marriage with diana chesney was now removed i fancy diana herself was sorry so far as such a frivolous little american could be sorry for anythingperhaps however it would be more correct to say that she was frightened sibyls sudden end startled and troubled herbut i am not sure that it grieved her there is such a difference between unselfish grief and the mere sense of nervous personal shock miss charlotte fitzroy took the news of her nieces death with that admirable fortitude which frequently characterizes religious spinsters of a certain age she put by her knittingsaid gods will be done and sent for her favorite clergyman he came stayed with her some hours </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> hours drinking strong teaand the next morning at church administered to her communion this done miss fitzroy went on the blameless and even tenor of her way wearing the same virtuously distressed expression as usual and showed no further sign of feeling i as the afflicted millionairehusband was no doubt the most interesting figure on the scene i was i know very well got up thanks to my tailor and to the affectionate care of the chief undertaker who handed me my black gloves on the day of the funeral with servile solicitude but in my heart i felt myself to be a far better actor than henry irving and if only for my admirable mimicry of heartbreak more fully worthy of the accolade lucio did not attend the obsequieshe wrote me a brief note of sympathy from town and hinted that he was sure i could understand his reasons for not being present i did understand of courseand appreciated his respect as i thought for me and my feelingsyet strange and incongruous as it may seem i never longed so much for his company as i did then howeverwe had a glorious burial of my fair and false ladyprancing horses drew coroneted carriages in a long defile down the pretty warwickshire lanes to the grey old church picturesque and peaceful where the clergyman and his assistants in newlywashed surplices met the flowerladen coffin and with the usual conventional mumblings consigned it to the dust there were even pressreporters present who not only described the scene as it did not happen but who also sent fancy sketches to their respective journals of the church as it did not exist i mention this simply to show how thoroughly all proper forms were carried out and conceded to after the ceremony all we mourners went back to willowsmere to luncheon and i well remember that lord elton told me a new and risqu joke over a glass of port before the meal was finished the undertakers had a sort of festive banquet in the servants halland taking everything into due consideration my wifes death gave a great deal of pleasure to many people and put useful money into several ready pockets she had left no blank in society that could not be easily filled upshe was merely one butterfly out of thousands more daintily coloured perhaps and more restless in flightbut never judged as more than up to the butterfly standard i said no one gave her an honest regret but i was wrong mavis clare was genuinely almost passionately grieved she sent no flowers for the coffin but she came to the funeral by herself and stood a little apart waiting silently till the grave was covered inand then just as the fashionable train of mourners were leaving the churchyard she advanced and placed a white cross of her own gardenlilies upon the newlyturned brown mould i noticed her action and determined that before i left willowsmere for the east with lucio for my journey had only been postponed a week or two on account of sibyls death she should know all the day came when i carried out this resolve it was a rainy and chill afternoon and i found mavis in her study sitting beside a bright log fire with her small terrier in her lap and her faithful st bernard stretched at her feet she was absorbed in a bookand over her watched the marble pallas inflexible and austere as i entered she rose and putting down the volume and her pet dog together she advanced to meet me with an intense sympathy in her clear eyes and a wordless pity in the tremulous lines of her sweet mouth it was charming to see how sorry she felt for meand it was odd that i could not feel sorry for myself after a few words of embarrassed greeting i sat down and watched her silently while she arranged the logs in the fire to make them burn brighter and for the moment avoided my gaze i suppose you knowi began with harsh abruptnessthat the sleepingdraught story is a polite fiction you know that my wife poisoned herself intentionally mavis looked at me with a troubled and compassionate expression i feared it was so she began nervously oh there is nothing either to fear or to hopei said with some violenceshe did it and can you guess why she did it because she was mad with her own wickedness and sensualitybecause she loved with a guilty love my friend lucio rimnez mavis gave a little cry as of pain and sat down white and trembling you can read quickly i am surei went on part of the profession of literature is the ability to skim books and manuscripts rapidly and grasp the whole gist of them in a few minutesread this and i handed her the rolledup pages of sibyls dying declarationlet me stay here while you learn from that what sort of a woman she was and judge whether despite her beauty she is worth a regret pardon me said mavis gentlyi would rather not read what was not meant for my eyes but it is meant for your eyesi retorted impatientlyit is meant for everybodys eyes apparentlyit is addressed to nobody in particular there is a mention of you in it i begnay i command you to read iti want your opinion on ityour advice you may possibly suggest after perusal the proper sort of epitaph i ought to inscribe on the monument i am going to build to her sacred and dear memory i covered my face with one hand to hide the bitter smile which i knew betrayed my thoughts and pushed the manuscript towards her very reluctantly she took itand slowly unrolling it began to read for several minutes there was a silence broken only by the crackling of the logs on the fire and the regular breathing of the dogs who now both lay stretched comfortably in front of the wood blaze i looked covertly at the woman whose fame i had enviedat the slight figure the coronal of soft hairthe delicate drooping sensitive facethe small white classic hand that held the written sheets of paper so firmly yet so tenderlythe very hand of the greek marble psycheand i thought what shortsighted asses some literary men are who suppose they can succeed in shutting out women like mavis clare from winning everything that fame or fortune can offer such a head as hers albeit covered with locks fair and caressable was not meant in its fine shape and compactness for submission to inferior intelligences whether masculine or femininethat determined little chin which the firelight delicately outlined was a visible declaration of the strength of will and the indomitably high ambition of its ownerand yet the soft eyesthe tender mouthdid not these suggest the sweetest love the purest passion that ever found place in a womans heart i lost myself in dreamy musingi thought of many things that had little to do with either my own past or present i realized that now and then at rare intervals god makes a woman of genius with a thinkers brain and an angels souland that such an one is bound to be a destiny to all mortals less divinely endowed and a glory to the world in which she dwells so considering i studied mavis clares face and formi saw her eyes fill with tears as she read onwhy should she weep i wondered over that last document which had left me unmoved and callous i was startled almost as if from sleep when her voice thrilling with pain disturbed the stillnessshe sprang up gazing at me as if she saw some horrible vision oh are you so blind she cried as not to see what this means can you not understand do you not know your worst enemy my worst enemy i echoed amazedyou surprise me maviswhat have i or my enemies or friends to do with my wifes last confession she ravedbetween poison and passion she could not tell as you see by her final words whether she was dead or aliveand her writing at all under such stress of circumstances was a phenomenal effortbut it has nothing to do with me personally for gods sake do not be so hardheartedsaid mavis passionatelyto me these last words of sibylspoor tortured miserable girlare beyond all expression horrible and appalling do you mean to tell me you have no belief in a future life none i answered with conviction then this is nothing to youthis solemn assurance of hers that she is not dead but living againliving too in indescribable miseryyou do not believe it does anyone believe the ravings of the dying i answeredshe was as i have said suffering the torments of poison and passionand in those torments wrote as one tormented is it impossible to convince you of the truth asked mavis solemnlyare you so diseased in your spiritual perceptions as not to know beyond a doubt that this world is but the shadow of the other worlds awaiting us i assure you as i live you will have that terrible knowledge forced upon you some day i am aware of your theoriesyour wife had the same beliefs or rather nonbeliefs as yourselfyet she has been convinced at last i shall not attempt to </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> to argue with you if this last letter of the unhappy girl you wedded cannot open your eyes to the eternal facts you choose to ignore nothing will ever help you you are in the power of your enemy of whom are you speaking mavis i asked astonished observing that she stood like one suddenly appalled in a dream her eyes fixed musingly on vacancy and her lips trembling apart your enemyyour enemy she repeated with energyit seems to me as if his shadow stood near you now listen to this voice from the deadsibyls voicewhat does she sayoh god have mercyi know who claims my worship now and drags me into yonder rolling world of flame his name is well i interrupted eagerlyshe breaks off there his name is lucio rimnez said mavis in a thrilling tonei do not know from whence he camebut i take god to witness my belief that he is a worker of evila fiend in beautiful human shapea destroyer and a corrupter the curse of him fell on sibyl the moment she met himthe same curse rests on you leave him if you are wisetake your chance of escape while it remains to youand never let him see your face again she spoke with a kind of breathless haste as though impelled by a force not her owni stared at her amazed and in a manner irritated such a course of action would be impossible to me mavisi said somewhat coldlythe prince rimnez is my best friendno man ever had a betterand his loyalty to me has been put to a severe test under which most men would have failed i have not told you all and i related in a few words the scene i had witnessed between my wife and lucio in the musicgallery at willowsmere she listenedbut with an evident effortand pushing back her clustering hair from her brows she sighed heavily i am sorrybut it does not alter my convictionshe saidi look upon your best friend as your worst foe and i feel you do not realize the awful calamity of your wifes death in its true aspect will you forgive me if i ask you to leave me nowlady sibyls letter has affected me terriblyi feel i cannot speak about it any more i wish i had not read it she broke off with a little halfsuppressed sobi saw she was unnerved and taking the manuscript from her hand i said halfbanteringly you cannot then suggest an epitaph for my wifes monument she turned upon me with a grand gesture of reproach yes i canshe replied in a low indignant voiceinscribe it asfrom a pitiless hand to a broken heart that will suit the dead girland you the living man her rustling gown swept across my feetshe passed me and was gone stupefied by her sudden anger and equally sudden departure i stood inertthe st bernard rose from the hearthrug and glowered at me suspiciously evidently wishing me to take my leavepallas athene stared as usual through me and beyond me in a boundless scornall the various objects in this quiet study seemed silently to eject me as an undesired occupant i looked round it once longingly as a tired outcast may look on a peaceful garden and wish in vain to enter how like her sex she is after all i said half aloudshe blames me for being pitilessand forgets that sibyl was the sinnernot i no matter how guilty a woman may be she generally manages to secure a certain amount of sympathya man is always left out in the cold a shuddering sense of loneliness oppressed me as my eyes wandered round the restful room the odour of lilies was in the air exhaled so i fancied from the delicate and dainty personality of mavis herself if i had only known her firstand loved her i murmured as i turned away at last and left the house but then i remembered i had hated her before i ever met herand not only had i hated her but i had vilified and misrepresented her work with a scurrilous pen under the shield of anonymity and out of sheer malicethus giving her in the public sight the greatest proof of her own genius a gifted woman can ever winmans envy xxxviii two weeks later i stood on the deck of lucios yacht the flamea vessel whose complete magnificence filled me as well as all other beholders with bewildered wonderment and admiration she was a miracle of speed her motive power being electricity and the electric engines with which she was fitted were so complex and remarkable as to baffle all wouldbe inquirers into the secret of their mechanism and potency a large crowd of spectators gathered to see her as she lay off southampton attracted by the beauty of her shape and appearancesome bolder spirits even came out in tugs and rowboats hoping to be allowed to make a visit of inspection on board but the sailors powerfullybuilt men of a foreign and somewhat unpleasing type soon intimated that the company of such inquisitive persons was undesirable and unwelcome with white sails spread and a crimson flag flying from her mast she weighed anchor at sunset on the afternoon of the day her owner and i joined her and moving through the waters with delicious noiselessness and incredible rapidity soon left far behind her the english shore looking like a white line in the mist or the pale vision of a land that might once have been i had done a few quixotic things before departing from my native countryfor example i had made a free gift of his former home willowsmere to lord elton taking a sort of sullen pleasure in thinking that he the spendthrift nobleman owed the restoration of his property to meto me who had never been either a successful linendraper or furnitureman but simply an author one of those sort of people whom my lord and my lady imagine they can patronize and neglect again at pleasure without danger to themselves the arrogant fools invariably forget what lasting vengeance can be taken for an unmerited slight by the owner of a brilliant pen i was glad too in a way to realize that the daughter of the american railwayking would be brought to the grand old house to air her countessship and look at her prettily pert little physiognomy in the very mirror where sibyl had watched herself die i do not know why this idea pleased me for i bore no grudge against diana chesneyshe was vulgar but harmless and would probably make a much more popular chtelaine at willowsmere court than my wife had ever been among other things i dismissed my man morris and made him miserablewith the gift of a thousand pounds to marry and start a business on he was miserable because he could not make up his mind what business to adopt his anxiety being to choose the calling that would pay bestand also because though he had his eye upon several young women he could not tell which among them would be likely to be least extravagant and the most serviceable as a cook and housekeeper the love of money and the pains of taking care of it embittered his days as it embitters the days of most men and my unexpected munificence towards him burdened him with such a weight of trouble as robbed him of natural sleep and appetite i cared nothing for his perplexities however and gave him no advice good or bad my other servants i dismissed each with a considerable gift of money not that i particularly wished to benefit them but simply because i desired them to speak well of me and in this world it is very evident that the only way to get a good opinion is to pay for it i gave orders to a famous italian sculptor for sibyls monument english sculptors having no conception of sculptureit was to be of exquisite design wrought in purest white marble the chief adornment being the centrefigure of an angel ready for flight with the face of sibyl faithfully copied from her picture because however devilish a woman may be in her lifetime one is bound by all the laws of social hypocrisy to make an angel of her as soon as she is dead just before i left london i heard that my old collegefriend boffles john carrington had met with a sudden end busy at the retorting of his gold he had been choked by the mercurial fumes and had died in hideous torment at one time this news would have deeply affected me but now i was scarcely sorry i had heard nothing of him since i had come into my fortunehe had never even written to congratulate me always full of my own selfimportance i judged this as great neglect on his part and now that he was dead i felt no more than any of us feel nowadays at the loss of friends and that is very littlewe have really no time to be sorryso many people are always dyingand we are in such a desperate hurry to rush on to death ourselves nothing seemed to touch me that did not closely concern my own personal interestand i had no affections left unless i may </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> may call the vague tenderness i had for mavis clare an affection yet to be honest this very emotion was after all nothing but a desire to be consoled pitied and loved by herto be able to turn upon the world and say this woman whom you have lifted on your shield of honour and crowned with laurelsshe loves meshe is not yours but mine purely interested and purely selfish was the longingand it deserved no other name than selfishness my feelings for rimnez too began at this time to undergo a curious change the fascination i had for him the power he exercised over me remained as great as ever but i found myself often absorbed in a close study of him strangely against my own will sometimes his every look seemed fraught with meaninghis every gesture suggestive of an almost terrific authority he was always to me the most attractive of beingsnevertheless there was an uneasy sensation of doubt and fear growing up in my mind regarding hima painful anxiety to know more about him than he had ever told meand on rare occasions i experienced a sudden shock of inexplicable repulsion against him which like a tremendous wave threw me back with violence upon myself and left me halfstunned with a dread of i knew not what alone with him as it were on the wide sea cut off for a time from all other intercourse than that which we shared together these sensations were very strong upon me i began to note many things which i had been too blind or too absorbed in my own pursuits to observe before the offensive presence of amiel who acted as chief steward on board the yacht filled me now not only with dislike but nervous apprehensionthe dark and more or less repulsive visages of the crew haunted me in my dreamsand one day leaning over the vessels edge and gazing blankly down into the fathomless water below i fell to thinking of strange sorceries of the east and stories of magicians who by the exercise of unlawful science did so make victims of men and delude them that their wills were entirely perverted and no longer their own i do not know why this passing thought should have suddenly overwhelmed me with deep depressionbut when i looked up to me the sky had grown dark and the face of one of the sailors who was near me polishing the brass handrail seemed singularly threatening and sinister i moved to go to the other side of the deck when a hand was gently laid on my shoulder from behind and turning i met the sad and splendid eyes of lucio are you growing weary of the voyage geoffrey he askedweary of those two suggestions of eternitythe interminable sky the interminable sea i am afraid you areman easily gets fatigued with his own littleness and powerlessness when he is set afloat on a plank between air and ocean yet we are travelling as swiftly as electricity will bear usand as worked in this vessel it is carrying us at a far greater speed than you perhaps realize or imagine i made no immediate answer but taking his arm strolled slowly up and down i felt he was looking at me but i avoided meeting his gaze you have been thinking of your wife he queried softly and as i thought sympatheticallyi have shunnedfor reasons you know ofall allusion to the tragic end of so beautiful a creature beauty is alasso often subject to hysteria yetif you had any faith you would believe she is an angel now i stopped short at this and looked straight at him there was a fine smile on his delicate mouth an angel i repeated slowlyor a devil which would you say she isyou who sometimes declare that you believe in heavenand hell he was silent but the dreamy smile remained still on his lips come speak i said roughlyyou can be frank with me you knowangel or devilwhich my dear geoffrey he remonstrated gently and with gravitya woman is always an angelboth here and hereafter i laughed bitterly if that is part of your faith i am sorry for you i have not spoken of my faithhe rejoined in colder accents lifting his brilliant eyes to the darkening heaveni am not a salvationist that i should bray forth a creed to the sound of trump and drum all the same you have a creedi persistedand i fancy it must be a strange one if you remember you promised to explain it to me are you ready to receive such an explanation he asked in a somewhat ironical toneno my dear friendpermit me to say you are not readynot yet my beliefs are too positive to be brought even into contact with your contradictionstoo frightfully real to submit to your doubts for a moment you would at once begin to revert to the puny usedup old arguments of voltaire schopenhauer and huxleylittle atomic theories like grains of dust in the whirlwind of my knowledge i can tell you i believe in god as a very actual and positive beingand that is presumably the first of the church articles you believe in god i echoed his words staring at him stupidly he seemed in earnest in fact he had always seemed in earnest on the subject of deity vaguely i thought of a woman in society whom i slightly knewan ugly woman unattractive and meanminded who passed her time in entertaining semiroyalties and pushing herself amongst themshe had said to me one day4 i hate people who believe in god dont you the idea of a god makes me sick you believe in god i repeated again dubiously look he said raising his hand towards the skythere a few drifting clouds cover millions of worlds impenetrable mysterious yet actualdown there and he pointed to the sea lurk a thousand things of which though the ocean is a part of earth human beings have not yet learned the nature between these upper and lower spaces of the incomprehensible yet absolute you a finite atom of limited capabilities stand uncertain how long the frail thread of your life shall last yet arrogantly balancing the question with your own poor brain as to whether youyou in your utter littleness and incompetency shall condescend to accept a god or not i confess that of all astonishing things in the universe this particular attitude of modern mankind is the most astonishing to me your own attitude is the reluctant acceptance of such terrific knowledge as is forced upon me he replied with a dark smilei do not say i have been an apt or a willing pupili have had to suffer in learning what i know do you believe in hell i asked him suddenlyand in satan the archenemy of mankind he was silent for so long that i was surprised the more so as he grew pale to the lips and a curious almost deathlike rigidity of feature gave his expression something of the ghastly and terrible after a pause he turned his eyes upon mean intense burning misery was reflected in them though he smiled most assuredly i believe in hell how can i do otherwise if i believe in heaven if there is an up there must be a down if there is light there must also be darkness and concerning the archenemy of mankindif half the stories reported of him be true he must be the most piteous and pitiable figure in the universe what would be the sorrows of a thousand million worlds compared to the sorrows of satan sorrows i echoedhe is supposed to rejoice in the working of evil neither angel nor devil can do thathe said slowlyto rejoice in the working of evil is a temporary mania which affects man only for actual joy to come out of evil chaos must come again and god must extinguish himself he stared across the dark seathe sun had sunk and one faint star twinkled through the clouds and so i again saythe sorrows of satan sorrows immeasurable as eternity itselfimagine them to be shut out of heavento hear all through the unending ons the faroff voices of angels whom once he knew and lovedto be a wanderer among deserts of darkness and to pine for the light celestial that was formerly as air and food to his beingand to know that mans folly mans utter selfishness mans cruelty keep him thus exiled an outcast from pardon and peace mans nobleness may lift the lost spirit almost within reach of his lost joysbut mans vileness drags him down againeasy was the torture of sisyphus compared with the torture of satan no wonder that he loathes mankindsmall blame to him if he seeks to destroy the puny tribe eternallylittle marvel that he grudges them their share of immortality think of it as a legend merelyand he turned upon me with a movement that was almost fiercechrist redeemed manand by his teaching showed how it was possible for man to redeem the devil i do not understand you i said feebly awed by the strange pain and passion of his tone do you not yet my meaning is scarcely obscure if men were true to their immortal instincts and to the god that made themif they were generous honest </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> honest fearless faithful reverent unselfish if women were pure brave tender and lovingcan you not imagine that in the strong force and fairness of such a world lucifer son of the morning would be moved to love instead of hatethat the closed doors of paradise would be unbarredand that he lifted towards his creator on the prayers of pure lives would wear again his angels crown can you not realize this even by way of a legendary story why yes as a legendary story the idea is beautifuli admittedand to me as i told you once before quite new still as men are never likely to be honest or women pure im afraid the poor devil stands a bad chance of ever getting redeemed i fear so too and he eyed me with a curious derisioni very much fear so and his chances being so slight i rather respect him for being the archenemy of such a worthless race he paused a moment then addedi wonder how we have managed to get on such an absurd subject of conversation it is dull and uninteresting as all spiritual themes invariably are my object in bringing you out on this voyage is not to indulge in psychological argument but to make you forget your troubles as much as possible and enjoy the present while it lasts there was a vibration of compassionate kindness in his voice which at once moved me to an acute sense of selfpity the worst enervator of moral force that exists i sighed heavily truly i have sufferedi saidmore than most men more even than most millionaires deserve to suffer declared lucio with that inevitable touch of sarcasm which distinguished some of his friendliest remarksmoney is supposed to make amends to a man for everythingand even the wealthy wife of a certain irish patriot has not found it incompatible with affection to hold her moneybags close to herself while her husband has been declared a bankrupt how she has idolized him let others say now considering your cashabundance it must be owned the fates have treated you somewhat unkindly the smile that was halfcruel and halfsweet radiated in his eyes as he spokeand again a singular revulsion of feeling against him moved me to dislike and fear and yethow fascinating was his company i could not but admit that the voyage with him to alexandria on board the flame was one of positive enchantment and luxury all the way there was nothing in a material sense left to wish forall that could appeal to the intelligence or the imagination had been thought of on board this wonderful yacht which sped like a fairy ship over the sea some of the sailors were skilled musicians and on tranquil nights or at sunset would bring stringed instruments and discourse to our ears the most dulcet and ravishing melodies lucio himself too would often singhis luscious voice resounding as it seemed over all the visible sea and sky with such passion as might have drawn an angel down to listen gradually my mind became impregnated with these snatches of mournful fierce or weird minor tunesand i began to suffer in silence from an inexplicable depression and foreboding sense of misery as well as from another terrible feeling to which i could scarcely give a namea dreadful uncertainty of myself as of one lost in a wilderness and about to die i endured these fits of mental agony aloneand in such dreary burning moments believed i was going mad i grew more and more sullen and taciturn and when we at last arrived at alexandria i was not moved to any particular pleasure the place was new to me but i was not conscious of noveltyeverything seemed flat dull and totally uninteresting a heavy almost lethargic stupor chained my wits and when we left the yacht in harbour and went on to cairo i was not sensible of any personal enjoyment in the journey or interest in what i saw i was only partially roused when we took possession of a luxurious dahabeah which with a retinue of attendants had been specially chartered for us and commenced our lotuslike voyage up the nile the reededged sluggish yellow river fascinated mei used to spend long hours reclining at full length in a deckchair gazing at the flat shores the blown sandheaps the broken columns and mutilated temples of the dead kingdoms of the past one evening thus musing while the great golden moon climbed languidly up into the sky to stare at the wrecks of earthly ages i said if one could only see these ancient cities as they once existed what strange revelations might be made our modern marvels of civilization and progress might seem small trifles after allfor i believe in our days we are only rediscovering what the peoples of old time knew lucio drew his cigar from his mouth and looked at it meditatively then he glanced up at me with a halfsmile would you like to see a city resuscitated he inquiredhere in this very spot some six thousand years ago a king reigned with a woman not his queen but his favourite quite a lawful arrangement in those days who was as famous for her beauty and virtue as this river is for its fructifying tide here civilization had progressed enormouslywith the one exception that it had not outgrown faith modern france and england have beaten the ancients in their scorn of god and creed their contempt for divine things their unnameable lasciviousness and blasphemy this cityand he waved his hand towards a dreary stretch of shore where a cluster of tall reeds waved above the monster fragment of a fallen columnwas governed by the strong pure faith of its people more than anythingand the ruler of social things in it was a woman the kings favourite was something like mavis clare in that she possessed geniusshe had also the qualities of justice intelligence love truth and a most noble unselfishnessshe made this place happy it was a paradise on earth while she livedwhen she died its glory ended so much can a woman do if she choosesso much does she not do in her usual cowlike way of living how do you know all this you tell me of i asked him by study of past recordshe repliedi read what modern men declare they have no time to read you are right in the idea that all new things are only old things reinvented or rediscoveredif you had gone a step further and said that some of mens present lives are only the continuation of their past you would not have been wrong now if you like i can by my science show you the city that stood here long agothe city beautiful as its name is translated from the ancient tongue i roused myself from my lounging attitude and looked at him amazedly he met my gaze unmoved you can show it to me i exclaimedhow can you do such an impossible thing permit me to hypnotize youhe answered smilingmy system of hypnotism is very fortunately not yet discovered by meddlesome inquirers into occult mattersbut it never fails of its effectand i promise you you shall under my influence see not only the place but the people my curiosity was strongly excited and i became more eager to try the suggested experiment than i cared to openly show i laughed however with affected indifference i am perfectly willing i saidall the same i dont think you can hypnotize mei have much too strong a will of my own at which remark i saw a smile dark and saturnine hover on his lipsbut you can make the attempt he rose at once and signed to one of our egyptian servants stop the dahabeah azimah he saidwe will rest here for the night azimah a superblooking eastern in picturesque white garments put his hands to his head in submission and retired to give the order in another few moments the dahabeah had stopped a great silence was around usthe moonlight fell like yellow wine on the deckin the far distance across the stretches of dark sand a solitary column towered so clearcut against the sky that it was almost possible to discern upon it the outline of a monstrous face lucio stood still confronting mesaying nothing but looking me steadily through and through with those wonderful mystic melancholy eyes that seemed to penetrate and burn my very flesh i was attracted as a bird might be by the basilisk eyes of a snakeyet i tried to smile and say something indifferent my efforts were uselesspersonal consciousness was slipping from me fastthe sky the water and the moon whirled round each other in a giddy chase for precedencei could not move for my limbs seemed fastened to my chair with weights of iron and i was for a few minutes absolutely powerless then suddenly my vision cleared as i thoughtmy senses grew vigorous and alert i heard the sound of solemn marching music and therethere in the full radiance of the moon with a thousand lights gleaming forth from high cupolas shone the city beautiful 4 said in the authors hearing by one of the lady leaders of smart society xxxix a vision of majestic buildings vast stately and giganticof streets crowded with men and women in white and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> and coloured garments adorned with jewelsof flowers that grew on the roofs of palaces and swung from terrace to terrace in loops and garlands of fantastic bloomof trees broadbranched and fully leafedof marble embankments overlooking the riverof lotuslilies growing thickly below by the waters edgeof music that echoed in silver and brazen twangings from the shelter of shady gardens and covered balconiesevery beautiful detail rose before me more distinctly than an ivory carving mounted on an ebony shield just opposite where i stood or seemed to stand on the deck of a vessel in the busy harbour a wide avenue extended opening up into huge squares embellished with strange figures of granite gods and animalsi saw the sparkling spray of many fountains in the moonlight and heard the low persistent hum of the restless human multitudes that thronged the place as thickly as bees clustered in a hive to the left of the scene i could discern a huge bronze gate guarded by sphinxes there was a garden beyond it and from that depth of shade a girls voice singing a strange wild melody came floating towards me on the breeze meanwhile the marching music i had first of all caught the echo of sounded nearer and nearerand presently i perceived a great crowd approaching with lighted torches and garlands of flowers soon i saw a band of priests in brilliant robes that literally blazed with sunlike gemsthey were moving towards the river and with them came young boys and little children while on either side maidens whiteveiled and rosewreathed paced demurely swinging silver censers to and fro after the priestly procession walked a regal figure between ranks of slaves and attendantsi knew it for the king of this city beautiful and was almost moved to join in the thundering acclamations which greeted his progress and that snowy palanquin carried by lilycrowned girls that followed his trainwho occupied it what gem of his land was thus tenderly enshrined i was consumed by an extraordinary longing to know thisi watched the white burden coming nearer to my point of vantagei saw the priests arrange themselves in a semicircle on the riverembankment the king in their midst and the surging shouting multitude aroundthen came the brazen clangour of many bells intermixed with the rolling of drums and the shrilling sound of reedpipes lightly blown uponand amid the blaze of the flaring torches the white palanquin was set down upon the ground a woman clad in some silvery glistening tissue stepped forth from it like a sylph from the foam of the sea butshe was veiledi could not discern so much as the outline of her featuresand the keen disappointment of this was a positive torture to me if i could but see her i thought i should know something i had never hitherto guessed lift oh lift the shrouding veil spirit of the city beautiful i inwardly prayedfor i feel i shall read in your eyes the secret of happiness but the veil was not withdrawn the music made barbaric clamour in my ears the blaze of strong light and colour blinded me and i felt myself reeling into a dark chaos where as i imagined i chased the moon as she flew before me on silver wingsthen the sound of a rich baritone trolling out a light song from a familiar modern opera bouffe confused and startled meand in another second i found myself staring wildly at lucio who lying easily back in his deckchair was carolling joyously to the silent night and the blank expanse of sandy shore in front of which our dahabeah rested motionless with a cry i flung myself upon him where is she i exclaimedwho is she he looked at me without replying and smiling quizzically released himself from my sudden grasp i drew back shuddering and bewildered i saw it all i murmuredthe citythe prieststhe peoplethe kingall but her face why was that hidden from me and actual tears rose to my eyes involuntarilylucio surveyed me with evident amusement what a find you would be to a firstclass spiritual impostor playing his tricks in cultured and easilygulled london society he observedyou seem most powerfully impressed by a passing vision do you mean to tell me i said earnestly that what i saw just now was the mere thought of your brain conveyed to mine precisely he respondedi know what the city beautiful was like and i was able to draw it for you on the canvas of my memory and present it as a complete picture to your inward sight for you have an inward sightthough like most people you live unconscious of that neglected faculty butwho was she i repeated obstinately she was i presume the kings favourite if she kept her face hidden from you as you complain i am sorrybut i assure you it was not my fault get to bed geoffreyyou look dazed you take visions badlyyet they are better than realities believe me somehow i could not answer him i left him abruptly and went below to try and sleep but my thoughts were all cruelly confused and i began to be more than ever overwhelmed with a sense of deepening terrora feeling that i was being commanded controlled and as it were driven along by a force that had in it something unearthly it was a most distressing sensationit made me shrink at times from the look of lucios eyesnow and then indeed i almost cowered before him so increasingly great was the indefinable dread i had of his presence it was not so much the strange vision of the city beautiful that had inspired this in mefor after all that was only a trick of hypnotism as he had said and as i was content to argue it with myselfbut it was his whole manner that suddenly began to impress me as it had never impressed me before if any change was slowly taking place in my sentiments towards him so surely it seemed was he changing equally towards me his imperious ways were more imperialhis sarcasm more sarcastichis contempt for mankind more openly displayed and more frequently pronounced yet i admired him as much as everi delighted in his conversation whether it were witty philosophical or cynicali could not imagine myself without his company nevertheless the gloom on my mind deepenedour nile trip became infinitely wearisome to me so much so that almost before we had got halfway on our journey up the river i longed to turn back again and wished the voyage at an end an incident that occurred at luxor was more than sufficient to strengthen this desire we had stayed there for several days exploring the district and visiting the ruins of thebes and karnac where they were busy excavating tombs one afternoon they brought to light a red granite sarcophagus intactin it was a richly painted coffin which was opened in our presence and was found to contain the elaborately adorned mummy of a woman lucio proved himself an apt reader of hieroglyphs and he translated in brief and with glib accuracy the history of the corpse as it was pictured inside the sepulchral shell a dancer at the court of queen amenartes he announced for the benefit of several interested spectators who with myself stood round the sarcophaguswho because of her many sins and secret guilt which made her life unbearable and her days full of corruption died of poison administered by her own hand according to the kings command and in presence of the executioners of law such is the ladys storycondensedthere are a good many other details of course she appears to have been only in her twentieth year well and he smiled as he looked round upon his little audiencewe may congratulate ourselves on having progressed since the days of these overstrict ancient egyptians the sins of dancers are not with us taken au grand serieux shall we see what she is like no objection was raised by the authorities concerned in the discoveriesand i who had never witnessed the unrolling of a mummy before watched the process with great interest and curiosity as one by one of the scented wrappings were removed a long tress of nutbrown hair became visiblethen those who were engaged in the task used more extreme and delicate precaution lucio himself assisting them to uncover the face as this was done a kind of sick horror stole over mebrown and stiff as parchment though the features were their contour was recognisableand when the whole countenance was exposed to view i could almost have shrieked aloud the name of sibyl for it was like herdreadfully likeand as the faint halfaromatic halfputrid odours of the unrolled cerements crept towards me on the air i reeled back giddily and covered my eyes irresistibly i was reminded of the subtle french perfume exhaled from sibyls garments when i found her deadthat and this sickly effluvia were similar a man standing near me saw me swerve as though about to fall and caught me on his arm the sun is too strong for you i fear he said kindlythis climate does not suit everybody i forced a smile and murmured something about a passing touch of vertigothen recovering myself i gazed fearfully at lucio who was studying the mummy attentively with a curious smile presently stooping over the coffin </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> coffin he took out of it a piece of finely wrought gold in the shape of a medallion this i imagine must be the fair dancers portraithe said holding it up to the view of all the eager and exclaiming spectatorsquite a treasuretrove an admirable piece of ancient workmanship besides being the picture of a very lovely woman do you not think so geoffrey he handed me the medallionand i examined it with deadly and fascinated interestthe face was exquisitely beautifulbut assuredly it was the face of sibyl i never remember how i lived through the rest of that day at night as soon as i had an opportunity of speaking to rimnez alone i asked him did you seedid you not recognize that the dead egyptian dancer resembled your late wife he quietly continuedyesi noticed it at once but that should not affect you history repeats itselfwhy should not lovely women repeat themselves beauty always has its double somewhere either in the past or future i said no morebut next morning i was very illso ill that i could not rise from my bed and passed the hours in restless moaning and irritable pain that was not so much physical as mental there was a physician resident at the hotel at luxor and lucio always showing himself particularly considerate for my personal comfort sent for him at once he felt my pulse shook his head and after much dubious pondering advised my leaving egypt immediately i heard his mandate given with a joy i could scarcely conceal the yearning i had to get quickly away from this land of the old gods was intense and feverishi loathed the vast and awful desert silences where the sphinx frowns contempt on the puny littleness of mankindwhere the opened tombs and coffins expose once more to the light of day faces that are the very semblances of those we ourselves have known and loved in our timeand where painted history tells us of just such things as our modern newspapers chronicle albeit in different form rimnez was ready and willing to carry out the doctors ordersand arranged our return to cairo and from thence to alexandria with such expedition as left me nothing to desire and filled me with gratitude for his apparent sympathy in as short a time as abundance of cash could make possible we had rejoined the flame and were en route as i thought for france or england we had not absolutely settled our destination having some idea of coasting along the rivierabut my old confidence in rimnez being now almost restored i left this to him for decision sufficiently satisfied in myself that i had not been destined to leave my bones in terrorhaunted egypt and it was not till i had been about a week or ten days on board and had made good progress in the recovery of my health that the beginning of the end of this nevertobeforgotten voyage was foreshadowed to me in such terrific fashion as nearly plunged me into the darkness of deathor rather let me now say having learned my bitter lesson thoroughly into the fell brilliancy of that life beyond the tomb which we refuse to recognise or realize till we are whirled into its glorious or awful vortex one evening after a bright day of swift and enjoyable sailing over a smooth and sunlit sea i retired to rest in my cabin feeling almost happy my mind was perfectly tranquilmy trust in my friend lucio was again reestablishedand i may add so was my old arrogant and confident trust in myself my access to fortune had not so far brought me either much joy or distinctionbut it was not too late for me yet to pluck the golden apples of hesperides the various troubles i had endured though of such recent occurrence began to assume a blurred indistinctness in my mind as of things long past and done withi considered the strength of my financial position again with satisfaction to the extent of contemplating a second marriageand that marriage withmavis clare no other woman should be my wife i mentally sworeshe and she only should be mine i foresaw no difficulties in the wayand full of pleasant dreams and selfdelusions i settled myself in my berth and dropped easily off to sleep about midnight i awoke vaguely terrified to see the cabin full of a strong red light and fierce glare my first dazed impression was that the yacht was on firethe next instant i became paralysed and dumb with horror sibyl stood before me sibyl a wild strange tortured writhing figure half nude waving beckoning arms and making desperate gesturesher face was as i had seen it last in death livid and hideous her eyes blazed mingled menace despair and warning upon me round her a living wreath of flame coiled upwards like a twisted snake her lips moved as though she strove to speak but no sound came from themand while i yet looked at her she vanished i must have lost consciousness thenfor when i awoke it was broad day but this ghastly visitation was only the first of many suchand at last every night i saw her thus sheeted in flame till i grew wellnigh mad with fear and misery my torment was indescribableyet i said nothing to lucio who watched me as i imagined narrowlyi took sleepingdraughts in the hope to procure unbroken rest but in vainalways i woke at one particular moment and always i had to face this fiery phantom of my dead wife with despair in her eyes and an unuttered warning on her lips this was not all one day in the full sunlight of a quiet afternoon i entered the saloon of the yacht alone and started back amazed to see my old friend john carrington seated at the table pen in hand casting up accounts he bent over his papers closelyhis face was furrowed and very palebut so lifelike was he so seemingly substantial that i called him by name whereat he looked upsmiled drearily and was gone trembling in every limb i realized that here was another spectral terror added to the burden of my days and sitting down i tried to rally my scattered forces and reason out what was best to be done there was no doubt i was very illthese phantoms were the warning of braindisease i must endeavour i thought to keep myself well under control till i got to englandthere i determined to consult the best physicians and put myself under their care till i was thoroughly restored meanwhilei muttered to myselfi will say nothing not even to lucio he would only smile and i should hate him i broke off wondering at this for was it possible i should ever hate him surely not that night by way of a change i slept in a hammock on deck hoping to dispel midnight illusions by resting in the open air but my sufferings were only intensified i woke as usual to see not only sibyl but also to my deadly fear the three phantoms that had appeared to me in my room in london on the evening of viscount lyntons suicide there they werethe same the very sameonly this time all their livid faces were lifted and turned towards me and though their lips never moved the word misery seemed uttered for i heard it tolling like a funeral bell on the air and across the sea and sibyl with her face of death in the coils of a silent flame sibyl smiled at mea smile of torture and remorse godi could endure it no longer leaping from my hammock i ran towards the vessels edge one plunge into the cool waves hathere stood amiel with his impenetrable dark face and ferret eyes can i assist you sir he inquired deferentially i stared at himthen burst into a laugh assist me why noyou can do nothing i want rest and i cannot sleep here the air is too close and sulphureousthe very stars are burning hot i pausedhe regarded me with his usual gravely derisive expression i am going down to my cabini continued trying to speak more calmlyi shall be alone there perhaps again i laughed wildly and involuntarily and staggered away from him down the deckstairs afraid to look back lest i should see those three figures of fate following me once safe in my cabin i shut to the door violently and in feverish haste seized my case of pistols i took out one and loaded it my heart was beating furiouslyi kept my eyes fixed on the ground lest they should encounter the dead eyes of sibyl one click of the trigger i whisperedand all is over i shall be at peacesenselesssightless and painless horrors can no longer haunt me i shall sleep i raised the weapon steadily to my right temple when suddenly my cabindoor opened and lucio looked in pardon me he said as he observed my attitudei had no idea you were busy i will go away i would not disturb you for the world his smile had something fiendish in its fine mockerymoved with a quick revulsion of feeling i turned the pistol downwards and held its muzzle firmly against the table near me you say that i exclaimed in acute anguishyou say itseeing </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> itseeing me thus i thought you were my friend he looked full at me his eyes grew large and luminous with a splendour of scorn passion and sorrow intermingled did you and again the terrific smile lit up his pale featuresyou were mistaken i am your enemy a dreadful silence followed something lurid and unearthly in his expression appalled me i trembled and grew cold with fear mechanically i replaced the pistol in its casethen i gazed up at him with a vacant wonder and wild piteousness seeing that his dark and frowning figure seemed to increase in stature towering above me like the gigantic shadow of a stormcloud my blood froze with an unnameable sickening terror then thick darkness veiled my sight and i dropped down senseless xl thunder and wild tumultthe glare of lightningthe shattering roar of great waves leaping mountains high and hissing asunder in midairto this fierce riot of savage elements let loose in a whirling boisterous dance of death i woke at last with a convulsive shock staggering to my feet i stood in the black obscurity of my cabin trying to rally my scattered forcesthe electric lamps were extinguished and the lightning alone illumined the sepulchral darkness frantic shoutings echoed above me on deckfiendlike yells that sounded now like triumph now like despair and again like menacethe yacht leaped to and fro like a hunted stag amid the furious billows and every frightful crash of thunder threatened as it seemed to split her in twain the wind howled like a devil in tormentit screamed and moaned and sobbed as though endowed with a sentient body that suffered acutest agonyanon it rushed downwards with an angry swoop as of wideflapping wings and at each raging gust i thought the vessel must surely founder forgetting everything but immediate personal danger i tried to open my door it was locked outsidei was a prisoner my indignation at this discovery exceeded every other feeling and beating with both hands on the wooden panels i called i shouted i threatened i sworeall in vain thrown down twice by the topsyturvey lurching of the yacht i still kept up a desperate hammering and calling striving to raise my voice above the distracting pandemonium of noise that seemed to possess the ship from end to end but all to no purposeand finally hoarse and exhausted i stopped and leaned against the unyielding door to recover breath and strength the storm appeared to be increasing in force and clamourthe lightning was wellnigh incessant and the clattering thunder followed each flash so instantaneously as to leave no doubt but that it was immediately above us i listenedand presently heard a frenzied cry breakers ahead this was followed by peals of discordant laughter terrified i strained my ears for every soundand all at once someone spoke to me quite closely as though the very darkness around me had found a tongue breakers ahead throughout the world storm and danger and doom doom and deathbut afterwardslife a certain intonation in these words filled me with such frantic horror that i fell on my knees in abject misery and almost prayed to the god i had through all my life disbelieved in and denied but i was too mad with fear to find wordsthe dense blacknessthe horrid uproar of the wind and seathe infuriated and confused shoutingall this was to my mind as though hell itself had broken loose and i could only kneel dumbly and tremble suddenly a swirling sound as of an approaching monstrous whirlwind made itself heard above all the rest of the dina sound that gradually resolved itself into a howling chorus of thousands of voices sweeping along on the gusty blastfierce cries were mingled with the jarring thunder and i leapt erect as i caught the words of the clangorous shout ave sathanas ave rigidly upright with limbs stiffening for sheer terror i stood listeningthe waves seemed to roar ave sathanasthe wind shrieked it to the thunderthe lightning wrote it in a snaky line of fire on the darkness ave sathanas my brain swam round and grew full to burstingi was going madraving mad surelyor why should i thus distinctly hear such unmeaning sounds as these with a sudden access of superhuman force i threw the whole weight of my body against the door of my cabin in a delirious effort to break it openit yielded slightlyand i prepared myself for another rush and similar attemptwhen all at once it was flung widely back admitting a stream of pale light and lucio wrapped in heavy shrouding garments confronted me follow me geoffrey tempest he said in low clear tonesyour time has come as he spoke all selfpossession deserted methe terrors of the storm and now the terror of his presence overwhelmed my strength and i stretched out my hands to him appealingly unknowing what i did or said for gods sake i began wildly he silenced me by an imperious gesture spare me your prayers for gods sake for your own sake and for mine follow he moved before me like a black phantom in the pale strange light surrounding himand i dazzled dazed and terrorstricken trod in his steps closely moved as it seemed by some volition not my own till i found myself alone with him in the saloon of the yacht with the waves hissing up against the windows like live snakes ready to sting trembling and scarcely able to stand i sank on a chairhe turned round and looked at me for a moment meditatively then he threw open one of the windowsa huge wave dashed in and scattered its bitter salt spray upon me where i satbut i heeded nothingmy agonised looks were fixed on himthe being i had so long made the companion of my days raising his hand with a gesture of authority he said back ye devils of the sea and windye which are not gods elements but my servants the unrepenting souls of men lost in the waves or whirled in the hurricane whichever ye have made your destiny get hence and cease your clamour this hour is mine panicstricken i heardaghast i saw the great billows that had shouldered up in myriads against the vessel sink suddenlythe yelling wind dropped silencedthe yacht glided along with a smooth even motion as though on a tranquil inland lakeand almost before i could realize it the light of the full moon beamed forth brilliantly and fell in a broad stream across the floor of the saloon but in the very cessation of the storm the words ave sathanas trembled as it were upwards to my ears from the underworld of the sea and died away in distance like a parting echo of thunder then lucio faced mewith what a countenance of sublime and awful beauty do you know me now man whom my millions of dross have made wretchedor do you need me to tell you who i am my lips movedbut i could not speak the dim and dreadful thought that was dawning on my mind seemed as yet too frenzied too outside the boundaries of material sense for mortal utterance be dumbbe motionlessbut hear and feel he continuedby the supreme power of godfor there is no other power in any world or any heaveni control and command you at this moment your own will being set aside for once as naught i choose you as one out of millions to learn in this life the lesson that all must learn hereafterlet every faculty of your intelligence be ready to receive that which i shall impartand teach it to your fellowmen if you have a conscience as you have a soul again i strove to speakhe seemed so humanso much my friend still though he had declared himself my enemyand yet what was that lambent radiance encircling his browsthat burning glory steadily deepening and flashing from his eyes you are one of the worlds fortunate men he went on surveying me straightly and pitilesslyso at least this world judges you because you can buy its goodwill but the forces that govern all worlds do not judge you by such a standardyou cannot buy their goodwill not though all the churches should offer to sell it you they regard you as you are stripped soulnakednot as you seem they behold in you a shameless egoist persistently engaged in defacing their divine image of immortalityand for that sin there is no excuse and no escape but punishment whosoever prefers self to god and in the arrogance of that self presumes to doubt and deny god invites another power to compass his destiniesthe power of evil made evil and kept evil by the disobedience and wickedness of man alonethat power whom mortals call satan prince of darknessbut whom once the angels knew as lucifer prince of light he broke offpausedand his flaming regard fell full upon me do you know me now i sat a rigid figure of fear dumbly staring was this man for he seemed man mad that he should thus hint at a thing too wild and terrible for speech if you do not know meif you do not feel in your convicted soul that you are aware of meit is because you will not know thus do i come upon men when they rejoice in their wilful selfblindness and vanitythus do i become </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> become their constant companion humouring them in such vices as they best lovethus do i take on the shape that pleases them and fit myself to their humours they make me what i amthey mould my very form to the fashion of their flitting time through all their changing and repeating eras they have found strange names and titles for meand their creeds and churches have made a monster of meas though imagination could compass any worse monster than the devil in man frozen and mute i heard the dead silence and his resonant voice vibrating through it seemed more terrific than the wildest storm yougods workendowed as every conscious atom of his creation is endowedwith the infinite germ of immortalityyou absorbed in the gathering together of such perishable trash as you conceive good for yourself on this planetyou dare in the puny reach of your mortal intelligence to dispute and question the everlasting things invisible you by the creators will are permitted to see the natural universebut in mercy to you the veil is drawn across the supernatural for such things as exist there would break your puny earthbrain as a frail shell is broken by a passing wheeland because you cannot see you doubt you doubt not only the surpassing love and wisdom that keeps you in ignorance till you shall be strong enough to bear full knowledge but you doubt the very fact of such another universe itself arrogant foolyour hours are counted by supernatural timeyour days are compassed by supernatural lawyour every thought word deed and look must go to make up the essence and shape of your being in supernatural life hereafterand what you have been in your soul here must and shall be the aspect of your soul there that law knows no changing the light about his face deepenedhe went on in clear accents that vibrated with the strangest music men make their own choice and form their own futures he saidand never let them dare to say they are not free to choose from the uttermost reaches of high heaven the spirit of god descended to them as manfrom the uttermost depths of lowest hell i the spirit of rebellion comeequally as man but the godinman was rejected and slaini the devilinman live on forever accepted and adored mans choice this isnot gods or

menand judge how little the powers of heaven can have to do with youhow much the powers of hell i shuddered involuntarilydimly i began to realize the awful nature of this unearthly interview you geoffrey tempest are a man in whom a thought of god was once implantedthat subtle fire or note of music out of heaven called genius so great a gift is rarely bestowed on any mortaland woe betide him who having received it holds it as of mere personal value to be used for self and not for god divine laws moved you gently in the right path of studythe path of suffering of disappointment of selfdenial and povertyfor only by these things is humanity made noble and trained in the ways of perfection through pain and enduring labour the soul is armed for battle and strengthened for conquest for it is more difficult to bear a victory well than to endure many buffetings of war but youyou resented heavens goodwill towards youthe valley of humiliation suited you not at all poverty maddened youstarvation sickened you yet poverty is better than arrogant wealthand starvation is healthier than selfindulgence you could not waityour own troubles seemed to you enormousyour own efforts laudable and marvellousthe troubles and efforts of others were nothing to youyou were ready to curse god and die compassionating yourself admiring yourself and none other with a heart full of bitterness and a mouth full of cursing you were eager to make quick havoc of both your genius and your soul for this cause your millions of money cameandso did i standing now full height he confronted mehis eyes were less brilliant but they reflected in their dark splendour a passionate scorn and sorrow o foolin my very coming i warned youon the very day we met i told you i was not what i seemed gods elements crashed a menace when we made our compact of friendship and iwhen i saw the faint last struggle of the not quite torpid soul in you to resist and distrust me did i not urge you to let that better instinct have its way youjester with the supernaturalyoubase scoffer at christ a thousand hints have been given youa thousand chances of doing such good as must have forced me to leave youas would have brought me a welcome respite from sorrowa moments cessation of torture his brows contracted in a sombre frownhe was silent a momentthen he resumed now learn from me the weaving of the web you so willingly became entangled in your millions of money were minethe man that left you heir to them was a wretched miser evil to the souls core by virtue of his own deeds he and his dross were mine and maddened by the sheer accumulation of worlds wealth he slew himself in a fit of frenzy he lives again in a new and much more realistic phase of existence and knows the actual value of mankinds cashpayments this you have yet to learn he advanced a step or two fixing his eyes more steadily upon me wealth is like geniusbestowed not for personal gratification but for the benefit of those who lack it what have you done for your fellowmen the very book you wrote and launched upon the tide of bribery and corruption was published with the intention to secure applause for yourself not to give help or comfort to others your marriage was prompted by lust and ambition and in the fair sensuality you wedded you got your deserts no love was in the unionit was sanctified by the blessing of fashion but not the blessing of god you have done without god so you think every act of your existence has been for the pleasure and advancement of yourselfand this is why i have chosen you out to hear and see what few mortals ever hear or see till they have passed the dividingline between this life and the next i have chosen you because you are a type of the apparently respected and unblamable manyou are not what the world calls a criminalyou have murdered nooneyou have stolen no neighbours goods your unchastities and adulteries are those of every fashionable vicemongerand your blasphemies against the divine are no worse than those of the most approved modern magazinecontributors you are guilty nevertheless of the chief crime of the agesensual egotismthe blackest sin known to either angels or devils because hopeless the murderer may repent and save a hundred lives to make up for the one he snatchedthe thief may atone with honest labourthe adulterer may scourge his flesh and do grim penance for late pardonthe blasphemer may retrieve his blasphemiesbut for the egoist there is no chance of wholesome penitence since to himself he is perfect and counts his creator as somewhat inferior this present time of the world breathes egotismthe taint of self the hideous worship of money corrodes all life all thought all feeling for vulgar cash the fairest and noblest scenes of nature are wantonly destroyed without public protest5the earth created in beauty is made hideousparents and children wives and husbands are ready to slay each other for a little goldheaven is barred

when the world is totally corruptwhen self is dominantwhen cunning supersedes honestywhen gold is mans chief ambitionwhen purity is condemnedwhen poets teach lewdness and scientists blasphemywhen love is mocked and god forgottenthe end is near i take my part in that endfor the souls of mankind are not done with when they leave their fleshly tenements when this planet is destroyed as a bubble broken in the air the souls of men and women live onas the soul of the woman you loved lives onas the soul of the mother who bore her lives onayeas all my worshippers live on through a myriad worlds a myriad phases till they learn to shape their destinies for heaven and i with them live on in many shapes in many wayswhen they return to god cleansed and perfect so shall i returnbut not till then he paused againand i heard a faint sighing sound everywhere as of wailing voices and the name ahrimanes was breathed suddenly upon the silence i started up listening every nerve strainedahrimanesor rimnez i gazed fearfully at him always beautiful his countenance was now sublime and his eyes shone with a lustrous flame you thought me friend he saidyou should have known me foe for everyone who flatters a man for his virtues or humours him in his vices is that mans worst enemy whether demon or angel but you judged me a fitting comradehence i was bound to </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> to serve youi and my followers with me you had no perception to realize thisyou supreme scorner of the supernatural little did you think of the terrifying agencies that worked the wonders of your betrothal feast at willowsmere little did you dream that fiends prepared the costly banquet and poured out the luscious wine at this a smothered groan of horror escaped mei looked wildly round me longing to find some deep grave of oblivious rest wherein to fall aye he continuedthe festival was fitted to the time of the world todaysociety gorging itself blind and senseless and attended by a retinue from hell my servants looked like menfor truly there is little difference twixt man and devil twas a brave gatheringengland has never seen so strange a one in all her annals the sighing wailing cries increased in loudnessmy limbs shook under me and all power of thought was paralysed in my brain he bent his piercing looks upon me with a new expression of infinite wonder pity and disdain what a grotesque creation you men have made of me he saidas grotesque as your conception of god with what trifling human attributes you have endowed me know you not that the changeless yet everchanging essence of immortal life can take a million million shapes and yet remain unalterably the same were i as hideous as your churches figure mecould the eternal beauty with which all angels are endowed ever change to such loathsomeness as haunts mankinds distorted imaginations perchance it would be wellfor none would make of me their comrade and none would cherish me as friend as fits each separate human nature so seems my imagefor thus is my fate and punishment commanded yet even in this mask of man i wear men own me their superiorthink you not that when the supreme spirit of god wore that same mask on earth men did not know him for their master yea they did knowand knowing murdered himas they ever strive to murder all divine things as soon as their divinity is recognised face to face i stood with him upon the mountaintop and there fulfilled my vow of temptation worlds and kingdoms supremacies and powerswhat were they to the ruler of them all get thee hence satan said the goldensounding voiceahglorious behesthappy respitefor i reached the very gate of heaven that night and heard the angels sing his accents sank to an infinitely mournful cadence what have your teachers done with me and my eternal sorrows he went onhave not they and the unthinking churches proclaimed a lie against me saying that i rejoice in evil o man to whom by gods will and because the worlds end draws nigh i unveil a portion of the mystery of my doom learn now once and for all that there is no possible joy in evilit is the despair and the discord of the universeit is mans creationmy tormentgods sorrow every sin of every human being adds weight to my torture and length to my doomyet my oath against the world must be kept i have sworn to temptto do my uttermost to destroy mankindbut man has not sworn to yield to my tempting he is freelet him resist and i departlet him accept me i remain eternal justice has spokenhumanity through the teaching of god made human must work out its own redemptionand mine here suddenly advancing he stretched out his handhis figure grew taller vaster and more majestic come with me now he said in a low penetrating voice that sounded sweet yet menacingcomefor the veil is down for you tonight you shall understand with whom you have dwelt so long in your shifting cloudcastle of lifeand in what company you have sailed perilous seasone who proud and rebellious like you errs less in that he owns god as his master at these words a thundering crash assailed my earsall the windows on either side of the saloon flew open and showed a strange glitter as of steely spears pointed aloft to the moon then halffainting i felt myself grasped and lifted suddenly and forcibly upwards and in another moment found myself on the deck of the flame held fast as a prisoner in the fierce grip of hands invisible raising my eyes in deadly despairprepared for hellish tortures and with a horrible sense of conviction in my soul that it was too late to cry out to god for mercyi saw around me a frozen worlda world that seemed as if the sun had never shone upon it thick glassygreen walls of ice pressed round the vessel on all sides and shut her in between their inflexible barriersfantastic palaces pinnacles towers bridges and arches of ice formed in their architectural outlines and groupings the semblance of a great cityover all the coldly glistening peaks the round moon emeraldpale looked downand standing opposite to me against the mast i beheld not lucio but an angel 5 witness the destruction of foyers to the historical shame and disgrace of scotland and scotsmen xli crowned with a mystic radiance as of trembling stars of fire that sublime figure towered between me and the moonlit sky the face austerely grand and beautiful shone forth luminously palethe eyes were full of unquenchable pain unspeakable remorse unimaginable despair the features i had known so long and seen day by day in familiar intercourse were the samethe same yet transfigured with ethereal splendour while shadowed by an everlasting sorrow bodily sensations i was scarcely conscious ofonly the soul of me hitherto dormant was awake and palpitating with fear gradually i became aware that others were around me and looking i saw a dense crowd of faces wild and wonderfulimploring eyes were turned upon me in piteous or stern agonyand pallid hands were stretched towards me more in appeal than menace and i beheld as i gazed the air darkening and anon lightening with the shadow and the brightness of wingsvast pinions of crimson flame began to unfurl and spread upwards all round the icebound vesselupwards till their glowing tips seemed wellnigh to touch the moon and he my foe who leaned against the mast became likewise encircled with these shafted pinions of burning rose which like finelywebbed clouds coloured by a strong sunset streamed outward flaringly from his dark form and sprang aloft in a blaze of scintillant glory and a voice infinitely sad yet infinitely sweet struck solemn music from the frozen silence steer onward amiel onward to the boundaries of the world with every spiritual sense aroused i glanced towards the steermans wheelwas that amiel whom i had instinctively loathedthat being stern as a figure of deadliest fate with sable wings and tortured countenance if so i knew him now for a fiend in very truthif burning horror and endless shame can so transfigure the soul of man a history of crime was written in his anguished looks what secret torment racked him no living mortal might dare to guess with pallid skeleton hands he moved the wheeland as it turned the walls of ice around us began to split with a noise of thunder onward amiel said the great sad voice againonward where never man hath trodsteer on to the worlds end the crowd of weird and terrible faces grew denserthe flaming and darkening of wings became thicker than driving stormclouds rent by lightningwailing cries groans and dreary sounds of sobbing echoed about me on all sides again the shattering ice roared like an earthquake under the waters and unhindered by her frozen prisonwalls the ship moved on dizzily and as one in a mad dream i saw the great glittering bergs rock and bend forwardthe massive icecity shook to its foundations glistening pinnacles dropped and vanished towers lurched over broke and plunged into the seahuge mountains of ice split up like fine glass yawning asunder with a green glare in the moonlight as the flame propelled so it seemed by the demonwings of her terrific crew cut through the frozen passage with the sharpness of a sword and the swiftness of an arrow whither were we bound i dared not thinki deemed myself dead the world i saw was not the world i knewi believed i was in some spiritland beyond the grave whose secrets i should presently realize perchance too well onon we wenti keeping my strained sight fixed for the most part on the supreme shape that always confronted methat angelfoe whose eyes were wild with an eternity of sorrows face to face with such an immortal despair i stood confounded and slain forever in my own regarda worthless atom meriting naught but annihilation the wailing cries and groans had ceasedand we sped on in an awful silencewhile countless tragediesunnameable historieswere urged upon me in the dumb eloquence of the dreary faces round me and the expressive teaching of their terrific eyes soon the barriers of ice were passedand the flame floated out beyond them into a warm inland sea calm as a lake and bright as silver in the broad radiance of the moon on either side were undulating shores rich with lofty and luxuriant verdurei saw the distant hazy outline of dusky purple hillsi heard the little waves plashing against hidden rocks and murmuring upon the sand delicious odours filled the aira gentle breeze blew was this the lost paradisethis semitropic zone concealed behind a continent </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> continent of ice and snow suddenly from the tops of the dark branching trees came floating the sound of a birds singingand so sweet was the song so heartwhole was the melody that my aching eyes filled with tears beautiful memories rushed upon methe value and graciousness of lifelife on the kindly sunlit earthseemed very dear to my soul lifes opportunitiesits joys its wonders its blessings all showered down upon a thankless race by a loving creatorthese appeared to me all at once as marvellous oh for another chance of such lifeto redeem the pastto gather up the wasted gems of lost momentsto live as a man should live in accordance with the will of god and in brotherhood with his fellowmen the unknown bird sang on in a cadence like that of a mavis in spring only more tunefullysurely no other woodland songster ever sang half so well and as its dulcet notes dropped roundly one by one upon the mystic silence i saw a pale creature move out from amid the shadowing of black and scarlet wingsa white womanshape clothed in her own long hair she glided to the vessels edge and there she leaned with anguished face upturnedit was the face of sibyl and even while i looked upon her she cast herself wildly down upon the deck and wept my soul was stirred within me i saw in very truth all that she might have beeni realized what an angel a little guiding love and patience might have made her and at last i pitied her i never pitied her before and now many familiar faces shone upon me like white stars in a mist of rainall faces of the deadall marked with unquenchable remorse and sorrow one figure passed before me drearily in fetters glistening with a weight of goldi knew him for my collegefriend of olden days another crouching on the ground in fear i recognised as him who had staked his last possession at play even to his immortal souli even saw my fathers face worn and aghast with grief and trembled lest the sacred beauty of her who had died to give me birth should find a place among these direful horrors but nothank god i never saw herher spirit had not lost its way to heaven again my eyes reverted to the mover of this mystic scenethat fallen splendour whose majestic shape now seemed to fill both earth and sky a fiery glory blazed about him he raised his hand the ship stoppedand the dark steersman rested motionless on the wheel round us the moonlit landscape was spread like a glittering dream of fairylandand still the unknown bird of god sang on with such entrancing tenderness as must have soothed hells tortured souls lo here we pause said the commanding voicehere where the distorted shape of man hath never cast a shadowherewhere the arrogant mind of man hath never conceived a sinhere where the godless greed of man hath never defaced a beauty or slain a woodland thinghere the last spot on earth left untainted by mans presence here is the worlds endwhen this land is found and these shores profanedwhen mammon plants its foot upon this soilthen dawns the judgmentday but until then here where only god doth work perfection angels may look down undismayed and even fiends find rest a solemn sound of music surged upon the airand i who had been as one in chains bound by invisible bonds and unable to stir was suddenly liberated fully conscious of freedom i still faced the dark gigantic figure of my foefor his luminous eyes were now upon me and his penetrating voice addressed me only man deceive not thyself he saidthink not the terrors of this night are the delusion of a dream or the snare of a vision thou art awakenot sleepingthou art flesh as well as spirit this place is neither hell nor heaven nor any space betweenit is a corner of thine own world on which thou livest wherefore know from henceforth that the supernatural universe in and around the natural is no liebut the chief reality inasmuch as god surroundeth all fate strikes thine hourand in this hour tis given thee to choose thy master now by the will of god thou seest me as angelbut take heed thou forget not that among men i am as man in human form i move with all humanity through endless agesto kings and counsellors to priests and scientists to thinkers and teachers to old and young i come in the shape their pride or vice demands and am as one with all self finds in me another egobut from the pure in heart the high in faith the perfect in intention i do retreat with joy offering naught save reverence demanding naught save prayer so am iso must i ever betill man of his own will releases and redeems me mistake me not but know meand choose thy future for truths sake and not out of fear choose and change not in any time hereafterthis hour this moment is thy last probationchoose i say wilt thou serve self and me or god only the question seemed thundered on my ears shuddering i looked from right to left and saw a gathering crowd of faces white wistful wondering threatening and imploringthey pressed about me close with glistening eyes and lips that moved dumbly and as they stared upon me i beheld another spectral thingthe image of myselfa poor frail creature pitiful ignorant and undiscerninglimited in both capacity and intelligence yet full of strange egotism and still stranger arrogance every detail of my life was suddenly presented to me as in a magic mirror and i read my own chronicle of paltry intellectual pride vulgar ambition and vulgarer ostentationi realised with shame my miserable vices my puny scorn of god my effronteries and blasphemies and in the sudden strong repulsion and repudiation of my own worthless existence being and character i found both voice and speech god only i cried ferventlyannihilation at his hands rather than life without him god only i have chosen my words vibrated passionately on my own ears and even as they were spoken the air grew misty with a snowy opalescent radiance the sable and crimson wings uplifted in such multitudinous array around me palpitated with a thousand changeful hues and over the face of my dark foe a light celestial fell like the smile of dawn awed and afraid i gazed upward and there i saw a new and yet more wondrous glory a shining figure outlined against the sky in such surpassing beauty and vivid brilliancy as made me think the sun itself had risen in vast angelshape on rainbow pinions and from the brightening heaven there rang a silver voice clear as a clarioncall arise lucifer son of the morning one soul rejects theeone hour of joy is granted thee hence and arise earth air and sea blazed suddenly into fiery goldblinded and stunned i was seized by compelling hands and held firmly down by a force invisible the yacht was slowly sinking under me overwhelmed with unearthly terrors my lips yet murmured god god only the heavens changed from gold to crimsonanon to shining blue and against this mass of wavering colour that seemed to make a jewelled archway of the sky i saw the form of him whom i had known as man swiftly ascend godlike with flaming pinions and upturned glorious visage like a vision of light in darkness around him clustered a million winged shapesbut he supreme majestic wonderful towered high above them all a very king of splendour the glory round his brows resembling meteorfires in an arctic midnighthis eyes twin stars ablaze with such great rapture as seemed half agony breathless and giddy i strained my sight to follow him as he fled and heard the musical calling of strange sweet voices everywhere from east to west from north to south lucifer belovd and unforgotten lucifer son of the morning arise arise with all my remaining strength i strove to watch the vanishing upward of that sublime luminance that now filled the visible universethe demonship was still sinking steadily invisible hands still held me down i was fallingfallinginto unimaginable depths when another voice till then unheard solemn yet sweet spoke aloud bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outermost darkness of the world there let him find my light i heardyet felt no fear god only i said as i sank into the vast profoundand lo while the words yet trembled on my lips i saw the sun the sweet earths sunthe kindly orb familiarthe lamp of gods protectionits golden rim came glittering upwards in the easthigher and higher it rose making a shining background for that mighty figure whose darkly luminous wings now seemed like sable stormclouds stretched wide across the horizon once more yet once the angelvisage bent its warning looks on me i saw the anguished smile the great eyes burning with immortal sorrows then i was plunged forcibly downwards and thrust into an abysmal grave of frozen cold xlii the blue seathe blue skyand gods sunshine over all to this i woke after a long period of unconsciousness and found myself afloat on a wide ocean fast bound to a wooden spar so strongly knotted were my bonds that </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> that i could not stir either hand or foot and after one or two ineffectual struggles to move i gave up the attempt and lay submissively resigned to my fate face upturned and gazing at the infinite azure depths above me while the heaving breath of the sea rocked me gently to and fro like an infant in its mothers arms alone with god and nature i a poor human wreck driftedlost yet found lost on this vast sea which soon should serve my body as a sepulchre but found inasmuch as i was fully conscious of the existence and awakening of the immortal soul within methat divine actual and imperishable essence which now i recognised as being all that is valuable in a man in the sight of his creator i was to die soon and surelythis i thought as the billows swayed me in their huge cradle running in foamy ripples across my bound body and dashing cool spray upon my browswhat could i do now doomed and helpless as i was to retrieve my wasted past nothing save repentand could repentance at so late an hour fit the laws of eternal justice humbly and sorrowfully i considered to me had been given a terrific and unprecedented experience of the awful reality of the spiritworld around usand now i was cast out on the sea as a thing worthless i felt that the brief time remaining to me of life in this present sphere was indeed my last probation as that supernatural wonder the declared enemy of mankind whom still in my thoughts i called lucio had declared if i daredafter a lifes denial and blasphemyturn to christ i saidwould hethe divine brother and friend of manreject me i whispered the question to the sky and sea solemn silence seemed to invest the atmosphere and marvellous calm no other answer came than this a deep and charmd peace that insensibly stole over my fretting conscience my remorseful soul my aching heart my tired mind i remembered certain words heard long ago and lightly forgotten him who cometh unto me will i in no wise cast out looking up to the clear heavens and radiant sun i smiled and with a complete abandonment of myself and my fears to the divine will i murmured the words that in my stress of mystic agony had so far saved me god only whatsoever he shall choose for me in life in death and after death is best and closing my eyes i resigned my life to the mercy of the soft waves and with the sunbeams warm upon my face i slept i woke again with an icy shudder and cryrough cheery voices sounded in my earsstrong hands were at work busily unfastening the cords with which i was bound i was on the deck of a large steamer surrounded by a group of menand all the glory of the sunset fired the seas questions were poured upon me i could not answer them for my tongue was parched and blistered lifted upright upon my feet by sturdy arms i could not stand for sheer exhaustion dimly and in feeble dread i stared around mewas this great vessel with smoking funnels and grinding engines another devils craft set sailing round the world too weak to find a voice i made dumb signs of terrified inquiry a broadshouldered blufflooking man came forward whose keen eyes rested on me with kindly compassion this is an english vessel he saidwe are bound for southampton our helmsman saw you floating aheadwe stopped and sent a boat for rescue where were you wrecked any more of the crew afloat i gazed at him but could not speak the strangest thoughts crowded into my brain moving me to wild tears and laughter england the word struck clashing music on my mind and set all my pulses trembling england the little spot upon the little world most loved and honoured of all men save those who envy its worth i made some gesture whether of joy or mad amazement i know nothad i been able to speak i could have related nothing that those men around me could have comprehended or believed then i sank back again in a dead swoon they were very good to me all those english sailors the captain gave me his own cabinthe ships doctor attended me with a zeal that was only exceeded by his curiosity to know where i came from and the nature of the disaster that had befallen me but i remained dumb and lay inert and feeble in my berth grateful for the care bestowed upon me as well as for the temporary exhaustion that deprived me of speech for i had enough to do with my own thoughtsthoughts far too solemn and weighty for utterance i was savedi was given another chance of life in the worldand i knew why my one absorbing anxiety now was to retrieve my wasted time and to do active good where hitherto i had done nothing the day came at last when i was sufficiently recovered to be able to sit on deck and watch with eager eyes the approaching coastline of england i seemed to have lived a century since i left itaye almost an eternityfor time is what the soul makes it and no more i was an object of interest and attention among all the passengers on board for as yet i had not broken silence the weather was calm and bright the sun shone gloriouslyand far off the pearly rim of shakespeares happy isle glistened jewellike upon the edge of the sea the captain came and looked at menodded encouraginglyand after a moments hesitation said glad to see you out on deck almost yourself again eh i silently assented with a faint smile perhapshe continued as were so near home youll let me know your name its not often we pick up a man alive and drifting in midatlantic in midatlantic what force had flung me there i dared not think nor whether it was hellish or divine my name i murmured surprised into speechhow odd it was i had never thought of myself lately as having a name or any other thing belonging to mewhy certainly geoffrey tempest is my name the captains eyes opened widely geoffrey tempest dear me the mr tempestthe great millionaire that was it was now my turn to stare that was i repeatedwhat do you mean have you not heard he asked excitedly heard i have heard nothing since i left england some months agowith a friend on board his yacht we went on a long voyage and a strange one we were wrecked you know the rest and how i owe my life to your rescue but of news i am ignorant good heavens he interrupted quicklybad news travels fast as a rule they saybut you have missed it and i confess i dont like to be the bearer of it he broke off and his genial face looked troubled i smiledyet wondered pray speak out i saidi dont think you can tell me anything that will deeply affect menow i know the best and worst of most things in the world i assure you he eyed me dubiouslythen going into his smokingcabin he brought me out an american newspaper seven days old he handed it to me pointing to its leading columns without a word there i saw in large typea millionaire ruined enormous frauds monster forgeries gigantic swindle on the track of bentham and ellis my brain swam for a minutethen i read on steadily and soon grasped the situation the respectable pair of lawyers whom i had implicitly relied on for the management of all my business affairs in my absence had succumbed to the temptation of having so much cash in charge for investmentand had become a pair of practised swindlers dealing with the same bank as myself they had forged my name so cleverly that the genuineness of the signature had never been even suspectedand after drawing enormous sums in this way and investing in various bubble companies with which they personally were concerned they had finally absconded leaving me almost as poor as i was when i first heard of my inherited fortune i put aside the paper and looked up at the good captain who stood watching me with sympathetic anxiety thank you i saidthese thieves were my trusted lawyersand i can cheerfully say that i am much more sorry for them than i am for myself a thief is always a thiefa poor man if he be honest is at any rate the thiefs superior the money they have stolen will bring them misery rather than pleasureof that i am convinced if this account be correct they have already lost large sums in bogus companiesand the man bentham whom i thought the very acme of shrewd caution has sunk an enormous amount of capital in a wornout gold mine their forgeries must have been admirably donea sad waste of time and cleverness it appears too that the investments i have myself made are worthlesswell wellit does not matteri must begin the world again thats all he looked amazed i dont think you quite realize your own misfortune mr tempesthe saidyou take it too quietly by half youll think worse of it presently i </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> i hope not i responded with a smileit never does to think the worst of anything i assure you i realize perfectly i am in the worlds sight a ruined mani quite understand he shrugged his shoulders with quite a desperate air and left me i am convinced he thought me madbut i knew i had never been so sane i did indeed entirely comprehend my misfortune or rather the great chance bestowed on me of winning something far higher than all the coffers of mammon i read in my loss of worlds cash the working of such a merciful providence and pity as gave me a grander hope than any i had ever known clear before me rose the vision of that most divine and beautiful necessity of happinessworkthe grand and too often misprized angel of labour which moulds the mind of man steadies his hands controls his brain purifies his passions and strengthens his whole mental and physical being a rush of energy and health filled my veinsand i thanked god devoutly for the golden opportunities held out afresh for me to accept and use gratitude there should be in every human soul for every gift of heavenbut nothing merits more thankfulness and praise to the creator than the call to work and the ability to respond to it england at last i bade farewell to the good ship that had rescued me and to all on board her most of whom now knew my name and looked upon me with pity as well as curiosity the story of my being wrecked on a friends yacht was readily acceptedand the subject of that adventure was avoided as the general impression was that my friend whoever he was had been drowned with his crew and that i was the one survivor i did not offer any further explanation and was content to so let the matter rest though i was careful to send both the captain and the ships doctor a handsome recompense for their united attention and kindness i have reason to believe from the letters they wrote me that they were more than satisfied with the sums received and that i really did some actual good with those few last fragments of my vanished wealth on reaching london i interviewed the police concerning the thieves and forgers bentham and ellis and stopped all proceedings against them call me mad if you likei said to the utterly confounded chief of the detective forcei do not mind but let these rascals keep the trash they have stolen it will be a curse to them as it has been to me it is devils money half of it was already gone being settled on my late wifeat her death it reverted by the same deed of settlement to any living members of her family and it now belongs to lord elton i have lived to make a noble earl rich who was once bankruptand i doubt if he would lend me a tenpoundnote for the asking however i shall not ask him the rest has gone into the universal waste of corruption and shamlet it stay there i shall never bother myself to get it back i prefer to be a free man but the bankthe principle of the thing exclaimed the detective with indignation i smiled exactly the principle of the thing has been perfectly carried out a man who has too much money creates forgers and thieves about himhe cannot expect to meet with honesty let the bank prosecute if it likesi shall not i am freefree to work for my living what i earn i shall enjoywhat i inherited i have learnt to loathe with that i left him puzzled and irateand in a day or two the papers were full of strange stories concerning me and numerous lies as well i was called mad unprincipled thwarting the ends of justiceand sundry other names while scurrilous civilities known only to the penny paragraphist were heaped upon me by the score to complete my entire satisfaction a man on the staff of one of the leading journals dug out my book from mudies underground cellar and slashed it with a bitterness and venom only excelled by my own violence when anonymously libelling the work of mavis clare and the result was remarkablefor in a sudden wind of caprice the public made a rush for my neglected literary offspringthey took it up handled it tenderly read it lingeringly found something in it that pleased them and finally bought it by thousands whereat the astute morgeson as virtuous publisher wrote to me in wonder and congratulation enclosing a cheque for a hundred pounds on royalties and promising more in due course should the run continue ah the sweetness of that earned hundred pounds i felt a king of independencerealms of ambition and attainment opened out before melife smiled upon me as it had never smiled before talk of poverty i was richrich with a hundred pounds made out of my own brainlabourand i envied no millionaire that ever flaunted his gold beneath the sun i thought of mavis clare but dared not dwell too long upon her gentle image in time perhaps when i had settled down to fresh work when i had formed my life as i meant to form it in the habits of faith firmness and unselfishness i would write to her and tell her allall even to that dread insight into worlds unseen beyond the boundaries of an unknown region of everlasting frozen snow but nownow i resolved to stand alonefighting my battle as a man should fight seeking for neither help nor sympathy and trusting not in self but god only moreover i could not induce myself yet to look again upon willowsmere the place was terrorhaunted for me and though lord elton with a curious condescension seeing that it was to me he owed the free gift of his former property invited me to stay there and professed a certain lame regret for the heavy financial losses i had sustained i saw in the tone of his epistle that he looked upon me somewhat in the light of a madman after my refusal to take up the matter of my absconding solicitors and that he would rather i stayed away and i did stay awayand even when his marriage with diana chesney took place with great pomp and splendour i refused his invitation to be present in the published list of guests however which appeared in the principal papers i was scarcely surprised to read the name of prince lucio rimnez i now took a humble room and set to work on a new literary enterprise avoiding everyone i had hitherto known for being now almost a poor man i was aware that swagger society wished to blot me from its visitinglist i lived with my own sorrowful thoughtsmusing on many things training myself to humility obedience and faith with fortitudeand day by day i did battle with the monster egotism that presented itself in a thousand disguises at every turn in my own life as well as in the lives of others i had to reform my characterto mould the obstinate nature that rebelled and make its obstinacy serve for the attainment of higher objects than worlds renownthe task was difficultbut i gained ground a little with every fresh effort i had lived for some months like this in bitter selfabasement when all the reading world was suddenly electrified by another book of mavis clares my lately favoured first work was again forgotten and thrust asidehers slated and screamed at as usual by the criticasters was borne along to fame by a great wave of honest public praise and enthusiasm and i i rejoicedno longer grudging or envious of her sweet fame i stood apart in spirit as it were while the bright car of her triumph went by decked not only with laurels but with rosesthe blossoms of a peoples love and honour with all my soul i reverenced her geniuswith all my heart i honoured her pure womanliness and in the very midst of her brilliant success when all the world was talking of her she wrote to me a simple little letter as gracious as her own fair name dear mr tempest i heard by chance the other day that you had returned to england i therefore send this note to the care of your publisher to express my sincere delight in the success your clever book has now attained after its interval of probation i fancy the public appreciation of your work must go far to console you for the great losses you have had both in life and fortune of which i will not here speak when you feel that you can bear to look again upon scenes which i know will be sure to rouse in your mind many sad and poignant memories will you come and see me your friend mavis clare a mist came before my eyesi almost felt her gentle presence in my roomi saw the tender look the radiant smilethe innocent yet earnest joy in life and love of purity that emanated from the fair personality of the sweetest woman i had ever known she called herself my friend it was a privilege of which i felt myself unworthy i folded
