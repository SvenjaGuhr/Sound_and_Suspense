 <lowSuspense1> bell howell the historian who would wish his lessons to sink deep into the heart thereby essaying to render mankind virtuous and more happy must not content himself with simply detailing a series of eventshe must ascertain causes and follow progressively their effects he must draw deductions from incidents as they arise and ever revert to the actuating principle about the latter end of the fifteenth century on the birthnight of the young victoria de loredani most of the youthful nobility of any rank in venice were assembled at the palazzo of her parents to do honour to the festivalthe hearts of all appeared in unison with the hilarity of the scene even the lovely and haughty victoria smiled with an unchecked vivacity for no fair venetian had presumed to vie with her either in beauty of person or splendour of decoration another circumstance contributed to elevate her spirits and render her triumph complete leonardo her brother ever haughty and turbulent in his manners had acknowledged that she outshone every female present at this time the marchese di loredani had been married seventeen years to laurina di corners a female of unexampled beauty and of rare and singular endowments if she possessed a foible it arose from vanity from too great a thirst of admiration and confidence in herself at the period of her marriage with the marchese she was scarcely fifteen and he himself not more than twentyit was a marriage contracted without the concurrence without even the knowledge of respective friends resolved on in the delirium of passion concluded in the madness of youth yet unlike the too frequent result disgust and repentance did not follow this impetuous union for chance and circumstances happily combined to render it propitious time had not yet perfected the character of laurina she saw beside her an husband whose ardent love appeared to suffer no diminution no temptations crossed her pathit required then no effort to be virtuous and as in revolving years reason approved the choice of a passion at the time undiscriminating she gradually adored as an husband him she had thoughtlessly selected as a lover two children within two years after their marriage had been its only fruits from this circumstance lavish and imprudent was the fondness bestowed by the parents upon their idolized offspring boundless and weak was the indulgence forever shewn to them the youthful parents little comprehended the extent of the mischief they were doing to see their wayward children happy their infantine and lovely faces disfigured by tears or vexation was a pleasure too great to be resigned from the distant reflection of future evil possible to accrue from the indulgence the consequence was that victoria though at the age of fifteen beautiful and accomplished as an angel was proud haughty and selfsufficient of a wild ardent and irrepressible spirit indifferent to reproof careless of censure of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of an implacable revengeful and cruel nature and bent upon gaining the ascendancy in whatever she engaged the young leonardo who was a year older than his sister having been as much the victim of an injurious fondness as herself possessed with all the bolder shades of her character a warm impassioned soul yielding easily to the seductions of the wild and beautiful accessible of temptation and unable to resist in any shape the first impulses of his heart this disposition though it perhaps might never lead him into vice would prevent him from repelling its inroads with the iron shield of energy he was violent and revengeful yet capable of sacrificing himself to a sentiment of gratitude he had a quick impatient sense of honourfeelings noble though impetuous and a pride encouraged infinitely by the marchese of birth and family dignity which sooner than by an act of meanness have disgraced he would have perished thus it could not be denied that in his illregulated character were some bright tints such were the children whom early education had tended equally to corrupt and such were the children whom to preserve from future depravity required the most vigilant care aided by such brilliant examples of virtue and decorum as should induce the desire of emulation thus would have been counteracted the evils engendered by the want of steady attention to the propensities of childhood yet with all these causes for reflection and deep regretcauses which did not strike the broad beam of conviction upon the eyes of the infatuated parents yet were they happy the whole city of venice contained no pair so happy laurina di loredani still in the meridian of beauty and still adored by an husband though not with the fantastic delirium of a boy yet with an enthusiastic and approved affection the most beneficent the noblest and the best of human beings was the marchese admired by all yet living alone for her whom his boyish heart had worshipped his unsuspicious and generous nature gloried in the attractions of his wisest see her followed and admired yielded to his heart a pleasure exquisite and refinedto hers a sentiment less noble because it centered in selfgratification and considerations of self ever debase the heart at this juncture it may not be amiss for a few moments to digress in stating that at the period which commences this history the venetians were a proud strict and fastidious peoplein no country was the pride of nobility carried to a greater extent their manners also received a deep and gloomy tincture from the nature of their government which in its character was jealous and suspicious dooming sometimes to a public sometimes to a private death on mere surmise or apprehension of design against the state and always by secret trial its most distinguished members this power was exercised by il consilio di diei or council of ten by ordering nobles to be hung by the feet between the pillars of st marc or else dispatching them more privately that the order might not suffer in the opinion of the people by plunging their bodies in the orfano or otherwise the venetians were fond of their mistresses and jealous of their wives to a degree uniting the spanish and italian character in its most sublimated state of passion to avenge an injury sustained or supposed to be so to atchieve a favourite point or gratify a desire otherwise unobtainable poison or the dagger were constantly resorted to sanguinary and violent by nature climate habit and education the hatred of the venetians once excited became implacable and endured through life having thus briefly reverted to the character of a nation where the principal scenes of the following history are laid we proceed with matter more immediately connected with it it was in the midst of the gay reveling in the palazzo di loredani that a stranger arriving at the gates requested admittance to the marchese on being told that he acquainted with his name desired to see him the marchese ordered immediately that the person should be admitted when the doors of the saloon being thrown open a graceful figure entered respectfully bowing and presented to loredani a letter from the baron wurmsburg a german nobleman and most intimate friend of his wherein he requested of the marchese that he would exercise his hospitality in favour of count ardolph the bearer a german likewise of high rank fortune and unblemished character no sooner had the marchese di loredani perused the letter than with conciliating politeness he extended his hand to the count and led him immediately to the upper end of the saloon where laurina her daughter and the rest of the company had assembled that the stranger on his entrance might not be disconcerted or pained by fancied observation he introduced him first to the marchesa and then to the company in general there was that in the air and striking appearance of the count which created at once a sensation of awe and admiration his figure was noble and commanding and in his features shone a dignity and fascination which while it irresistibly attracted the regards of all flattered and delighted if his could be attracted in return yet once attracted those powerful regards overpowered by their beauty and their brilliancy those on whom they turned such in his personal semblance was count ardolph and as such drew speedily around him a bright circle of which he became the focus every one forgetting in the ease and gracefulness of his manners the recentness of his introduction while his presence diffused around a spirit a vivacity and an interest of which before the assembly had seemed unconscious victoria as the young divinity of the festival was presented to him by her beautiful and scarce less blooming mother the eyes of the count dwelt momentarily </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> momentarily upon her charms he complimented her with politeness but not with warmth and turned immediately to the marchesa with an air so expressive of admiration that an insignificant observer might have remarked the difference of his regards at a late hour the company separated and count ardolph was conducted to splendid apartment in the palazzo of be marchese before we proceed some account must be given of count ardolph as to the bent of his principles and character as to his introduction amid the illfated family of loredani may be ascribed the origin of those misfortunes which subsequently overwhelmed them by birth he was german being left early in life from the death of an only surviving parent to his own disposal he quitted his native country and visited france and england in both places instigated at once by inclinations naturally vicious and the contamination of bad example he plunged into such a stream of depravity as rendered him ina few years callous to every sentiment of honour and delicacy but the species of crime the dreadful and diabolical triumph which gratified his worthless heart the most was to destroy not the fair fame of an innocent unsullied femalenot to deceive and abandon a trusting yielding maiden he loved to take higher and more destructive aimhis was the savage delight to intercept the happiness of wedded loveth wean from an adoring husband the regards of a pure and faithful wisest blast with his baleful breath the happiness of a young and rising family to seduce the best the noblest affections of the heart and to glory and to exult in the widespreading havoc he had caused endowed with a form cast in natures finest mould blest or rather cursed with abilities to astonish and enslave possessed if every grace and every charm that could render a man the most dangerous or the most perfect of his sex he employed these rare and fascinating qualities as a demon would put on the semblance of an angel to mislead and to betray yet even of perpetual conquest the heart of man will grow weary ardolph as the fury of passion or excitement of vanity became gratified and assuaged sunk into inanity and despising all he had acquired disdaining those females whose blandishments while they had momentarily enchanted his senses had been incapable of touching his heart he quitted paris the hotbed of his vices and profligacy in disgust and hoped by change of scene to give a zest to those feelings which excessive and unlimited gratification had blunted and almost destroyed yet in change of scene he had as yet failed of finding what he sought with an anxious and impatient curiosity a woman who should be capable of inspiring his heart with continued sensation for the proud ardolph denied in his mind the possibility of the existence of such a woman he analysed and investigated with too contemptuous and prejudiced an eye not to find in the sex an infinity of folly weakness and inconsistency thus it was that having triumphed over them he disdained his conquest and disdained himself to have been attracted by them such was the sceptical the cruel the dangerous ardolph at the period of his arrival in venice for which place the baron wurmsburg a friend and distant relative of his family seeing him only such as he appeared to be for ardolph had deigned to revisit for a short period his native land gave him to the marchese di loredani an introductory letter little suspecting the depravity of his heart he recommended him in strong terms to the kindness and hospitality of that nobleman building that recommendation upon the strength of an honourable friendship formerly subsisting between them to venice ardolph had only come in search of novelty and amusement to find if possible fresh scope for the gratification of his seductive and destroying talents little expecting however that he should meet with aught to attract or to retain him therewe now hasten to the more circumstantial part of our history he had not been long an envious and ungrateful guest in the house of loredani ere he beheld with evil eye the happiness which reigned among them his soul burned to disfigure the beautiful fabric of a familys happiness and to scatter around him misery and devastation but to atchieve this on whom did the malignant fiend fix his regards not on the young the ardent and selfconfident victoria but on her lovely and attractive motherhood the wife of his hospitable unsuspecting hostof the man who daily and hourly showered down civilities and attentions on him it was his honour andhis happiness that he sought to blightit was his offspring whom he sought to destroy and to disgrace it was his wife whom he sought to seduce such was the gratitude of man to man and such still it continues to be but it so happened that susceptible as was laurina to admiration and more particularly so from a man of the high accomplishments and endowments of count ardolph she still loved her husband with an undiminished love and considered him as the god of his sex the attention and the admiration she excited were certainly a source of gratification to her but then she excused herself with the belief that it was as much on his account as on her own and hence was a most powerful barrier opposed to the machinations of the wily ardolph but unfortunately opposition and difficulty were what he had long and ardently sought it strung his dangerous energies anew and while he gazed on the glowing charms of the devoted wife and beheld with darkened eye their faithful vassalage to her husband he vowed even in the centre of his guilty heart that he would conqueror perish in the attempt he had now been nearly three months under the </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> the roof the marchese when a profound melancholy partly occasioned by a view of happiness he had not yet destroyed and partly by the gradual increase of sensations to which he had till now been a stranger appeared to take entire possession of him whether it was the beautiful and unobtrusive virtues of laurina or whether it was that her high and protected situation by enhancing the danger and boldness of his attempt added fuel to his passion cannot be ascertained certain it was women more beautiful than the marchesa had been tempted obtained and forsaken by him it could not therefore allseducing as she was be her person only that enslaved him and for the beauties of mind further than they added glory to the destruction he caused he had little devotion how then happened it that on frequent occasions rushing from her presence in a delirium of rage and passion he discovered and avowed to his proud heart the ascendancy she had gained over its hitherto frigid insensibility sometimes in imagination he would reduce her in an instant to the level of those unfortunates he had betrayed and abandoned but even so she was still laurina and he felt that over her he could gain no triumph thus in the maddening passion which hourly consumed him did he experience some slight retribution for the misery he had so often caused to others mean time laurina on remarking his increasing melancholy had experienced sensations in her bosom which she wished not to investigate she could not help perceiving for so the insidious ardolph had desired that it was a melancholy not independent of herself his stolen yet purposely betrayed ardent glances directed towards herhis deep sighs the tumultuousness of his frame if by accident he touched her hand or even any part of her dressall all failed not to be observed by the marchesa and to make its unfortunate impression yet had she never even in thought strayed from her husbands so gradual so unsuspected are the first approaches of a guilty passion to the heart that she would have started on being told she felt more for ardolph than the interest of friendship it was one evening that straying pensively down an avenue in the garden she suddenly encountered him not however accidentally on his side who was forming unconsciously to herself a portion of her thoughts he appeared before her pale haggard and with an expression of wretchedness on his countenance deeper than any he had yet worn involuntarily she flopped and looking with kindness in his face asked in a soothing voice if he were ill an enquiry into the cause of his complaint was all he had anxiously desired but had not yet ventured to expect thrown for once however off his guard no longer master of his violent emotions he threw himself at her feet and acknowledged in hurried accents the passion with which she had filled up his heart confounded bewildered and overcome the trembling laurina knew not how to fly yet to remain an instant after an avowal so base would she felt be infamous and participating in its guilt she made an agitated attempt to disengage herself from the count who on his knees grasped wildly between his hands one of hers but in admitting to her thoughts even for an instant any other man than her husbandman listening for an instant to an acknowledgment of the passion with which she had inspired spired him the unhappy laurina had advanced one step in the path of vice and to recede required an energy and resolution almost incompatible with the weakness of which she had been already guiltyat length inspired with sudden resolution touched as it were by a keen sense of the impropriety of her situation she snatched her hand from the deluding ardolph and flying from his presence sought in the solitude of her chamber vent to her emotions there sunk in shame and absorbed in retrospection she dared not analyse the feelings excited in her bosom a thousand times did she wish that count ardolph had never entered the palazzo loredani but the reigning the only foible of her nature whispered to her the brilliant triumph of captivating such an heart as his whose every smile whose every look seemed a condescension from the superiority of his nature oh selflovedangerous and resistless flattererthou immolate at thy shrine more victims than all the artifices of man earnestly did laurina desire to be virtuous earnestly did she pray for fortitude to preserve her from the power of temptation but she had not strength to fly from it and in that alone her safety would have consisted her mind became torn with conflicting sentiments her reason her gratitude the secret and powerful ties of early habit taught her to adore her husband but the insidious ardolph daily led her senses wandering and corrupted the purity of her heart in his company she became thoughtful and embarrassed in his absence restless and unhappy the cruel ardolph perceived his advantage and pursued it like a keen bloodhound he hunted the wretched victim of his pursuit even to the brink of destructionno friendly hand extended to save her no guardian angel hovered nigh and ere she knew the extent of her danger she was far beyond the reach of preservation that it is but too often an ungenerous principle in human nature first most ardently to desire the possession of a certain object and despise it when obtained cannot be disowned in the present instance however there was an exception to this principle a real passion had absorbed for the first time the heart of the seducer ardolph to have estranged from an husband the honour of his wife to have gained over her sacred virtue a dreadful ascendancy did not satisfy him he resolved to possess her </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> her whollyto blast the doting husband with conviction of his dishonour to plunge his offspring in eternal ruin and disgrace and to despoil them of the protection and tender services of a mother for the atchievement of this purpose he found it necessary to degrade completely in her own eyes the miserable and deluded laurina then profiting by her agony and despair he represented to her that it was in fact adding to her guilt ina most flagrant and abominable degree to remain under the roof of him she conceived herself to have so deeply injured was it not adding treachery to dishonour and was it not in reality the crime of deceiving under such circumstances far beyond that of acknowledging her guilt by an immediate and honourable flight if the treasure is gone pursued the sophisticating ardolph the casket can but little avail and could you then laurina live a life of deception deluding your husband in the idea of fondly possessing a treasure that is no longer his ohno no cried the wretched wife leave me oh cruel ardolph fly for ever from mehere will i remain and die and may the tortures i now endure expiate in the sight of a merciful god the most infamous of crimes but ardolph the eloquent friend whose seductive blandishments had so far destroyed the delicate fabric of connubial happiness was not to be diverted from the most material part of his task for flight is the perseverance required to atchieve that which is already more than half accomplished he vowed and he oven believed at the moment that his vow was sincere that while life endured he would adore her who for his sake had forfeited so much my childrenoh my children deeply sighed the frantic laurina may those children exclaimed ardolph calling upon outraged heaven to attest the prayer may those children witness nay perpetrate my destruction should ever my heart become cold towards thee let us forbear to dwell on this scene of weakness on the one hand and depravity on the other complete as he could wish was the triumph of the seducer he bore his victim from the scenes of her past honour and her happiness he bore her from her home from the arms of her husbandfrom the embraces of her childrenand far from venice the place of her nativity to paint the horror of loredani when he discovered the perfidy of those whom his noble heart had cherished and relied onthe wife he had fondly adored the guest he had received and trustedwould if expression could do justice to it be superfluous he beheld himself at once the wretched the desolate and the only guardian of his forsaken children forsaken by her who had given them birth from the wildness of despair he emerged and strung himself to virtuous resolution determined while his heart would hold from breaking to live for his children and to supply to them as far as the love and protection of a father could the fallen but once virtuous mother they had lost thus did the marchese court to his aid those divine energies of which good minds are ever susceptible but another trial awaited him still scarcely had he acquired fortitude to leave the gloomy solitude of his chamber ere fresh wounds were inflicted upon his lacerated heart by the horrid tidings that leonardo his son the pride and heir of his house had soon as the flight of his mother became known rushed from his home and never since returnedwell did the proud though agonised father trace in this action of his boy his noble tenacious and impetuous spiritwell did he trace exult and participate in the glorious feelings whose ebullition could not be restrained and while he deplored the rashness of such conduct he adored the sentiment that had impelled it yet fondly he hoped that the young enthusiast when the indignant fervor of the moment should have subsided would return to be pressed in the arms of his widowed parent and to mingle his tears with his he entertained the idea that under the first painful impression of shame and grief he had perhaps secreted himself at the house of a friend but when every friend had been questioned and day after day had elapsed and still he came not the expectant heartsick and disappointed father with bitter reluctance resigned all hope and pressing his solitary daughter in his arms saw concentred in her all that must attach him to existence and preserve him from despair victoria thus the idol the hope and only solace of the heartbroken marchese was become the deity to which the house looked up her word was law throughout and to dispute the smallest of her wishes would have been deemed amounting to sacrilege ever of a bold and towering spirit haughty fond of sway it was with difficulty that her partial mother could occasionally administer a slight reproof but now with an unlimited scope for the growth of these dangerous propensities they bade fair soon to overtop the power of restriction vainly did the marchese hope that time by maturing her reason and improving her ideas would correct the wrong bias of her character for strict education alone can correct the faults in our nature they will not correct themselves if improper tendencies are engendered by early neglect education may still work a reform for we are in a great measure the creatures of education rather than of organisation the former can almost always surmount the defects of the latter thus though victoria in childhood gave proofs of what is termed somewhat injudiciously a corrupt nature yet a firm and decided course of education would so far have changed her bent that those propensities which by neglect became vices might have been ameliorated into virtues for example haughtiness might have been softened </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> softened into noble pride cruelty into courage implacability into firmness but by being suffered to grow entirely wild they overrun the fair garden of the mind and prevented proper principles from taking root what then must bethought of the unfortunate and guilty mother who making light of the sacred charge devolving on her the welfare of her children as depending on the just formation of their minds not only neglects that sacred charge but seals the fiat of their future destruction by setting them in her own conduct an example of moral depravitydepriving them of the worlds respect and rendering them thereby indifferent to their own with saddened eye the marchese traced occasionally the progress of his daughters character but he endeavoured to disguise from himself the suspicion that her heart was evil to add to his unhappiness the society of victoria was generally shunned not in reality on account of the disgrace brought upon her by her mothers conduct but on account of her own violent and overbearing disposition which rendered her obnoxious to the young nobility of venice the haughty girl however attributed the neglect she experienced to the former cause and as such conceiving herself deprived of the worlds consideration became daily more indifferent regarding it thus do vicious minds lay hold of every excuse for the pursuance of evil one evening about a year having elapsed since the departure of laurina as she sat in sullen silence by her sorrowing parent he turned affectionately towards her and said wherefore victoria dost thou debar thyself of the amusements befitting thine age and situation to sit in chearless solitude with me why dost thou not invite to thee thy friends and acquaintances and visit them in return victoria haughtily returnedbecause they would neither come to me nor suffer me to go to them hand why so eagerly enquired the marchese because my mother has disgraced us gloomily replied the unfeeling victoria never had the name of his unfortunate wife been uttered by the marchese since her ignominious flightnever had he reverted to or even breathed a reproach upon the baseness of her conduct the cruel victoria had roughly touched a string that reverberated to agonythe wretched father struck his forehead and springing from his seat cast a look of anguish on his daughter and rushed from the apartment but the recollections she had awakened the feelings of bitterness she had renewed rent his bosom with renovated torture never never had the memory of the misguided laurinas ingratitude left his torn mind in secret he had brooded over his misery in secret where no eye could reproach him for his weakness he had deplored and follow loved but never in the presence of a human being had he appeared to remember that he had once possessed a wise pride preserved him from public regret but his lacerated heart paid for it when alone unable to bear longer in solitude the keenness of those sensations excited by his daughter he left as the cool breezes of night came on his secluded chamber ne sought by motion to disturb the chain of thought that formed heavy in his mind and to fly if possible from himself he had wandered about some time when in an unfrequented part of the city he beheld a man walking swiftly before him he was enveloped in a cloak but the outlines of his figure were such as to send through the frame of the marchese sensations of tingling horror followed by a rage so frantic as almost to deprive him of sense he thought that in the stranger he beheld ardolph the machinating villain who had blasted his every hope and happiness unknowing what he did unaware of the violence and rapidity of his own emotions he darted after the person and tearing aside his cloak discovered indeed the wretch he had imagined draw monster devil and incendiary exclaimed the frantic husband at the same time snatching his stiletto from his bosom i have no sword coolly returned the count but i have like yourself a stiletto that shall be at your service the marchese heard no more he struck and struck again with desperate fury at he body of his antagonist but his aim was rendered unsure by his thirst for vengeance by the raging and uncontrouled passions of his soul the count calm and selfcollected parried with hellish dexterity his indiscriminate attempts but receiving at length the point of his adversarys stiletto in his shoulder he suffered an impulse of rage to nerve his hand and retreating for an instant then furiously advanced and plunged his dagger to the hilt in the breast of the unfortunate loredani thus did he become the murderer of the husband as he had been already the seducer of his wife and his guilt at the bar of heaven as used a dye seven times deeper than before the instant that the marchese sell ardolph hurried from the spot first taking care to conceal his stiletto and to wrap his cloak closely around him to seek assistance for the being he had inhumanly sacrificed entered not his ignoble mind there then weltering in his blood might the marchese have remained but for the arrival of some passengers who soon ascertaining his rank and residence conveyed him to the palazzo loredani thither a surgeon being immediately summoned dressed his wound and to the feeble yet earnest enquiries of the marchese felt compelled to pronounce it mortal tell me the utmost in a firm though low voice said he that it is possible forme to exist not longer than to morrow i fear the surgeon slowly replied tis enough said the marchese let my daughter be sent to me my lord you must not talk observed the professional attendant loredani looked upon him with an anguished smile if i have so few hours </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> hours to live he said what have i to guard againstlet me see my daughter my lord your death will be hastened the marchese feebly waved his hand victoria was called she entered the room with slow and trembling stepsshe gazed upon the deathmarked features of her father with horror and regrethorror at the situation in which she saw him and regret at the thought of having given him a few hours before a pang so deep of this emotion was victoria susceptible therefore at this moment her heart was not utterly depraved she approached the bedside of her fathered naturally stubborn heart now deeply and profoundly affected the dying marchese stretched forth his parched and trembling hand she took it and pressing it to her bosom sunk upon her knees beside him soh my childmy victoria he faintly begani am snatched from thee at a time and season when least thou canst afford to lose meyet ere i die let meoh my loveperform my duty to heaven and to thee let me implore thee to suffer my dying counsels to sink deep into thy heartmy victoria correct if thou canst the errors of thy disposition think upon what we arethink on life how unsure how unstable is its possessionthink that in the midst of buoyant health elate in youthful pride surrounded by riches and every gratification they can procure that still even for a moment we cannot ensure it some dreadful unforeseen event some accident arises and cuts us off let not therefore the riches thou wilt in all probability be mistress of render thee proud or selfconfident let them not cause thee to forget we are but the creatures of a day existing we know not how and reserved forwe know not whatlet not the independence of thy fortune render thee unfeeling or inaccessible nor think that the accidental circumstances of birth and riches render it unnecessary for thee to abide by the strictest rules of virtue remember that in proportion to the elevation of thy rank thy inferiors will lookup to thee and therefore it becomes a moral obligation on thee to keep a guard over thy conduct so that no possible evil may be derived from thy example for thou wilt be hereafter responsible for whatever vices are imitated from thee and for whatever contamination thou mayest cause in the society of which thou art a member be not deluded with the ignoble idea that it is less incumbent on thee to be virtuous than those below thee for in proportion as thou hast power and scope for the commission of evil and the gratification of self so in proportion is thy merit in forbearance and a steady rectitude of conduct show glorious is it to live with dignity and decorumcicero to reign in the fiery wildness of the passions to place happiness in the highest perfection of which our nature is capable and to remember that we live to become worthy of a higher state than that which we at present move in overcome with pain and weakness the marchese suddenly ceased nor had his counsel been delivered but in a faltering voice broken every now and then from excess of anguish the exertion which from a principle of duty he forced himself to make struck forcibly to the heart of victoria the time was past midnight pale lamp emitted its faint rays over the spacious chamber and shewed the pallid features of her fathers that father whose love for her even in death taught him to despise his own agony the pause he had made was solemn and affecting the scene impressed her imagination and his words her mind while the silence the gloomy silence that reigned around was only interrupted by her sobs the wan hand of the marchese hung over the bedvictoria held it to her heart his dim eyes were fixed upon her with an expression of love and bitter regret soh my victoria thou wilt be unprotected he faintly said and a deep sigh rose from his heavy heart as dreadful recollections passed through his brain suddenly a noise was heard the door of the apartment flew open and in rushed no it was no delusionthe figure of laurina heaven do i behold aright feebly cried loredani endeavouring to raise himself in his bedor is death so near that already dim shadows the semblance of former friends hover before my eyes soh my godoh loredani my injured husbandbless me i implore oh you cannotyet forgiven forgive me ere you diecurse me not with your last breath so saying the frantic laurina threw herself prostrate on the ground by the side of the bed where lay her dying husband cut off by her guilt and misconduct in the flower of his life loredani succeeded for an instant in raising his head upon his hand a heavenly and celestial expression irradiated his features he gazed upon the prostrate wretch beside him with the look of a pitying angel then motioning to victoria he saidretire my child for a moment when she was withdrawn laurina said he in a low solemn voice arise she raised herself upon her knees but covered her face with her hands laurina said he again in the voice of a man who conscious he has not long to live desires to say nothing idlylaurina look upon me there was that in his manner which impelled obedience and the eyes of his guilty wife met his laurinait is yet in thy power to repair in some measure the evil thou hast donewhen i am laid in the grave seek out if possible thy sonthat son who fled his home on discovery of thy perfidyseek him and if it should please heaven that thou shouldst prove successful retire with him and thy daughter victoria far from venice for venice methinks is no longer </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> longer a place for thee endeavour to expiate by a life of penitence the great crimes thou hast been guilty of for dreadfully as thou hast marred the happiness and the honour of thy children perhaps it is not destroyed retire then to where thou art unknown and hereafter in the world they may claim consideration and respectful oh laurina tremble if thou returned to guilt and infamyeternal destruction then betides both thee and themthere is no redemptionnever will the impression of this night fade from the mind of victoria if thou wilt yet have courage and resolution to abandon thy guilty career and to instil into her mind by thy future example principles of virtue and honourlaurina unfortunate and onceloved wife thou wilt make thyself answerable by thy conduct not only for the life and future actions of thy daughter but for the fiat which will go forth respecting her when she renders up her great accountponder then well upon the mighty charge that by appearing before me at this awful moment thou brings upon thyselfyes on thy example oh thou who couldest desert thine innocent and lovely offspringon thy example will the life and conduct of thy daughter now be formed soh spare mespare me cried the wretched laurina in accents of despair i swear let my victoria enter said the marchese gasping for breath i have i have not a moment to live laurina rose and bade victoria enter as she approachedquick my child cried loredani hand embrace thy mother laurinavow swear to protect and cherish thy daughter to preserve her from evil and from the contamination of bad example i swear i swear articulated laurina in a voice drowned by sobs and pressed convulsively her daughter to her bosom victoriaswear murmured the marchese that thou wilt forget the errors and imitate the future virtues and example of thy mother i swear father in a solemn voice answered victoria soh godi thanktheethank thee gasped the dying loredani kiss me myvictoriamy thy hand laurina forgivethee oh godmy godi die content thus perished in the flower of his days the noble loredani the victim of a friends ingratitude and of a wifes depravity after the fatal rencontre of the illstarred marchese with ardolph the latter hurried as has been already observed from the spot having had sufficient time to escape from the scene of action and being of course completely unsuspected he reached by bye and circuitous ways his own house which having had occasion to return to venice he had hired for a short time only at some distance from the populous city under a feigned name hoping for the little while he had to remain completely to elude discovery from the injured loredanito return however when he entered the room where the apostate wife laurina was sitting she was struck with an appearance of sternness in his countenance and an unusual seriousness of manner approaching him and tenderly taking his handfor deep was the away the traitor had acquired over her he had betrayed she asked if aught had occurred to which she might attribute his altered looks pressing the hand which held his and looking steadily in her face he said laurina i have this night committed that which my heart condemns but which the necessity of the case enforced say only before i tell thee all that thou wilt not hate me for what involuntarily i have done hate thee passionately exclaimed the deluded wifei could not hate thee ardolph if thou hadst committed murder murder gloomily returned ardolph i hope not laurina but i have wounded i fear mortally thy husband a piercing shriek was the only answer of the horrorstruck laurina her avenging crimes flew in her facethey flashed like lightning through her brain she rushed from the presence of ardolph and flew as the resistless impulse of her frantic remorse dictated to the wellknown mansion of her martyred husband ardolph who merely imagined that she had flown from him impelled by the overflowing anguish of the moment suspected not till some hours had elapsed whither she had gone when at length however he surmised and ascertained the truth his rage and apprehensions knew no bounds for the passion with which the wretched laurina had first inspired him that fatal passion which in its consequences and progress was the cause of such immediate and such widespreading evils had not as yet subsided opposition too or difficulty could only tend in the breast of such a character as ardolph to give it strength and violence sooner at this period would he have endured death than her loss and he determined therefore whatever the chance of being suspected whatever the risk of being discovered to respect no sanctuary which could detain her from him nor permit her even to exist independently of himself for this purpose he completely disguised his person and wandering near the palazzo loredani now the mausoleum only of its once happy master resolved that from that spot he would never depart but with her whom he knew to be enclosed within its walls it was on the eve of the second day after the death of loredaniand laurina in the bitterness of remorseful anguish was weeping the consequences of her unhappy conductthat a letter was put into her hands upon opening it she found it to run as follows your present residence is no place for you having forfeited by a preference most gratefully recognised all title to act as the wife of the deceased loredani i would recommend it to you to depart from the place where you now are withall possible expedition the haughty relatives of the marchese will soon fill the house you will be considered as the boldest and most infamous of women and treated with all the ignominy that revenge and illiberality can dictate randolph laurina whose mind was </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> was still acutely smarting under the wounds inflicted by the last words of her husband and whose heart was deeply and sensibly impressed with a conviction of her unworthiness wrote without hesitation the following answer randolph dare my guilty heart admit the horrible acknowledgment that i love you stillyou whom my bewildered reason shews me at once a seducer and a murderer soh wretch that can cherish such sentimentsfor what am i reservedbut mark my determination it is to see you no morewith victoria the innocent sufferer for her mothers crimes it is my intention to quit immediately the roof under which i am i shall retire for a time into a remote province then when the remembrance of my infamy has ceased i shall again endeavour to mix with societynot for my own sake but for the sake of that daughter i have so cruelly wronged ask not therefore to see me for the request will be vaini dare not load with such a weight of guilt my blackened soul for ever farewel having dispatched these few lines by the messenger who still waited the wretched halfrepentant laurina expected with an agitation and horror of mind she vainly attempted to quell some further notice from the unworthy ardolph scarcely dared she acknowledge to herself the base the lurking hope that he would not so easily resign her with trembling frame then and mind of anarchy did she compel herself to prepare for speedy necessary departure from the roof of her husband where she felt with impunity she must not long remain an hour however had not elapsed since the departure of her letter before the same messenger returned with an answer an answer which to the eternal shame of laurina be it said conveyed to her breast a sensation of smothered unacknowledged delight equal at least to the irrepressible feelings of shame with which it was accompanied it ran thus you would retire from venice with your daughtermark me laurina with me there is no triflingleave at midnight your present abode and bring with you victoria on the canal opposite your window i shall await you you must go with me to monte bello the villa which i hired on my arrival here as a retreat during my necessary stay the situation is retired and distant from the city there we may remain free from suspicion for it is the opinion of every one that the marchese met his death by the hands of bravoes i have only this to addwhen there if you still continue to desire it i will myself accompany you to any seclusion you may point out and leave you there for ever unmolested let this however be fully understood between usi swear by every thing that is sacred and holy whether you accede or not to my present proposition you depart not unaccompanied by me from the city of venicethrough the world will i pursue you laurina for ever cross your path haunt you eternally if for a moment you dare hesitate or think to escape randolph from her variously agitated heart laurina heaved a deep and tremulous sigh essaying to believe herself irrecoverably fixed in the resoluteness of virtue and without daring farther to investigate the real workings of her mind she wrote as follows confident most cruel and invincible of mankindconfident that i shall live and die in the performance of my promise to i dare not write the name for my conscious beating heart unnerves my fingers i accede to your proposition and trustsince i mustto your honour for the performance of your promise thus far being arranged the weak and misguided laurina again commenced her preparationsbut ah with renewed alacrity for though undefined perhaps by herself her sensations were those produced by a conviction of still being loved and still being seen once more by him whom of all men she should have shunned and abhorred such such is the picture too often of a guilty human heart at midnight laurina accompanied by victoria left the palazzo loredani the determined ardolph was punctual to his appointment he received them with a proud seriousness and conducting them to a gondola which he had in waiting they speedily arrived at monte bello it is not necessary to enlarge upon this incidental part of our history suffice it that arrived at his villa the seductive ardolph called to his aid all those dangerous and seductive blandishments which already had been the cause of so much guilt and mischief and successfully too successfully he called them the wretched laurina yielded at first to the delay of a few hours under the roof of the unprincipled betrayer and well he knew how to improve this short delay for what man having once corrupted the heart and principles of the woman he deludes has ever found it difficult to maintain his victory if he thought it worth his while most literally indeed did ardolph keep his conditional promise that laurina should have free liberty to depart if still she continued to wish it unhappy wretch she wished it not for blinded by the fascinations of her lover she found it impossible to live but in his presence gradually and imperceptibly their intercourse now doubly criminal became dearer and more strongly cemented than ever yet was the wretched farce of journeying in various directions and even to considerable distances under the pretext of discovering some suitable situation for the young victoria and her deluded mother steadily persevered in for did not ardolph know that change of scene was conducive to the plans he had in view of restraining from compunctious reflection the mind of laurina and by so ordering that in his society she should experience no moment of melancholy make her view with horror the idea of abandoning him and secure her entirely to himself the plans of ardolph </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> ardolph ever well arranged rarely failed of success infatuated by his seductions laurina sought eagerly sought to evade reflection and as a wretch writhing with pain flies to the relief of opium so did laurina from the pangs of conscience to the soothing and intoxicating presence of him who destroyed her for could she ever endure the secret horrible conviction of her guiltthat she had rushed from the deathbed of her husbandfrom where his sainted spirit still lingered to the very arms of his murdererthat she had forfeited her solemn vow which his soul had tarried to hear sworncould she even with all the aid of sophistry attempt to seek in her own mind a palliation of thisshe had no resource then but in ardolph in his eyes she idolatrously beheld an excuse for her crimes and in his fascinating voice was recorded a temptation she imagined no heart could have resisted gradual and terrible are the approaches of vice the only absolute original imperfection of laurina was vanity and love of admiration this error trifling when in a dormant state but dangerous when improperly called forth of what a catalogue of dreadful evils did it not become the causewhat awful mischiefs had not already ensued should not this lesson then be conveyed to the mindthat the propensity of our natures to evil should be vigilantly checked and that the guard which should be constantly kept over the wanderings of the heart should never be suffered to slumber on its post a year had now elapsed since the death of loredani the melancholy events which had characterised that period had become fainter and fainter in the mind of laurina the journies of enquiry had long since ceased and on the subject of her departure from the society of ardolph the perjured wife no more expatiated they did not reside in the city of venice but still at monte bello some few miles distant for the circumstances still unforgotten with which their names were connected would have caused them to be viewed with disdain and indignation by the higher classes of society they remained therefore at their villa and thither contrived to attract most of the dissolute and many of the thoughtless inhabitants of venice for the aggregate of the world will run even into the very dens of profligacy for amusement as ina few individuals alone is it vested to bethe censors of vice monte bello resounded to the voice of mirth and folly reflection appeared to be banished and those events which should have been engraved in characters of blood upon the hearts of its inmates appeared rapidly sinking into oblivion or to be remembered only with indifference it happened that among the gay venetians who frequented their society was one called il conte berenza he was a man of peculiar sentiments and extraordinary character he came not to monte bello in search of amusement nor merely from indolence he came from an investigating spirit to analyse its inhabitants and to discover if possible from the result of his own observation whether the mischief they had caused and the conduct they pursued arose from a selfish depravity of heart or was induced by the force of inevitable circumstances he came to investigate character and to increase his knowledge of the human heart he found however or fancied that he found but little to interest the consideration of the liberal philosopher in the relative situations of ardolph and laurina he concluded in his mind that they had voluntarily rushed into evil and had possessed the power to have withdrawn themselves in time from the dangerous vortexhe therefore viewed them with contempt and dislike unmixed with the slightest portion of pityhe beheld wretches who had studied alone their own gratification wholly unmindful of the mischiefs they might cause in its atchievement under this impression he regarded with eyes of no common interest the young victoria pride alone forbade his soliciting her hand for never yet had berenza beheld a female whose character he had imagined so formed to constitute his happiness nay so ardent in his admiration was the misguided philosopher misguided in this instancethat had so dishonour in his idea been attached to the unfortunate girl he would have made her his wife upon speculation and relied upon the power he believed himself to possess over the human mind for modelling her afterwards so as perfectly to assimilate to his wishes her wild and imperious character he would have essayed to render noble firm and dignified her fiert he would have softened and her boldness checked berenza knew not so unconscious is the heart of man of the springs of its own movements that it was the graceful elegant form and animated countenance of victoria that led him to form of her stronglymarked character the best and most flattering estimate she was at this period about seventeen the age of berenza was five and thirty his person was majestic and his countenance though serious possessed a sweetness of expression that riveted and delighted the eye but it was not this so much that engaged the attentions and allured the fancy of the young victoria no it was the flattering remark that herself exclusively attracted his regards regards which the natural haughtiness and apparent coldness of his character rendered peculiarly gratifying to her vain mind it was for this she sought his society and courted his notice till berenza wound almost to a pitch of enthusiasm scarcely lived but in the hope of calling her his attachments his philosophic mind had none excepting to a brother some years younger than himself who was at this time absent from italy to divert the melancholy of an almost hopeless passion his thoughts and wishes therefore centered in victoria with undivided ardour it may naturally be supposed that the character of victoria by nature more prone to </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> to evil than to good and requiring at once the strong curb of wisdom and example to regulate it had not since the death of her father obtained much opportunity of improvement she saw exemplified in the conduct of her mother the flagrant violation of a most sacred oathshe saw every principle of delicacy and of virtue apparently contemned and although the improper bias of her mind led her infinitely to prefer the gay though horrible state of degradation in which she lived to the retirement and seclusion so strongly insisted on by the dying marchese yet had she reflection and discrimination enough fully to perceive and condemn the flagitious disregard those dying commands had received but victoria was a girl of no common feelingsher ideas wildly wandered and to every circumstance and situation she gave rather the vivid colouring of her own heated imagination than that of truth berenza had awakened in her breast feelings and passions which had till now remained dormant mighty and strong like the slumbering lion even in their inactivity slight indeed was the spur which they required to rouse them she had ever contemplated the seductive and in appearance delightful union of her mother with ardolph with such sentiments as were at the time inexplicable to herself but when berenza singled her out when he addressed her in the language of love she then discovered that her sentiments were those of envy and of an ardent consuming desire to be situated like that unhappy motherlike her to receive the attentions listen to the tenderness and sink beneath the ardent glances of a lover such such were the baleful effects of parental vice upon the mind of a daughter a mind that required the strongest power of precept and virtuous conduct to correct it nat length then with secret exultation she exclaimedat length i too have found a lovers shall now be as happy as my mother at least if berenza should love me as count ardolph loves her but it happened that the heart of berenza had acquired a real passion while that of victoria was susceptible only of novel and seducing sensational anticipations of future pleasure berenza loved victoria was only roused and flattered upon consideration but not certainly impartial consideration the enamoured philosopher concluded that it would not be an act of baseness or guilt to withdraw victoria from her present dangerous and ineligible situations acknowledge his passion to her and induce her if possible to abandon the contaminated roof under which she resided the pride of the venetian however must have been stronger than his love for it rejected the idea of making her his wife while he determined to leave no means untried to cause her to become his mistress pursuant to this idea he sought the earliest opportunity of obtaining a private interview with victoria an opportunity early presented itself and having declared to his delighted arbitress the ardent love with which she had inspired him he delicately but frankly proposed to her the plan upon which he had for some time past suffered himself to dwell enraptured the boldly organised mind the wild and unrestrained sentiments of victoria prevented her from being offended at the proposition of berenza had she for an instant conceived that his strict ideas deemed her incapable of being legally his she must with all her desire for a lover have spurned him indignantly from her but pride here acted as the preservative of pride and her vanity easily led her to believe that berenza thought marriage a degrading and unnecessary tie to love like his under this impression she gave him her hand berenza seized it with ardour as the earnest of consent and seating himself at the feet of his mistress who smiled with high and unusual joy he entered more fully into his arrangements and the means by which be proposed she should quit monte bello unsuspected victoria listened with lively emotions pleasure flushed triumphant her animated cheek and shone in her wild eyes with an almost painful brilliancy her heart glowed with the love of enterprize she felt capable of deeds which though in their conception they dilated and seduced her soul she could neither comprehend nor identify but she felt inspired for action and the enthusiasm which burnt in her bosom lighted up every feature with lambent and etherial fire suddenly in the very midst of her felicitations while berenza still at her feet was pouring in her intoxicated ears his various plans for their future happiness in rushed rage and horror depicted in her countenance the half frantic laurina wretch she exclaimed seizing violently the arm of victoriawretch is it thus you recompence my indulgence towards youth fond the foolish confidence which your mother has ever placed in youand you signor berenza monster of depravity is it thus you recompence the hospitality of count ardolph in seeking to seduce our only happiness the innocent victoria signora replied berenza with a disdainful smile you are indeed well qualified to arraign those who trample on the rights of hospitality the eyes of the consciencestruck laurina sought for an instant the grounded countenance became suffused with a guilty blushher heart beat with violence and scarcely could she support her trembling frame berenza with dignified calmness took the hand of victorian do not he continued in a firm deliberate voice i do not plead guilty to the charge of attempting to seduce your daughter i wish he added in a severe accent sto save her from seduction pardon me if i say that under this roof i conceive it inevitably awaits her victoria cried laurina recovering from her agitation but awed by the manner of berenza from replying to him victoria i command you to leave the roomyes for the first time in my life i command you never more to hold converse with il </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> il conte berenza berenza fixed his proud and enquiring eyes upon the countenance of victoria whether she caught a spark of the fire which emanated from them or thus for the first time asserted the bold and independent sentiments of her bosom is immaterial but withdrawing proudly her hand from berenza as though she needed not his aid and advancing a few steps towards her mother she thus replied that you never signora commanded me till now is true that you command me now when it is too late is equally so i determine to quit this roof which is no protection to me for that of il route berenza which i trust will be soh victoriavictoriaart thou mad exclaimed laurina clasping her hands and now beginning to feel the terrible commencement of those retributive pangs so justly ordained as the punishment of those parents who corrupt their childrenart thou mad my child or wouldst thou voluntarily plunge me in eternal disgrace plunge you in disgrace contemptuously returned victoria soh my child my child cried the distracted mother sinking under the overpowering excess of remorseful anguish wouldst thou indeed abandon me you abandoned memy brother and my father sternly replied the torturing victoria soh daughteroh victoria groaned laurinathis from thee mothereternally hast thou disgraced us she replied for me no one has ever thought me worthy of love but il conte berenza let me then accept his love and be happy why i ask you should considerations of your happiness sway me in opposition to my own when you loved count ardolph you know mother that you fled with him regardless of the misery you gave my father do you not remember too cease scorpioncease for gods sake shrieked laurina in agony let me then depart with il conte berenza remember it is your fault pursued the pitiless girl that ever i saw him had you but kept the oaththe oath mother thatthat you swore at the deathbed of my father the images conjured up by the forked tongue of a reproaching child were too much even for the guilty laurina to endure and in a convulsion of irrepressible anguish she sunk upon the floor berenza who had at first listened with delight and surprize to the independence of spirit as he considered it evinced by the undaunted victoria now became visibly shocked at her persevering and remorseless cruelty to a mother whose personal tenderness for her had at least merited some little gratitude scarcely willing to analyse if his love for her had not already somewhat diminished by the display of a trait so offensive to a delicate and feeling mind as filial ingratitude and unkindness he approached and raised laurina from the floor when she became in a degree recovered he assisted her with respectful forbearance to her chamber and whispering to victoria in rather a serious voice to be tender towards her mother retired and left them together but the slight shade of reserve which marked the countenance of berenza ashe waved his hand to victoria in parting had not failed to make even more than its due impression on her her vivid imagination easily led her to trace the occasion of his altered air she saw that her cruel recriminations on her mother had excited his disgust alarmed at the remotest idea of becoming indifferent to him she instantly determined on regaining his esteem approaching her weeping mother therefore with a conciliating air she endeavoured to soothe her into composure but having awakened the remorse of the conscious laurina she no sooner beheld in the artful victoria a disposition to softness than she resolved to take immediate advantage of it to withdraw her if possible from the vortex of guilt and libertinism into which she saw her plunging a keener pang assailed the heart of the mother as she acknowledged in dreadful conviction the fatal effects of her own example to alleviate therefore the tortures of her mind to save her loaded conscience from such an addition of guilt she sought with energy to preserve her daughter to every persuasion however even to every supplication to give up her distracting resolution without reserve the wild impassioned victoria was wholly deaf the utmost that laurina could obtain was a reluctant promise to see il conte berenza no more for that day even this would not have been granted had not the deeplymeaning victoria imagined that by debarring her lover from seeing her for a few hours he would begin so far to feel the loss of her society as wholly to forget in his uneasiness the cause he had had for displeasure against her laurina after some hours of more poignant wretchedness than she had almost ever experienced separated at length for the night from her daughter she flew instantly to ardolph and imparted to him this new and unexpected cause to her of unhappiness so keen indeed were her compunctious feelings that with bitter tears she vowed she would quit him on the morrow and retire at once with victoria to some seclusion where experience now convinced her she ought long since to have been ardolph listened without interruption when laurina paused he looked at her with tender seriousness and said that a union like ours laurina cemented by ties and by circumstances which however they may be considered by the prejudiced and misjudging nothing should have the power of annulling that such an union should either be innovated or destroyed by the impudent caprice of a forward girl admits not of a thought listen to what i have to propose and let victoria as she ought reap the fruits of her audacity it would be easy for me to forbid il conte berenza to remain here another houris would be easy to imprison victoria in her chamber and prevent them seeing each other but we shall have recourse </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> recourse to no compulsory measures on the contrary to such only as shall be at once simple cool and effective it is most probable that il conte berenza has never had occasion to correspond with your daughter he is therefore ignorant of her handwriting do you then draw up a few lines suppose to the following effect dear berenza owing to the unhappiness manifested by my mother i have agreed to deny myself for a little time the pleasure of seeing you i therefore entreat of you to return to venice and when the effect produced by present circumstances shall in some degree have worn off i will gladly write to you to returns let these or a few similar lines be conveyed at once to berenza and you will find the effect produced will be an immediate and voluntary absence from hence the instant he departs for venice victoria shall quit this abode without me do you mean ardolph we will both escort her hence laurina and she shall be too securely lodged ever more to interrupt our happinessand now that an idea strikes me he hastily added perceiving that laurina was on the point of speaking and determined to drown her objections i have an admirable seclusion for her in our excursions last year laurina we made at one time a short stay as you doubtless call to mind with your cousin the signora di modena she resides i think near treviso nothing can be more retired more fitted for victoria than her abode the signora di modena was singularly polite and courteous towards me smiling as he spoke come come my laurina no objections but on this matter we will talk furthermean time should even berenza finding that he is not recalled by his mistress venture hither we can receive him with marked coolness when he no longer perceives the loadstar of his attraction he will naturally conceive that we have purposely withdrawn her and having certainly no claim to an explanation he will speedily and in chagrin desert us thus he added in a gayer tone shall we be rid of every source of trouble and uneasiness and thus my beloved you perceive there is no immediate necessity for separating the soul from the body to tear yourself from me to whom your are more even than soulno we must not bend to circumstances we must make them subservient to us no human being nor any consideration on earth he added in an emphatic voice must now laurina separate thee and me but come resuming the gaiety of his manner sto business laurina mechanically took up a pen and as ardolph dictated traced something similar to what has been already given the letter finished it was conveyed to berenza by a female servant of laurinas who was ordered not to wait for any answer the feelings of berenza as he read characters which he never for a moment doubted had been traced by the hand of victoria were such as to the line of conduct they instigated him to adopt highly favourable to the views of count ardolph but berenza was not displeased by the perusal nay it is uncertain if he had not even a contrary sentiment for he believed that victorias declining to see him for a short time was merely an atonement offered by her for her recent misconduct to an insulted and wounded mother as such therefore he felt with genuine goodness disposed to concede to her idea and believing that his departure might assist to establish that harmony which his presence had interrupted and which it was absolutely requisite to the ultimate atchievement of his own wishes should be restored he determined to lose no time but to quit monte bello at once for the purpose of being enabled to return to it hereafter with better prospects of success he experienced too something like a sensation of pleasure that victoria should evince remorse for the pain she had inflicted upon a doting parent and perceiving in addition that a prompt departure would avoid some unpleasant and perhaps very serious explanation with count ardolph he called instantly under the impression of these ideas for his servant and ordered him to get ready for returning to venice he had indeed a slight inclination to leave a line for victoria but upon reflection thinking it might only tend to irritate laurina against him he determined to dispense even with this and all being very soon prepared for his short journey with a bright italian sky sparkling over his head and the moon to light him on his way il conte berenza bade adieu to monte bello on the following morning laurina entered the bedchamber of her daughter and after some slight conversation informed her in a tone of affected surprize of the departure of berenza the intelligence for an instant gave to the haughty bosom of victoria a pang of acute mortification but this emotion was speedily succeeded by one of violent and uncontrouled rage looking fiercely at her mother she said nil conte berenza went not willingly from hence at whose instigation was he driven to depart not at the instigation of any one victoria mildly but falteringly replied laurina victoria withdrew her keen eyes from the countenance of her mother and in a musing but stern voice said if il conte berenza departed voluntarily he will rest passive and take no measures to see me but if he was impelled hence then will he write to me and inform me of the truth thus even at all events will the mystery be cleared up hand in the mean time cruel girl said laurina who had been accurately tutored by ardolph hand in the meantime we to amuse ourselves will plan an excursion somewhere from the air of innocence so well assumed by laurina the unbending </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> unbending victoria almost believed it real she relaxed into a smile and half soothed half angry she suffered her mother to take her hand when are we to depart and whither are we to go she haughtily enquired we shall depart if you do not object my love almost immediately mildly returned laurina hand it is the wish of count ardolph that we should pay first a visit to the signora di modena at her delightful retreat il bosco near treviso what to that forbidding formal old creature sullenly muttered victoria come my love she is a relation you know there however we need only remain a few days and afterwards our little tour shall be prescribed by victoria victoria deigned a haughty smile her mother tenderly pressed the hand she still held and rising said adieu for the present my love prepare as i am going to do for our departure not unpleasing was this request to victoria for her wounded pride now again usurping the place of regret and love surely thought she had berenza really loved me he would not so coolly so suddenly have departed without leaving even a line no perhaps he began to imagine that by persevering in the plan he had intended he might become involved in some embarrassment or inconvenience therefore if even his departure was not voluntary no doubt he readily embraced the slightest hint to disentangle himself from his engagement with me can he then be worthy of regret and yet i may wrong him perhapssome combined artifice some circumstances of which i am not aware but i will not reflect let time for time only can convince me with an unsettled mind and an heart ill at ease victoria began to arrange a few things for her departure she was not suffered by the count or laurina to remain long in solitude the nurse too often of dangerous reflection they entered her chamber together and in a gay unembarrassed tone ardolph enquired if she was ready i am was the laconic answer of victoria then so are we said he and took her hand to lead her from the room with coolness but without anger the proud girl withdrew her hand and followed them in silence from the apartment ardolph who resolved that no danger should arise from delay had caused everything to be prepared they embarked therefore immediately for treviso on the terra firma and victoria though she little dreamt it at the time bade a long adieu to venice every attempt at conversation was for some time baffled by the sullen taciturnity of victoria but by degrees perhaps from a feeling of shame at the idea of being thought to regret a man who after all might have voluntarily abandoned her her sullenness relaxed and she determined to assume a chearfulness that she was far from feeling this change delighted laurina so powerfully indeed did it affect her misguided heart that she even began to repent the precipitancy of her conduct and to feel some pangs at the idea of immuring in a disgusting solitude a young creature who but for the mischievous tendency of her own example might have been rendered to society a value and an ornament ardolph read in her eyes the increasing softness of her heart and that her purpose wavered she even ventured to cast towards him a look expressive of her feelings but he whose aim it was to remove every barrier to his continued possession of laurina instantly by a stern look of the most unshaken resolution convinced her every attempt would be vain to alter his purpose laurina sighed for the eyes of ardolph had told her there was nothing to hope she sunk into painful thought and it now became the task of victoria to rally her mother and to shew vain girl how far she could conquer her feelings and become mistress of herself her every endeavour however but added to the compunction of mind experienced by the unhappy laurina as they had departed from venice at a late hour it was dusk when they reached treviso and arrived at il bosco which was so named from its situation in the midst of a wood its gloomy appearance however did not depress victoria who was by this time absolutely in spirits the mothers heart was rived she knew it was the intention of ardolph after her relation should be instructed as to the conduct it was his wish she should pursue towards victoria laying infinite stress upon the levity and freedom of her principles to abandon her solely to the guardianship of this person with whom even laurina herself had never been much in the habit of associating she therefore ardently longed to alter the severe resolution of the unyielding ardolph but the effort she knew would be vain with him she could atchieve nothing when not under the immediate apprehension of losing her divested of that he became stern unrelenting and inaccessible which was indeed his natural character to have obtained from him a remission of the sentence she should have begun earlier before even her departure from monte bello now having gone so far to suppose he would retract was supposing impossibilities in vain she anxiously examined his countenance she saw there nothing buta complacent cool expression the result of a settled purpose in the mind the signora di modena welcomed count ardolph with all the warmth she could command laurina anxiously examined her countenance to see if she could augur aught of kindness or gentleness to reconcile her to her guardianship of her daughter but in the frigid features of this forbidding female nothing was discernible but the austere pride of ungracious virtue with an aukward attempt at condescending kindness which shewed how much it cost her to assume acquainted with the unhappy misconduct of laurina and </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> and likewise that it had lost her her place in society she with the arrogated superiority of little minds ever triumphing in the fall of others contented herself with a solemn curtsey towards her while on victoria she scarcely deigned to glance the signora di modena as has been already observed was distantly related to laurina she was not more repulsive in person than in character a long yellow visage small grey eyes and a stiff unbending meagre figure constituted the former she was proud fastidious and possessed of a mercenary soul from her youth alarmed at the idea of conventual seclusion yet being portionless as the daughters of the italian nobility frequently are she preferred residing an occasional dependant in such noble families as would permit her lengthened visits where she would act alternately the overseer the companion the governess or the servant by these and other winding paths by flattery peculation and hypocrisy she had actually amassed as the friendless period of age approached sufficient to make it pass with comfort though not with affluence and to recompense herself for the contempt she had in her early life experienced becoming as far as she could the torment and scourge of all who were miserable enough to be subject to her controul no man even in the best of her days had ever glanced toward her with the eye of admiration much less attempted to solicit her in marriage and for this reason her bitterness against all females who could attract or dare to yield to the regards of the other sex knew no bounds and they could hope from her no mercy such was the signora di modena whose self interest would not permit her to quarrel with laurina because though she had never much associated with her she had often proved herself a generous friend towards her still her wretched affectation and rancorous envy would not suffer her to display much warmth no such reason however operated in her conduct to ardolph of him she was desirous to make a friend and hence her mercenary homage was directed towards him and she paid him chiefs court he had not therefore entirely jested when he had remarked to laurina the courtesy of the signora toward him on a former visit nothing however could excite in him a desire to prolong his stay beyond what was necessary under her roof he therefore presuming upon her uncommon deference towards him requested an early supper that victoria might then retire and he might be enabled to enter at once upon the grand object of their visit supper was at length announced and the unsuspecting victoria detesting the the very looks of the old signora which had already succeeded in damping her spirits requested to be shewn to her chamber as soon as it was concluded beneath her stern and scrutinizing regard her haughty mind felt a sentiment of impatient disgust and an oppression never known before to the buoyant carelessness of her disposition on bidding her mother good night she felt impelled from the very uneasiness she experienced to throw her arms round her neck with unusual affection and whispered to her that she hoped they should not long remain under so gloomy and ungenial a roof scarcely could the anguished mother reply her heart smote her for her deception and conscience whispered to her truths that brought the blood into her cheeks she however pressed the hand of victoria and faultered out good night while the reflection that it might be perhaps be for the last time filled her bosom with acute pain and her eyes with tears victoria left the room almost reproaching herself for having ever pained a heart of such fond sensibility as her mothers she was scarcely gone ere the impatient ardolph turning towards the signora di modena entered abruptly upon the business he was most desirous of accomplishing will you signora he began hallow me to say a few words to you the signora stiffly bowed endeavouring to smile graciously but succeeding only in a ghastly distortion of feature the well bred ardoph however took it for a smile of acquiescence and thus proceeded your courtesy and politeness to me signora and above all the high opinion i entertain of your character induce me to place in you a confidence i could not certainly repose in any other females am to inform you then that the young girl who has just left the apartment i am desirous to commit for a certain period to your care naturally evil disposed of a haughty and audacious temper she has been nearly by flattery and indulgence destroyed her ideas are entirely corrupted and child as you may think her for she is scarcely eighteen there have not been wanting those of the other sex who have sought to undermine her principleshere the signora heaved a loud tremulous sigh and turning up her eyes to heaven made the holy sign of the cross the count with external gravity and secret contempt proceeded what i would therefore presume to request of you is that you will condescend to keep over this proud and forward girl so strict a watch as scarcely to suffer her ever from your sight but do not do not treat her severely dear cousin interrupted laurina with a faultering voice the immaculate signora replied only by a cool halfscornful look and scarcely seemed proud of the appellation which laurina had given her though once it was the chief boast of her little mind she now thought herself superior to the fallen wife of loredani i would have you signora continued ardolph endeavouring to call back her attention to himself i would have you confine her if it be necessary to the solitude of her chamber for a short time soh ardolph cried laurina unable to command her feelings you </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> you are too cruel there can be no occasion for such harshness another look from the unbending signora chilled her into silence who then turned again with the utmost deference towards the count laurina you are no judge coldly observed ardolph the signora will only act as circumstances may require to her conduct and discretion you may safely commit your daughter when by a due course he pursued looking towards the signora nos restraint and privation of every incitement to evil a change for the better shall be perceptible in her disposition we will withdraw her hence and you laurina may again receive her mean time signora di modena it is my intention to depart early tomorrow morning from this place leaving victoria still asleep when she arises astonished at not seeing us she will enquire of you respecting us you will then gently disclose to her the truth and her own destination for the present by degrees you will i doubt not reconcile her to what she will perceive to be inevitable deign to act in this affair signora with that zeal and punctuality which your piety will teach you to exert for the salvation of a soul and with that prudence which has hitherto appeared so eminently to distinguish your own conduct in life in which case allow me to add you shall not find me ungrateful again a smile which appeared hideous because it seemed unnatural to the hard features it dilated was the return for this last significant remark of the counts he had skilfully touched the spring the only spring upon which any feeling or any principle of the signora hunginterest she found as she had all along imagined that it was her interest to court and to oblige the count she therefore determined to yield to whatever he should require fondly promising herself in return some splendid remuneration be assured my lord count she said in a grating discordant voice intended to be gentle and conciliating i will observe your wishes to the uttermost and as for you signora laurina looking towards her with a pitying air for all i intend to observe my lord counts wishes you shall not have any reason to complain of the treatment your daughter will receive at these words the grateful laurina flew towards her and seizing her hand which she fervently pressed she said soh you have no child my dear signora yet pity the feelings of a mother and be kind to mine she has never no never been opposed nor treated with harshness hastily and with a look almost amounting to horror the pure and dignified signora withdrew her hand as from the touch of pollution then rising and retreating three steps stretching out her arm at full length to prevent the nearer approach of so sinful and impure a being she said i will do the duty of a good catholic towards your child i shall study the preservation of her soul and more her spiritual interest than her temporal vanities the conscious and abashed laurina turned aside with shame even from the shew of virtue in its most ungraceful form pride and affection there appears no occasion for further discourse observed ardolph coldly we shall rely upon the proper tenor of your conduct towards victoria when we think that time and reflection shall have shewn her her faults and taught her to amend them we will visit you again if we find her sufficiently improved in her character we shall receive her once more mean time cousin di modena goodnight have the goodness to direct that we may be awakened early for the purpose of commencing our journey homewards before sunrise and that you may bear us in mind till our return deign to accept this ring as a small token of the respect we cherish towards you so saying ardolph took from his finger a magnificent ring which he placed on one of the signoras whose halfclosed eyes had more than once been rivetted upon it then gallantly bowing on her withered hand he withdrew leaving her in admiration at his singular politeness and her own dexterity as she thought in having turned him already to such good account pursuant to his determination long ere the sun had risen ardolph with his weeping and remorseful companion were far from the villa ii bosco perceiving however that laurina was not yet reconciled to the prompt and severe measures he had so obstinately pursued he forbore for the present to touch upon the subject though his heart exulted to think that what he willed he executed and that nothing now could intervene to deprive him of a woman whom his pride equally at least with his love made him so desirous of retaining had no obstacles ever existed to his possession of her and even to his retaining her afterwards the depraved and cruel ardolph had either never sought or long since have disdained her but his passion and his pride kept in continual alarms gave a renewed vividness to feelings which but for such excitements would have sunk into apathy or disgust such was the vitiated mind of ardolph that he could taste no delight that possessed not the poignant zest of having caused misery or destruction to others innocent and easily acquired pleasures suited not his profligate soul beauty to him was but a slight attraction if not surrounded with difficulty and shielded either by the doting fondness of a husband or cherished as the glory of an admiring family such had been the situation when he first beheld her of the unfortunate and now degraded laurina of her whom he beheld himself as he proudly thought in the future undisturbed possession of even till she should outlive if such could be his present love and admiration of hernia such could be oh then laurina </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> laurina in bitterness of heart lightest thou curse the hours when first thou wert seen by the cruel and insensible ardolph those feelings so base yet not unparalleled in the nature of man which actuated the mind of ardolph gave an elation to his spirits which dispensed itself in a brilliant animation over his fine features and ever fascinating manners without alluding to the cause of laurinas grief he contrived by the most gentle and tender blandishments gradually to dispel it such a seducing influence did he still possess over her ruined mind that there were moments when she literally forgot there was a being in the world but himself when she listened to his attractive converse and gazed on the dignified beauty of his form she felt rising in her breast a sentiment of that vanity which had already proved her destruction she even conceived towards him such was her infatuation an increase of love and gratitude when she reflected that it was the unbounded ardour of his attachment to her which had induced him to act with severity towards any one who had sought to embitter it thus even the sacrifice of her child sacrificed at the shrine of her errors and her crimes by him who had been the cause of all she began to contemplate with emotions of less poignant regret scarcely could she grieve in earnest at any thing which bound closer to her the object offer idolatrous love it seemed as if every occurrence which should have made her view him with sentiments of horror but increased the delusion of her soul each moment that carried her further from the child she had abandoned effaced more and more her image from her mind her ideas became more strongly rivetted upon him whose artifices had rendered her an infamous wife and a cruel mother while himself was the exclusive charm of her unhappy existence let us leave then for a time this guilty pair to enjoy the society of each other and return to the deserted victoria when she awakened and looked round the large and desolate chamber which the ill light afforded by a lamp on the preceding night had prevented her from viewing the first feeling of her mind was renewed disgust against the owner of the mansion and an impatient hope that the count and her mother would not prolong their stay under a roof so hateful finding however that no one attended to call her and imagining she must have slept many hours the morning appeared to be far advanced she arose and dressing herself hastily descended from her chamber and entered the garden here she had not been long before she beheld advancing towards her a short muscular looking girl habited in the costume of a peasant she approached victoria and informed her that the signora di modena desired her company at breakfast with a haughty supercilious air and a smile of derision on her features victoria glanced over the figure of the humble girl and without deigning a reply preceded her into the house entering the apartment where breakfast was laid she saw there seated alone at the table the old signora in unbending state without even offering to her the customary salutations of the morning the haughty victoria enquired impatiently if count ardolph and her mother still slept i think it improbable coolly returned the signora why are they not here then pursued the offended girl in a quick tone because answered the signora with malicious and illdisguised exultation they must by this time i imagine be some way on their journey from hence gone almost shrieked victoria did you say gone i said so with unaltered countenance carelessly returned the signora his there any thing so dreadful young lady in being compelled to remain with me for a while come be charitable she tauntingly proceededi have been long very solitary and you will be noble company for me i think the rage of victoria knew no bounds she gazed wildly round the apartment the whole truth rushed through her mind at oncethe base the unpardonable artifice that had been usedshe struck her head violently with her clenched hand and passionately exclaimingi am deceived and entrapped rushed from the room before the signora was aware of her intention and reaching the apartment where she had slept she secured the door there casting herself upon the floor her passion vented itself in a violent paroxysm of tears but becoming suddenly ashamed of yielding as she thought it to a weakness so ignoble and angry with herself that the ill treatment of any one should have power to excite in her either grief or lamentation she checked a rising gush while rage and the most deadly hatred against those who had thus dared to dupe and to betray her took possession of her swelling heart an ardent desire of revenge followed and thus from the conduct misjudging and inexcusable that had been pursued towards her did every violent and evil propensity of her nature become increased and aggravated no sooner had victoria called to her aid the loftier and more dangerous passions than she became to appearance calm and though now and then when reflecting upon the deception of her mother and cold deliberate artifice of ardolph her eyes shot fire and the pulsation of her heart increased yet in her general aspect there were no longer traces of grief but on the contrary a superior and dignified expression which would have done honour to a nobler motive her head no longer drooped and rising hastily from the floor on which after her first paroxysm she had remained sitting with firm and measured step she traversed the apartment to and fro in the course of her cooler reflection it occurred to her that il conte berenza must have been impelled by artifice and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> and not his own desire to quit monte bello this idea soothed the sovereign pride of her bosom she felt that her charms had not been slighted and at some future period she did not yet despair of convincing him that the separation was neither on her side voluntary but then she recurred to her present situationwas it intended she should remain for ever a prisoner in this gloomy abode again she yielded for a moment to the influence of circumstance and her heart became chilled at the idea yes she determined to observe minutely to make no enquiriesto betray no vexation but to act precisely as events might shew necessary soothed and calmed by these mental arrangements and by the victory which reason as she conceived had obtained over her weaker feelings she resolved as evening drew on to quit the solitude of her chamber and breathe for a short space the air of the garden for the whole of the day she had not tasted food and though she heeded not the calls of hunger she became sensible of the privation the cold and unfeeling signora happy to have a human being and above all an ardent and highspirited creature to tyrannise over resolved that no refreshment should be offered her till she herself came and with proper apologies for her conduct requested it but of this victoria formed not the remotest intention and it is probable that rather than have done so she would have fallen a victim to the pangs of hunger fortunately for her however though infinitely to the regret of the tantalising signora she was not put to this trial having walked for a while in the garden and refreshed her wearied faculties with the dewy fragrance of the atmosphere she entered the house and proceeded though unintentionally to the very apartment where supper was prepared there quietly seating herself opposite to the old signora she partook without ceremony of what was before her she even made some attempt at conversation but foiled in her proposed plan of ungenerous mortification the signora di modena was too vexed to make any reply she had hoped to have found her inmate stubborn refractory and violent giving fine scope thereby to her favourite art of tormenting how grieved and disappointed then was she to find the fury of the morning sunk into calm and as it appeared patient submission victoria perceiving the signora determined upon sullen silence requested permission to withdraw for the night in a tone of the utmost politeness the only answer she obtained was a stiff inclination of the head more determined than ever at this that she should not have the gratification of provoking her she coolly rose and wishing her with a profound curtsey good night left the room when she was gone this worthy and pious catholic began to reflect that by means like these victoria would escape from all the arrangements she had been making to punish and mortify her this will never do she cried while ruminating how best she might vex and harass the mind of her unfortunate guest she has become reconciled to her situation without any attempt on my side to render her so but she shall not escape thusi will break that proud spirit and make her submit afterwards such were the reflections of the charitable devotee and with these thoughts at work in her brain for the comfort and happiness of others she said a long prayer during which she frequently struck her breast and retired to repose victoria after sitting for an hour at the window with a mind still persevering in the resolution to be firm sought likewise her bed and soon forgot the vexations of the day in slumber on the following morning she awakened at an early hour and after having drest herself she prepared to pass from her chamber into the garden trying her door she found it was fastened on the outside and discovering soon that every attempt on her part to shake it must be ineffectual she opened the window and stationed herself beside it in about half an hour the door was unlocked and the young muscular girl already mentioned entered the room with a bowl of milk and a slice of coarse bread these she laid upon the table and was retiring come back imperiously cried victoria the girl sullenly turned half round i chuse to walk in the garden she pursued the signora will not permit gruffly returned the girl will not permit repeated victoria no laconically answered the girl again laying her hand upon the lock of the door why do you leave these things behind you cried victoria smothering the rage she felt rising in her breast nit is your breakfast replied the girl quitting the room and locking the door after her so then i am made a prisoner muttered victoria and her cheeks assumed a crimson dye as she endeavoured faintly to smile at the impotent malice of the signora show have i incurred this not surely by my conduct of yesterday but the malevolent disposition of the tyrant devotee became evident to the haughty girl and she deemed her a being too insignificant to excite a moments pain this cannot last for ever thought she hand when the wretch is weary of confining me she will for variety set me at liberty mean time i must amuse myself the best i can she then searched her trunk which on the night of her arrival had been brought into this chamber here she found some drawing materials the surrounding scenery beautifully romantic furnished ample employment for her pencil and with mixed sensations contending in her bosom she seated herself by an open window and endeavoured by occupation to banish reflection this unworthy procedure and system of torment on the part of the signora </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> signora continued in full force for some days till want of exercise and inferior food began though the proud victoria disdained complaint to have a visible effect upon her health at this the signora who was informed of the circumstance by the young girl who attended her began to be slightly alarmed and to apprehend likewise that she might overstep by such measures the limits that had been prescribed her and render herself amenable for any ill consequences that might arise such for example as the sickness of victoria which by distressing and aggrieving laurina might bring her into disfavour with the count perhaps as he appeared so tenderly to love laurina even excite his anger against her for such unauthorised severity for though ardolph had said she might if necessary confine victoria to her chamber he had not bid her do so without cause much less deprive her of her accustomed food and give her only a scanty portion even of the worst under these considerations therefore she determined to relax a little and victoria from being confined the whole of the day and visited only twice in the course of it by catau her attendant with a small quantity of bad bread and milk was suffered accompanied however by catau to walk an hour in the garden morning and evening to attempt to describe the indignant feelings of victoria at this treatment or the struggle it cost her amounting almost to phrensy to subdue the expression of the violent rage that fermented in her bosom would be indeed vain yet she bore all and was determined sooner to die than betray the smallest symptom of vexation or impatience but desire of revenge deep and implacable was nurtured in her hearts core and gave to her character an additional shade of harshness and ferocity thus she became like the untameable hyena that confinement renders only more fierce a few days after this comparative liberty had been allowed her the signora by catau requested her presence in the drawingroom in strict pursuance of the conduct she had prescribed herself she instantly obeyed and regretted only that her pallid cheek and sunken eyes were evidences of suffering beyond her power to conceal and would gratify as she feared the malignity of her tyrant she entered the apartment however with an air neither of sullen reserve nor acknowledged resentment but placid cool and unembarrassed thus too did she learn the most refined artifice which by practice became imbued into the mass of her other evil qualities the signora somewhat discomforted by the unexpected demeanor of victoria having previously arranged her hard features for the intended expression of severe reprimand knew not for the moment how to receive her at length she saidbe seated child with secret scorn and hate victoria obeyed nit is not my intention solemnly and in a laboured accent began the signora sto revert at present to your violent and improper conduct when first you became an inmate under this roof nor upon account of what is past to punish you further i merely wished to evince to you that softness humility and obedience are indispensable requisites here and that nothing can be tolerated that shews an overhearing haughty or ferocious spirit you are by this time i trust properly convinced of your error the heart of victoria rose in her bosomit swelled with indignation to replybut again she conquered her emotions and the only evidence of them was a momentary rush of the blood into her cheeks the signora proceeded under this impression i deem it no longer necessary to confine you you will not however be suffered to go beyond the walls of this mansion the garden at all events must be the extent of your wanderings and your only society catau and at mealtimes myself how the pride of victoria battled for ventsociety for cataubut still she spoke not i shall likewise expect that you peruse such religious book as i shall put into your hands and which i humbly hope will tend to amend the stubbornness of your proud heart moreover that you abjure the vanities of dress and meekly comply with every requisition that as a good and pious catholic anxious for the salvation of your soul i shall think it my duty to make of you the signora new paused for breath victoria still remained silent as not seeming to suppose an answer was required the signora then resumedhow much ought you to thank heaven proud child that has caused you to be placed under my carethat has rescued you from the abode of vice and abomination and placed you beneath the roof of purity and virtue count ardolph even tells me unhappy girl that young as you are you have already suffered your corrupt imagination to wander after man oh santa maria that ever i should live to speak the word continued the devotee turning up her eyes and making the sign of the crossteach me to bear with patience admitting to my presence one of passions and propensities so vile and whose mother has already trespassed before her beyond redemption in the paths of sinyou may retire child she said changing her tone of rhapsody into one of haughty severity retire and seek catau she is a meet companion for the contaminated offspring of one who is immersed many fathoms deep in guilt and shame this last bitter illiberal and uncalled for reproach tingled with burning heat through every vein of the insulted victoria soh mothercruel mother she faintly murmured and hastened from the room it would be endless to dwell on the varied and unworthy artifices which the pious signora di modena had recourse to for the torment and annoyance of her unhappy charge suffice it to say that in time their effect became blunted and despised and the whole thoughts of victoria </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> victoria turned to the possibility of escaping from such vulgar tyranny for long she revolved in her mind even the remotest probability but in vain she could never penetrate farther than the allotted garden and knew not even the precise path or door that might lead beyond iteven were that difficulty obviated she was ignorant of the means of getting to venice whither could she but once escape she was determined to hasten under these circumstances the image of catau presented itself to her mind confined as she was almost wholly to the society of this untaught girl she had leisure to remark in her certain traits of docility and good nature ill concealed beneath the sullen sternness she had evidently been commanded to assume catau was a peasant of switzerland short and thick in her person hard favoured of rude and vacant features ignorant and inured to labour she had been selected by the signora to attend and watch victoria first to mortify her by the careless clumsiness of her manner and the inferiority of her station and secondly from an idea that victoria should despise her too much to endeavour to corrupt or make a friend of her should she even make the attempt the signora presumed the extreme stupidity of catau would render if abortive but here for once the infallible signora as she believed herself was mistaken in her fancied penetration catau was not only not so stupid as she was supposed but was possessed of a certain shrewdness and power of combining ideas which hid beneath an habitual silence and placidity of disposition had drawn upon her the mistaken imputation of heaviness and insensibility catau could think and what was more she could feelyes infinitely beyond those who so proudly sat in judgment upon her character to return however to victoria no sooner had the remotest glimmerings of a possible attempt beamed upon her mind than instantly she determined by every means in her power to attach catau to her interests time and experience had already made her so far acquainted with the malevolent and tormenting spirit of the signora tho modena that she well knew one great step towards the scheme in embryo was not by any means to appear reconciled to the society of catau but on the contrary so seem to shun and despise her for it was sufficient for this worthy catholic to aware of the particular circumstance that could yield a moments satisfaction to say one instantly to reverse it and continue with unwearied perseverance in the line of conduct which appeared to give most pain and uneasiness therefore when she seemed to dislike being accompanied by catau into the garden which she often did purposely the signora with a distorted smile of fancied triumph would tell catau to take her arm and lead her thither thinking by that to inflict on the proud heart of her charge the deepest mortification but here again the signora was fallible for no sooner was victoria out of her sight than she smiled on catau with an air that saidthere is no other way of preserving your attendance this smile would penetrate the heart of her humble companion and she would feel so gratified and affected that perhaps at those moments victoria might have made an attempt not destitute of success such however was not her plan she had not yet sufficiently arranged it and she resolved to do nothing from crude undigested ideas she was but now in the infancy of her attempt founding the disposition of catau and her mailed heart was not to be thrown off its guard by any effusions of softness or feeling attributable to the effect of the moment alone it so happened that one evening they perambulated to a part of the garden which was yet unknown to victoria it was a beautiful close avenue the sides and roof of which were interwoven branches of vine and honeysuckle the entrance was almost concealed by a thick shrubbery which it required no slight ingenuity to penetrate and from the serpentine direction of the path it appeared wholly impossible to ascertain its extent still having made their way through they proceeded victoria with a vague and indefinable feeling of hope and fear and catau merely with that vacant curiosity incident to vulgar minds at length after waling for near half an hour they only reached the extent of the garden bounded by the high circular wall which had so often since the comparative liberty she had enjoyed filled the mind of victoria in contemplating it with a despondency almost hopeless the winding path they had traversed had alone deceived her as to the imagined distance and as she gloomily surveyed the strong and lofty enclosure she almost doubted if any outlet whatever existed surely thought she there is only an entrance to this garden from the house and no outlet from the garden itself while thus she ruminated walking slowly along by the side of the wall she became convinced as she proceeded that the precise part of the garden in which she now found herself she had never seen before at length a small wooden door formed in the wall and secured by two rusty bolts and a heavy iron lock presented itself to her eager view she instantly called to catau to approach and pointing to the door enquired of her if she knew whither it led catau readily applied an eye to the keyhole nit leads into the wood signora which surrounds this house but unless we were outside i cannot tell the exact spot the first part of her reply fixed the breathless attention of victoria into the wood repeated she mentally and applied her eye likewise to the keyhole hand is there no way catau said she nos opening this door none that i know of </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> of signora replied catau hand even if there was you know signora she added in a hesitating voice you know that i understand you catau answered victoria but you know there could be nothing wrong in rambling now and then about the wood and supposing the signora has forbid it how could it ever become known why that is true replied catau thoughtfully i must own it is a hard thing to be so confined but holy jesu signora we could never open this door soh catau said victoria in a gentle voice nothing is impossible to those who are willing you could easily procure the key under some pretence or another and think then how delightful it would be for us to be quite out of the reach of the horrible signora sho ho cried catau with quickness as if suddenly awaking from a reverie i have a thoughts make any enquiries about the key belonging to this door signora would only make us suspected i now remember that when before you came the signora used to send me to ambrosio the gardener that i have seen hanging up under the little shed where he keeps his tools a large bunch of rusty keys i think signora i could lay my hand blindfold upon the very spot where they hang well cried victoria her natural impatience breaking forth through her assumed gentleness and forbearance well hasten then fetch them and let us try them all immediately no signora answered catau with genuine mildness that will not do the evening is drawing inthe signora was already began to miss usby this hour ambrosio too has most likely returned home and may be in the very place i speak of tomorrow when he shall be in a distant part of the garden i will watch the moment when no one is near and slip through his little cottage to the spot for i must pass through ambrosios residence signora to get at iti shall then whip down the keys as quick as lightning and if you will promise signora if you will promise not to betray me nor to stay out too long i will do all i can to oblige youi do not think she continued this door has been opened for a long timeperhaps the very key that belongs to it may be in this bunch victoria was fearful to appear too eager and ardently as she longed to penetrate beyond the unvaried precincts prescribed by the signora she acquiesced with apparent readiness to the arrangements of catau and reluctantly agreed to bend her steps homeward the whole of the night was past in giving way alternately to trembling hope and the deepest despair the perpetual ferment of her brain and above all the violent restraint she imposed upon her feelings and natural disposition scarcely ever suffering herself to be provoked for an instant from the cool and systematic conduct she prescribed herself had began long since to have a visible effect upon her personal appearance she had become thin and pallid but still her eyes burnt with an ardent though melancholy lustre that bespoke the trammelled unsubdued ferocity of her soul about noon the following day catau who had been absent since she had risen for she occupied the same apartment as victoria rushed suddenly into the room and first carefully securing the door drew from her pocket a huge bunch of rusty keys at this sight victorias eyes sparkled and the orient tint revisited momentarily her pallid cheek she devoured them with eager look and in fancy applied them in turn to the lock of the door it was however as yet too early to venture forth for they might be tempted to remain longer absent than would be prudent and suspicion might be excited they therefore agreed to defer till evening their destined trial now in all this active conduct of the simple catau there was absolutely not the smallest intention of aiding or abetting victoria to escape she would on the contrary have shuddered at the idea but though in obedience to the orders of the signora she had in the commencement treated her with sullen coldness yet in a little time as is natural for a young uncorrupted mind she had become weary of this assumed character and returned to the kind gentle and respectful conduct more consonant to her feelings besides which the involuntary awe with which superior rank inspired her was not to be done away for superior rank if accompanied with any dignity makes resistless impression on the vulgar mind victoria who beheld with pleasure this gradual change of conduct divested herself as much as possible of her natural hauteur and having a point to carry she behaved towards catau with the utmost condescension now and then bestowing on her such trifles as were still within her power for of the greatest part of her little possessions clothes c the signora had deprived her under the pretence of curing her of a sinful vanity detrimental to the good of her soul but what victoria could she did and the trifles which with grace she pressed upon catau were acceptable and had their desired effect for vulgar minds are almost always mercenary therefore as far as she could in return she enlarged the slender sphere of victorias comforts and her solitary unvaried amusements thus in procuring for her the keys she had it merely in contemplation to obtain for her if possible a few moments of satisfaction early in the evening they descended to the garden and hastened to the avenue already described strong anxiety winged the feet of victoria and soon she reached the door which had already excited in her mind ideas so various and confused snatching the keys from catau who had toiled after her she applied them in turn with trembling </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> trembling impatience to the lock one at length appeared to suit the best she essayed to turn it but in vainit was reserved for the sinewy hand of catau to triumph over the united strength of rust and iron she wrenched the key with violence it turned in the lock she applied her force to the bolts alternately with her hand and a stone which she had picked up the door at length yielded to her perseverance and flew open happy and joyous sight for the imprisoned victoriashe darted like a wild bird newly escaped from its wiry tenement into the beautiful and romantic wood that presented itself to her ravished view the cautious and less ardent catau closed the door after them and followed victoria looked wistfully around she beheld no boundaries nothing to retard her should she effect her escape for a moment she ruminated then calling catau towards her she said in a careless tonecatau canst thou tell now in which direction lies the city of venice venice signora answered catau pausing and gazing around venice lies there pointing with her finger then said victoria clapping her hands while her cheeks crimsoned with rage monte bello pointing contemptuously towards the left must be on that side reflections too bitter and too strong to be endured rushed through her mind she turned abruptly away and with a look that seemed to sayaccursed be the quarter where i was deceived and duped and accursed every breeze that is wasted thence but far far different sensations actuated her when she cast her eyes forwards there thought she his venice itself and there dwells berenza distance which like death always magnifies to the imagination the charms of those who were beloved together with the deception that had been used to separate her from him induced her to think of him with a tenderness that but for those circumstances perhaps she had never felt in so powerful a degreeah dear berenza she mentally continued might i but hope to see thee once more she turned towards catau anxious to rally her thoughts and taking her arm she walked on with her in silence a thousand unconnected ideas still floated in her mind time passed unheeded till catau respectfully reminding her that it would be expedient to return roused her from her visions of the future and she readily acquiesced in the propriety of the movement it may be naturally presumed that the mind of victoria remained bent upon escape not a day past that she did not induce catau to extend their walks farther and farther from the outlet an outlet the signora little thought they would ever discover much less dream of attempting every day too did she contrive to make silent though accurate observations as to the direct course it would be most proper for her to pursue at length unable to bear continued procrastination she determined to put in execution the plan that had been so long arranging in her brain accordingly on the following evening when the unsuspicious catau had been lured by her kind and condescending manner to accompany her far infinitely farther than they had ever yet ventured she suddenly stopt short and thus addressed the astonished girl catau i will never more return to il boscomy term of slavery is now overi shall bend my course whither i pleaseth the east the west the north or the south listen therefore to what i have to propose exchange instantly your apparel for mine and by your prompt acquiescence merit this diamond ring which has been concealed from the old signora and which i will in that case immediately bestow upon you you can easily as we have hitherto done return into the house unperceived and array yourself in some of your usual attire should you be questioned as to my escape swear what will be true that you was not privy to it should you be questioned as to whither i am gone swear what is true that you cannot tell if even after all this the signora should think fit to discharge you i do not see that you will have any thing to regret and with regard to any advantage you might think you lost this ring which is extremely valuable will more than indemnify you now these are the pacific terms which i propose to you if you refuse them i am equally determined to fly and if nothing but violence will avail to oppose my strength to yours my strength it is true may not equal yours but you may find to your cost catau she added with meaning in her eyes that victory may not always depend upon that alone catau trembled like a leaf in the gale the firmness and decision with which she had been addressed left her not the power of reply victoria marking her consternation began calmly to take off her robe and in that gentle tone she knew so well how to assume thus went oni see catau that you have the good sense to feel the propriety of my resolution and the kindness to wish to assist me in it come my good girl prepare to undress soh signora faltered out catgut length involuntarily taking at the same time the first step to divest herself of her attireoh signora what are you about to do sto leave a tyrant answered victoria with quickness her eyes darting fire hand i wish you catau speedily the same good fortunecome hasten your movements she proceeded handing her the robe she had now taken off poor catau mechanically proceeded todo as she was ordered hurried in her naturally slow conceptions yet in the native goodness and simplicity of her heart seeing something in the conduct of victoria which she could not blame for who more than the poor drudge catau had reason </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> reason to hate the tyrannical and never satisfied signora she went oh but not so quickly as victoria desired to exchange with her gradually every necessary external part of her dress to render the disguise complete though the imperious unaltered victoria had acquired by assumed gentleness the love of the humble catau yet had she still the power of inspiring her with awe conscious of that and knowing that her weak mind must in the present case be taken by surprise and subdued by the force of language she had preferred this mode to that of attempting sudden flight such an act would have roused her drowsy faculties and once impelled it was possible she might have excelled her in swiftness of foot which would have delayed perhaps destroyed her entire project besides it was infinitely more politic to make catau a friend than by apparent ingratitude and want of confidence render her perhaps an enemy the transformation was at length completed when victoria presenting catau with the promised ring slightly pressed her hand and saidmy good my honest catau if you possibly can return to the house unseen and enter the chamber we have usually occupiedsecure the door should the signora see nothing of us for the night she will conclude that supperless we have retired to bed and will not have the foolish good nature to disturb us perfectly satisfied to have saved a meal we are never in the habits of seeing her till late in the day i shall then be safe from the reach of tyranny at least i hope so and should we ever meet again you will have no cause to repent the part you have actedadieu my kind girl for time fliesadieu return homewards and do not attempt to follow me soh signora signora sobbed catau while the tears streamed copiously over cheeks resembling the fullblown damask rose if you really love me catau said the calm victoria who felt not a shadow of regret at leaving her faithful companion if you really love me detain me no longer but turn at once and let me behold you on your return catau with a violent burst of tears and sobs seized the hand of victoria and impressed on it a kiss forcible in proportion to the affection it was meant to convey she then turned hastily away and without power to speak a word proceeded towards the house with a speed almost sufficient to satisfy the impatience of victoria she remained however upon the spot thinking every moment an age till the poor girl was out of sight who unconsciously however turned frequently round to obtain a last look of her she so much regretted to leave at these periods victoria though with a feeling of vexation and anger would hastily wave her hand as if to sayi see thee but prythee goon at length some trees intervening excluded entirely from her view the object she desired to lose sight of then hastily turning from the spot she bent her steps forward fondly congratulating herself that every step she took brought her nearer and nearer to venice the sun had set about an hour victoria who had walked or rather ran with the utmost celerity from the moment that she beheld catau no longer had hoped in a short time to have penetrated the wood she however found herself mistaken for the wood was of extensive dimensions and ignorant of its windings she had not taken the shortest way to emerge from it though she continued her speed with unabated eagerness night to her confusion began to draw in and still she was wandering in its mazes as it grew darker the necessity of abstaining from her journey became evident hand whither can i seek for shelter to night she mentally ejaculated casting her eyes around a small white shed embosomed at a distance among some trees caught her view she felt an emotion of gladness and was hastening towards it but suddenly recollecting that when her flight should be discovered it was not improbable but the very road she had taken might be searched and that in such case this shed being liable to the observations of others as well as herself might undergo some scrutiny she determined instantly to avoid as much as possible the habitations of man and to pursue the path that appeared the most unfrequented sooner than incur the smallest risk of being traced the firmminded victoria decided on passing the night in common with the race of animal nature beneath no other canopy than the starsprinkled heavens in pursuance of this resolve she turned from the path that led as she now perceived to various scattered seclusion of humble life and beneath the umbrageous shade of a selfformed bower composed of jessamine and the luxurious vine overhanging and intertwining from a wild hedge on one side of the forest she cast herself for repose there thought she why may i not enjoy a few hours of more refreshing rest than hitherto i have obtained on more luxuriant beds i am safe too in doing so for the signora will not even hear of my escape till noon tomorrow thus reflecting sleep stole gradually over her senses fatigued by the unusual exertions of the day for some hours she enjoyed undisturbed repose nor till the sunbeams playing through the tender branches upon her closed eyelids and the carol of the birds exhilarated by the divine rays of the morning burst melodiously forth did she awaken she no sooner opened her eyes than starting upon her feet she again commenced her journey with the utmost speed a few naples biscuits which she had the day before thought of securing served her for breakfast and she ate them as she proceeded her chief desire was now to leave behind her the wood </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> wood for this she increased her speed and after two hours walking found herself in a kind of path that she hoped would give her some unerring clue to proceed by eager with this idea she swiftly measured its winding way it terminated at length in a lonely canal bordered on each side by poplars and acacias and victoria beholding this cast herself almost hopeless close to its edge soh she cried show deeply must i have wanderedon this melancholy canal no gondola most likely ever passes to retrace my steps would be certain destruction to my hopeshere then may i as well remain and die she had thrown herself upon her face and despondently leaned her forehead upon her clasped hands the soft gale sighed among the treesno human being seemed nigh to interrupt the solitude the melody of the birds among the lofty poplars and the spreading acacias alone broke the heavenly silence of the scene and victoria indifferent to these wild beauties so hostile to her wishes remained prostrate and in despair at length a low distant sound struck upon her ear she starteddid it not resemble the remote noise of oars dipping at measured intervals in the canal no no it was but the breeze agitating the leaves of the trees and again she reclined her head presently the sound returned but with increased effect it was accompanied most joyous convictionby a rough voice singing a song common among the gondoliers in an instant victoria was upon her feet she bent eagerly over the canal and descried a gondola most leisurely approaching and containing only a single rower who was coasting coolly along the edge of the lake soh thought victoria non that careless being depends my fatehow slowly he approaches while i burn with impatience without increasing an iota in speed by degrees the gondola came near victoria eagerly hailed it whither go you friend she asked sto venice victorias heart leaped wilt thou permit me she asked sto enter thy gondola canst thou pay my pretty one asked the gondolier in turn victoria was silent all she had possessed her ring she had given to catau the gondolier was silent likewise and her hopes began again to fade at length she cast her eyes upon the countenance of the gondolier though coarse and brawny she perceived that he was a young man alas she said i have no money friend but i have a lover in venice and if thou wilt convey me thither the blessed virgin will ever send thee luck the gondolier in turn cast his eyes upon victoria he beheld beneath her peasants hat that she was beautiful he conceived her from her garb to be a peasant in reality and readily believed that she had no money the gondolier himself had a mistress that he loved but on account of his poverty her parents refused the match and he saw herby stealth alone he conceived a fellowfeeling then for victoria and towing his gondola close to the edge of the lake he stretched forth his hand to her which she joyfully seized and vaulted into the gondola who can describe the sensations of victoria she could not speak thousand gay anticipations revelled in her mind and their enjoyment was too sweet to be unnecessarily interrupted the gondolier however thinking he had at least a right to her conversation for his kindness did not long permit her to indulge but how my pretty one he began could ever you think of meeting a gondola where i found you perched it is not once in a century that any of us pass thereabouts except indeed at an odd time or so why if it had not been a cavalier that i took up this blessed morning before the heats began to carry him to a pretty villa that he has close almost to the borders of the canaland between you and i i carried a pretty signora along with himhis reason no doubt for setting off at such an hour so private you know well if it had not been for that i say which is no business either of mine or yours i was well enough paidthe devil a gondola you might have caught that way these six days so you see my pretty rogue how lucky you ireland to get such luck for nothing too victoria who had long ceased to attend to the longwinded dissertation of the gondolier catching only his last words most cordially assented to them at the same time expressing her gratitude for his goodnature to this the gondolier made no other reply than a broad significant grin winking at the same time one eye alluding as victoria supposed to the lover she had told him of and then began again with the song he had been singing before she hailed him soon to her infinite joy victoria beheld the towers and domes of stately venice rising proudly from the adriatic encircled round by its green arms it was the time of the carnival multitudes of gay and splendid gondolas appeared upon the lake as they drew near they were now upon the point of landing at st marks victoria turned to thank the gondolier for his kindnesses nodded and smiled and helped her out of the gondola whispering in her ear that he should never at any time object to do so pretty a girl a service once more at liberty and at her own disposal secure too in her disguise victoria without trepidation mixed with the gay crowd of st marks place in the saint hope perhaps of discovering among them one to whom her heart involuntarily pointed fatigued at length by exertion and want of food for she had tasted nothing but a few biscuits since the preceding evening and evening again was now far advanced </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> advanced she quitted st marks place to seek a spot less thronged and confused as she proceeded a sudden faintness the consequence of exhaustion overcame her so far that to prevent falling in the street she hastened beneath a lofty portico and seated herself upon one of its steps leaning her swimming head upon her hand she remained for some moments unable to move her heart palpitated and she began to fear that mind might not always prove omnipotent over matter by degrees however the faintness went off she raised her head the gay appearance of the streets and the canals every window illuminated and the splendid apparel of the masks ill and overpowered as she felt yielded her a sensation of the highest delight she could remember only that she had escaped from a dreary solitude and the most abominable tyranny and every feeling of sickness vanished at the idea as still she continued sitting her symmetrical figure habited in her homely garb and those strong marked features shaded by a large and simple hat amid the gay and hurrying crowd that still continued to pass a group of masqueraders caught her attention among them was one of a tall and noble figure far surmounting the rest he wore a domino of blue silk wrapped carelessly round him so that his left shoulder with part of his vest was displayed which sparkled with jewels on his head he wore a spanish hat of black velvet surmounted by a lofty plume of snowwhite feathers confined in it by a diamond loop upon this attractive figure her eyes fixed as he past with a sort of confused recollection of having before seen it the hasty glimpse she had caught however was insufficient to ascertain where and involuntarily she started up to have a better view of his person as she did so he turned round true he was masked but conviction flashed upon her senses sudden and irresistible was the impulse she flew towards him and laying her hand upon his arm exclaimed berenza yesoh yes in a low but eager voice answered the mask pressing her hand upon his arm mark me but retire victoria drew backthe mask rejoined the group he had a moment separated from and was soon lost in the crowd bitter was the vexation and disappointment of victoriaby happy accident was thus discovered and in the same moment lost him on whom her chief hopes depended but still the splendid illusion of the scene remainedthe mind of victoria was supremely elastic and she consoled herself with the reflection that she was still in venice and at liberty she continued mechanically moving along till at length she found herself in a more retired part of the city where resided some of the inferior inhabitants from this place she hastened but every where the brilliancy of the scene began now to fade the night was considerably advanced the gay crowd visibly diminishing had entered their houses to carouse and the splendid light decreasing assumed the appearance of a twilight gilded by the last rays of the setting sun the adventurous victoria now began to perceive the possibility there existed of passing another night without shelter the reflection was unwelcome to her feelings but she preferred it to the remotest risk of discovery by seeking out any of her former acquaintances or dependants again therefore seating herself beneath a portico she leaned lier head upon her hand and gave way to reflections of a gloomy tendency she was hungry and fatigued and these circumstances added to the depression of her spirits suddenly a voice sounded in her earfollow me she raised her head but perceived no one again therefore she covered her eyes with her hand and endeavoured to resume her train of thought rise said the same voice again she started and instinctively arose the portico at which she had seated herself was the first in the street a tall figure darted as it were from behind her it appeared enveloped in a dark cloak and retreating swiftly to such a distance as to render its actual presence dubious beckoned in an inclining attitude to victoria glad even of so mysterious perhaps dangerous a mandate she hastened to obey as fast as her enfeebled limbs would allow the stranger perceiving that she did so again retreated but still continuing to invite victoria still pursued at length in a deserted part he stopped victoria approached he encircled her waist and drawing aside his cloak she discovered the spangled habit and the figure of berenza hush he hastily exclaimed perceiving she was about to express her joy then again withdrawing himself he proceeded towards a small door in the street at which he gave three distinct knocks it opened cautiously he put forth his hand and beckoned victoria she drew near he seized her arm and conducting her into the house the door closed they had not walked many paces through a dark narrow entry before berenza stopped and taking a handkerchief from his pocket bound it lightly over the eyes of victoria saying to her in a low voice fear not this shall not be for long victoria only smiled and did not answer at length they ascended some stairs and appeared to enter an apartment the conte pressed the hand of victoria and bade her take the bandage from her eyes she did so and instantly uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise fora sumptuous and brilliantly illuminated chamber struck upon her dazzled sight the walls were covered with large resplendent mirrors that variously reflected her simply attired but graceful figure berenza appeared for a moment to enjoy her surprise then fervently pressing her in his arms he said there my lovely and beloved victoria will be sole mistress she will no more fly from the man who more than life </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> life adores her fly repeated victorian never fled from thee berenza didst thou not my love much then requires explanation but not at this juncture you look pallid and fatigued rest here awhile till some slight refreshment is procured so saying he gently seated victoria upon a superb sopha and for a few moments left her to herself the most pleasing ideas now took possession of her mind as in a recumbent posture she awaited the return of berenza her fatigues her difficulties even her imprisonment all was forgotten in her present prospect of long desired happiness know then cruel and ungenerous mother she exclaimed thou canst no longer deprive me of a happiness similar to that which thou so selfishly enjoyed a happiness which but for thee my awakened fancy had never conceived nor my soul coveted ah mother mother thou didst deceive and betray me but i shall still live to thank thee for teaching me the path to love and joy as she concluded this wild expression of her misguided sentiments berenza entered he had heard what she had uttered and pleased as he undoubtedly was that chance had thrown in his way the girl he had admired and loved yet his delicate and refined mind experienced a sensation of regret at the avowed freedom of her principles yet still more severe were his reflections against the authors of this mischief the parent whose example and conduct had corrupted the sentiments of her daughter and the wretch whose seductions had corrupted the parent but mentally he promised himself to restrain and correct the improper bias of victorias character for berenza though a refined voluptuary possessed a noble virtuous and philosophic soul he seated himself by the side of victoria and gently took her hand it was dry and feverish you have undergone considerable exertion this day he said gazing on her countenance have you not my sweet victoria victoria smiled and great was the dismay of berenza when he learned that for upwards of twentyfour hours she had not tasted food he instantly forbade her to utter another word till nature was recruited and the moment a collation he had ordered made its appearance he tenderly pressed her to eat nor till he thought her sufficiently refreshed would he reply to the most pressing of her eager interrogatories respecting the real cause of his precipitate departure from monte bello at length when he explained to her this circumstance and his conviction at the time of having acted expressly consonant to her own wishes nothing could exceed the rage she evinced at the deception which had been practiced and unwilling as was berenza to countenance or encourage the undue violence of her disposition he could scarcely avoid participating the expression of her sentiments the gross unworthiness of the parental duplicity had surprised and disgusted him and if for a moment before he had been disposed to lament the effect of her daughters slight upon the mind of laurina he now felt that compassionate sentiment give way to one of pleasure that victoria had escaped and escaped to him it appeared too in the course of his explanation to victoria that surprised at not receiving form her the smallest intelligence for a length of time though according to the intimation in the note he was taught to expect he might shortly hear from her he had impatient at the delay presented himself recalled at monte bello there had be learned that by her own desire his fair mistress had taken her departure there from thence and had expressly required that he should be kept in ignorance of her retreat for that reflection having convinced her of the impropriety of encouraging his attentions she had determined to endeavour at least to overcome it and therefore conceived that absence was the most likely nay the only mode of forwarding so desirable a point i confess pursued conte berenza from the knowledge i possessed of your character i thought such sudden variation of sentiment almost incompatible with it but having no alternative for i felt i had no right to request an explanation from your mother or the count you according to the law of things appertaining rather to them than me and urged by the cool looks i received i took my departure secretly hoping that time would bring me some satisfactory elucidation of a circumstance that i could not help considering as somewhat mysterious ere their mutual explanations had ceased the night was far advanced the history of victorias sufferings at the signora de modenas the mode of her escape her difficulties her precautions to avoid being tracedall all must be detailed and expatiated on ere she would think of retiring berenza at length ventured to recur to the necessity there was for her taking some rest unwillingly at his delicate solicitation she agreed to do so when summoning some female attendants he ordered them to shew her to the chamber which had been hastily prepared for her no sooner had victoria reached her apartment than she requested her attendants to withdraw for she was desirous of indulging alone the influx of her ideas delight and pleasure had such complete possession of her that scarce could her trembling hands perform the office of disrobing herself long too after she had entered her elegant bed which rose in the form of a dome bordered with deep gold fringe did her buoyant spirits drive sleep from her pillow at length however her ardent imagination became overpowered she fell asleep and brilliant fantasies gamboled before her in the dreams of the night berenza too retired to repose but his reasoning mind though in such recent attainment of a desired good was placid and unruffled the images which occupied it were devoid of the romantic trappings of fancy he beheld victoria such as she really was unembellished </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> unembellished unornamented his keen eye that perceived her beauties discerned likewise her defects he appreciated her character he beheld at once her pride her stubbornness her violence her fiert can i asked himself be rationally happy with a being imperfect as she now is no unless i can modify the strong features of her character into the nobler virtues i feel that all her other attractions will be insufficient to fill up my craving heart pursuing these reflections berenza sell asleep victoria beneath his roof voluntarily in his power he had leisure to revise and amplify on those errors which while she seemed unattainable struck him in a point of view infinitely less momentous such is the nature of man the sun had risen far above the horizon when victoria awakened she hastily arose and perceived that the peasants garb had been exchanged for habiliments more resembling those she had till now been accustomed to wear this she with justice attributed to the delicate attention of berenza dressing herself she summoned attendance and was informed that il conte berenza had been long waiting breakfast for her and desired them to conduct her to the apartment where he was she found him sitting upon a sopha with breakfast things before him on her entrance he rose and conducted her to sit beside him his demeanor towards her was rather that of a sincere and a tender friend than of an ardent lover for the mind of berenza ever aiming at perfection felt that ere he could avow himself the latter he must himself new model the object during breakfast he conversed upon indifferent subjects but more sedulously and more anxious than ever did he scrutinise her as though in her air and in her eyes he would read every movement of her soul yet true it was that berenza was a voluptuary but a philosophical delicate and refined voluptuaryit was not the perfection of body only that he required but the perfection also of mind victoria perceived that embarrassment clouded the manners of the conte she sought by every means to draw him from his apparent abstraction and gaily taking his hand she said berenza why are you not chearful you were wont to tell me that i should constitute your happiness if once i became yoursnow then that fortune has united us you appear less happy than when you despaired of gaining me nay indeed dear berenza almost indifferent to her you so professed to love berenza rose during the speech of victoria a new idea had taken possession of his mindit was the tormenting the useless reflection that perhaps he was not particularly distinguished by the confidence of victoria that perhaps she had flown to him merely as a refuge from discomfort and oppression and that had another addressed her she would equally have shown to him this suggestion struck a pang to the heart of the refining philosopher suppressing his emotion however and taking the hand of victoria he only said you have often my love known me abstracted and thoughtful without any particular reason occurring at the moment heed me not and i shall speedily be myself again then i will withdraw to my chamber my lord said victoria secretly piqued and disgusted that her presence should not be a talisman against every species of uneasiness do so my love consider yourself here as mistress and all i have at your disposal make such arrangements as you may think fit without hesitation employ yourself a few hours apart from mewe will meet at dinner and in the evening repair to the laguna where my victoria will be the fairest victoria withdrew but her air was indignant and berenza observing it sighed as he gazed after her mentally exclaiming victoria how imperfect thou art fool that i was he continued i never possessed either the heart or the mind of this girlcircumstances only have impelled her towards meoh could i but penetrate her thoughts could i but discover her actual feelings my mind would be at rest were i only convinced of her love i could easily new model her character because the precepts and the wishes of those we love sink deep into the heart but no matter i will be the friend the brother the protector of the girl who has thrown herself into my arms i will love her too but never no never will i meanly take advantage of a fortuitous circumstance i will be convinced of her affection her absolute her exclusive affection and till i am thoroughly convinced i will be her friend and not her lover such was the determination of the reasoning philosopher whose delicate and fastidious mind made its own food and took for ever a pleasure in repining upon itself at dinner they again met and when the heat of the day was succeeded by the cooling breezes of evening berenza led his fair charge to st marks place along which multitudes of gay venetians were flocking to get into their gondolas the conte assisted victoria into his which was splendid and gaily accoutred happy was the vain victoria to find herself thus in the midst of the gay world the laguna was covered with an innumerable quantity of gondolas soft music sounded from every side and sweet female voices sometimes accompanied the strains the scene elevated her spirits she blest the moment when she had escaped from the tyranny of a discontented bigot she cast her eyes around and she perceived that she had excited that attention and admiration she so much loved to obtain she even fancied that the venetian belles viewed her with an air of envythe idea was doubly pleasing and her animation increased but she did not for a moment suppose that this envy was excited on account of the companion who sat beside her berenza </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> berenza was indeed accounted the most accomplished cavalier in venice the very phoenix of grace and elegance his opinions his taste his approbation formed the standard of fashionfor though no one knew or appreciated the dignity and delicacy of his mind yet was he considered the most graceful and fascinating of men his society was universally courted even by the women though they well knew his refined and superior judgment his was not the heart of a sensualist if indeed a sensualist hath a heart he could not gaze enraptured on the accurate formation of a limb waste his hours in contemplating incessantly a beautiful form or resign his independence while admiring some harmonious combination of feature or complexion even his most irrational hours were never spent at the feet of a simpering coquet no it was necessary that berenzas beauties should be polished that they should possess the talisman of mind well was this general trait in his character understood yet his society and his notice were eagerly courted by femalessince to attach him would indeed have been triumph who then could forbear the attempt victoria excited therefore universal envy in one sex and she likewise excited universal admiration in the other the notice she attracted filled her vain ambitious heart with exultation and it was with infinite regret she left the gay covered lake to return to the palazzo of her lover flattered by the attention she had excited the philosophic berenza viewed her involuntarily with a feeling of encreased approbation for true it is man is too apt to be guided in his estimate of things by the degree of estimation they may obtain from others and to be influenced in his opinion by the standard often depraved of the public taste supper being prepared for them the conte began wholly to relax from the restraint he had imposed upon his manner he seated himself with a smiling air by the delighted victoria who instantly availed herself of the gaiety and unreserve of his manner to ask an explanation of what had more than once obtruded itself upon her mind looking somewhat archly in his countenance she said tell me berenza if the question be not improper why with so much caution and mystery you first acknowledged your recognition of me and conducted me hither yet now carelessly exhibit yourself with me in public soh woman curious woman said the conte laughingbut i will tell thee victoria frederic alvarez a friend of mine and a spanish nobleman of high rank had a mistress called megalena strozzi by birth a florentine of this mistress he was passionately fond and often pressed me to be introduced to her but having many other engagements i always declined nat length one day he succeeded in securing me and i was reluctantly dragged into the presence of his syren mark the untoward result on the honour of a venetian i solemnly assure you i paid her no extraordinary attention nor any whatever of a nature that could be considered dishonourable towards my friend yet she exerted her utmost artifice she used every blandishment to allure me megalena was beautiful she was beside elegant and accomplished i am not as i think either a philosopher or a stoic but a man refining on my own sensations i yielded i own to the witcheries of megalena and i felt no compunctious visiting from a consciousness of treacherous conduct toward my friends had not attempted to seduce his mistress it was she on the contrary who had so powerfully addressed my feelings and my senses that was in the fullest acceptation of the term the seductress at length however the jealous alvarez discovered the infidelity of her to whom he was devoted heart and soul he sought out foaming with rage and outraged love and gave me my choice to meet him in honourable combat or be passively run through the body breathing death and vengeance it was vain to reason with him i therefore preferred the former offer and we met fury rendered his hand unsteady and when i succeeded in drawing a little blood from his arm some of our mutual friends who were privy to the affair endeavoured to explain to alvarez the folly of fighting for an abandoned wanton he heard them with a gloomy air but appeared convinced by their arguments i offered him my hand but he refused it with rage and soon after left venice since that period i have occasionally visited megalena but never could i prevail upon myself to consider her as a mistress from the very obvious and unerring reflection that a female who could abandon a sincere and doting lover for me would as readily abandon me for any other who might attract her wandering eye still however the jealous the alternate fits of love and resentment which she thought proper to exhibit whenever i presented myself before her have long been a source of extreme unpleasantness to me she has frequently sworn with a frantic air that though she bears with my insulting indifference towards her that should she ever have reason to attribute my coldness to regard for another my death alone would satiate her vengeance thus though i know the irregularity of her life and that her undisciplined passions hurry her into the most abject excesses i do not wish insolent and unjustifiable as such conduct would be to induce her threshed attacks against my life or peace i therefore in my research after you used all possible precaution nor did i though you saw me not even for once lose sight of you my reason for placing a fillet over your eyes was merely to enjoy your astonishment when it should be removed for i introduced you by a private way into my house i believe fair victoria pursued the conte smiling and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> and taking her hand i have now explained all that may have appeared mysterious to you you have my lord answered victoria but you stillstill visit megalena then she pursued while her jealous eyes wandered i have as i said replied the conte smiling been accustomed to visit her andand you still intend my lord berenza my future intentions replied berenza seriously will be considerably influenced by you but my lord said the artful victoria with an air of innocence unwilling to proceed too far you love me too well i hope to think of another while i am with you sweet victoria exclaimed berenza that is spoken like yourself the signora megalena must now be tranquil she must for she will see us together and it will be beyond her power to separate us yesterday i had visited at her house she knew the colour of my habit for the carnival her eyes no doubt followed me every where and had she perceived my attention attracted to you she would either have had you entrapped and conveyed out of my reach or have followed me even into my apartment like a vengeful fury therefore it was i conveyed you into the palazzo by a secret way wholly unknown even to her but let us dismiss this unworthy subject once for all victoria be assured it is not in the power of a megalena to attract me from thee i have known her tis true she has been the companion of my looser hours but she was never the mistress the beloved acknowledged friend of berenza no it is not enough for me that my mistress should be admired by men they must envy me in their hearts the possession of her she whom berenza can love must tower above her sex she must have nothing of the tittering coquet the fastidious prude or the affected idiot she must abound in the graces of mind as well as of body for i prize not the woman who can yield only to my arms a lovely insipid form which the veriest boor in nature can enjoy in as much perfection as myself my mistress too must be mine exclusively heart and soul others may gaze and sigh for her but must not dare approach it is she too who while her beauty attracts must have dignity sufficient to repel them if she forfeit for a moment her selfpossession i cast her for ever from my bosom but if he added with increasing energy nit be within the verge of possibility that she forfeit her honour thenoh then her blood alone can wash out her offence victoria grasping her hand dost thou mark mehast thou courage hast thou firmness to become the friend the mistress of berenza victoria smiled with ineffable dignity she laid her hand upon the arm of berenza and said eyes i have courage to become everything to you why these doubts these stipulations berenza she pursued with a serious air but thou must love me victoria me alone said berenza fixing his eyes upon her countenance hand do i not my lord love you alone she said not certainlynot enough he replied thou art a stranger to the turnings and windings of thine own heart mentally added he then rising hastily he took the hand of victoriaretire he said in a gentle voice retire to repose and tomorrow we shall meet again he led her to the door and saluted her hand how few in character resemble berenzayet in such perfection are some minds regulated ultimately enhancing by their forbearance the pleasures they obtain some time passed on thus and still berenza languishing for positive conviction of victorias love for him continued to treat her as a beloved and innocent sister rather than as a destined mistress for though his taste in female beauty led him to view that of victoria with the eye of an enraptured amateur still was he too scrupulously refined to accept the privilege fortune had thrown in his way or anticipate by premature encroachment the smallest of the pleasures he promised himself for the future when she should prove to him delightful idea that her heart was intrinsically his charmed as he was with the boldness of her natural character charmed as he was with the graces of her face and figure yet was berenza a man of too proud a mind to be swayed to a conduct that his peculiar delicacy contemned in vain would he sometimes seek for a trait of innocent tenderness in the countenance of victoria something that should convince him he was beloved no hers was not the countenance of a madona it was not of angelic mould yet though there was a fierceness in it it was not certainly a repelling but a beautiful fierceness dark noble strongly expressive every lineament bespoke the mind which animated it true no mild no gentle no endearing virtues were depicted there but while you gazed upon her you observed not the want of any charm her smile was fascination itself and in her large dark eyes which sparkled with incomparable radiance you read the traces of a strong and resolute mind capable of attempting any thing undismayed by consequences and well and truly did they speak her figure though above the middle height was symmetry itself she was as the tall and graceful antelope her air was dignified and commanding yet free from stiffness she moved along with head erect and with step firm and majestic nor was her carriage ever degraded by levity or affectation living under his roof almost perpetually in his company she became daily a more dangerous object to the peace and to the forbearance of berenza yet even in those times when his ideas and actions were least subject to the controul of his reason it was but </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> but for an instant to admit the tormenting reflection that perhaps she felt not for him a genuine and ardent affection for a sudden gloom to take possession of him and overspread his countenance the singularity of his conduct surprised victoria she endeavoured to investigate the cause and to trace if possible the workings of his mind to this end she watched with scrutinizing eye every movement every look she listened to and weighed every word he spoke then combining the whole discovered ere long the secret which pressed upon his feelings what then would she exclaim confiding her reflections to her pillow berenza fears that i love him not this idea then is the grand source of his constrained mysterious conduct towards me then reverting to herself she examined the state of her heart respecting him hand do i not then love berenza she saidi know not nor what maybe the precise nature of love but this i know that i prefer him to all men that i think him elegant and accomplished and that if death snatched him from me i should grieve true my sensations towards him have nothing ardent in them nor do i feel that oppression of soul that doubt that uneasiness respecting his attachment for me that he seems to entertain of mine yes i feel it is requisite to my future prospects to those plans and views yet vague and indefinite which are floating in my brain that he should not entertain any not the smallest doubts of my regard for him i must endeavour then to suit my conduct to the fastidious delicacy of his ideas so reasoned from combined inferences the subtle victoria true indeed it was she did not love the scrupulous the refined berenza she was incapable of loving such a man nay she was by nature unfitted to admit so soft so pure a sentiment as real love victorias heart was a stranger to every gentle noble or superior feeling the ambitious the selfish the wild and the turbulent were hers hers were the stormy passions of the soul goading on to ruin and despair berenzas were mild philosophic though proudly tenacious his were as the even stream calm yet deepers as the foaming cataract rushing headlong from the rocky steep and raging in the abyss below she was not susceptible of a single sentiment vibrating from a tender movement of the heart she could not feel gratitude she could not therefore feel affection she could inflict pain without remorse and she could bitterly revenge the slightest attempt to inflict it on herself the wildest passions predominated in her bosom to gratify them she possessed an shrinking relentless soul that would not startle at the darkest crime unhappy girl whom nature organised when offended with mankind and whom education that might have corrected tended only to confirm in depravity berenza as before has been remarked was the only man who had ever paid her particular attention consequently it was natural that what feeling of preference she was capable of entertaining should be given to him she voluntarily sought his protection because she knew not whom else to solicit she remained under his roof for she knew not of another and though any heart but hers would have been deeply and enthusiastically affected by the nobleness and delicacy of conduct he had under all these circumstances observed towards her yet did she remain wholly unimpressed nor was a single idea awakened by it that did not revert to self she saw only that it would be necessary and politic to answer his sincere and honourable love at least with an appearance equally ardent and sincere the peculiar cast of berenzas disposition was in reality melancholy sombre and reflective though in society seeming gay and careless she then must become melancholy retired and abstracted berenza would hence be induced to scrutinize the cause artifice on her side and natural selflove on his would easily make him attribute it to the effects of a violent and concealed love thus would an explanation be the result and the reserve the doubts the hesitations of berenza at an end her plan arranged she entered on it gradually her eyes no longer full of a wild and beautiful animation were taught to languish or to six for hours with musing air upon the ground her gait no longer firm and elevated became hesitating and despondent she no longer engrossed the conversation she became silent apparently absent and plunged in thought it was now berenza who had to call her from a melancholy abstraction to enquire if any hidden uneasiness preyed upon her mind victoria saw exultingly saw the gradual operation of her plan new and rapturous ideas scarcely admitted even to himself began to occupy the soul of berenza but as yet he spoke not he hoped nothe was slow because he was fearful to believe it was one night after a day of wellacted gloom and oppression of spirits that victoria having left the apartment occupied by the conte retired into the saloon and throwing herself upon a sopha near one of the windows enjoyed the delicious fresco of the evening she had not been long in this situation before berenza unable to bear her absence determined to seek her in the saloon and perceiving her reclined upon a sopha imagined she slept closing gently the door therefore he softly approached her in an instant an idea had glanced across the mind of victoria she determined to avail herself of this circumstance and of berenzas mistake shutting her eyes she affected in reality to be asleep the conte drew near and gazing upon her for a few moments he seated himself beside her soh victoria in a low voice he tenderly said why why my love art thou unhappy oh that that i might only hope </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> hope i were the envied causeah were it indeed so berenza would be too happy he paused victoria as if disturbed in her sleep heaved a broken sigh faintly giving utterance to the name of berenza berenza scarcely ventured to breathe why wilt thou not love me berenza she murmured berenzas heart beat high he drew his breath quick victoria was sensible of his emotion none word more thought she indeedindeed berenzai love thee she articulated starting up and stretching out her arms as if under the impression of her dream attempting to embrace him when opening her eyes and affecting surprise and shame at the sight of berenza she covered her face with her hands and turned aside the violent emotion of berenza was such that for some moments he was deprived of the power of speech the blood rushed from his heart to his head his senses became confused when seizing wildly in his arms the artful victoria he exclaimed in hurried accentsthou art mineyes i now know that thou art mine proud of her achievement it was victorias care that her lover should not recover from his delusion well did she support the character she had assumed and the tender refined berenza became convinced that he possessed the first pure and genuine affections of an innocent and lovely girl berenza became daily more attached to victoria his scrupulous doubts his reserves wholly vanished and fondly he flattered himself that he was as much the possessor of her dearest affections as she was the mistress over his still though his love for her was carried in some respects to a romantic height his pride forbade him to marry her there was a certain stigma in his idea attached to her through the misconduct of her mother which it was impossible for his delicate mind to overlook of this sentiment however the haughty victoria was unconscious and she simply imagined that her present union with the conte was chosen by him expressly for the purpose of convincing her that his devotion towards her needed not the aid of artificial ties to rivet it under this impression her vain spirit was flattered and little did she ever suppose that while the proud venetian deemed her worthy of becoming his mistress he conceived her unfit for the high distinction of becoming his wife it was one beautiful evening that accompanied by the admired victoria berenza in his splendid gondola mixed with the gay concourse upon the laguna every one appeared exhilarated and victoria gazing around felt in the moment that she excited the admiration so dear to her soul that she required nothing more in the power of man to bestow while her eyes still wandered exacting attention from all a gondola passed close by that of berenzas it contained only one female besides the gondoliers who in the moment of rapidly passing fixed her eyes upon victoria with a rage and malignity so exquisitely bitter that it was impossible momentary as was the glance that its expression could be mistaken for an instant victoria was awakened from her dream of vanity she looked at berenza but perceiving from the unaltered expression of his countenance that he had not observed the circumstance she thought it too insignificant to advert to and other objects soon made her forget it altogether at length they returned home and the evening was concluded with a convivial party and a dance to which many were invited that had not been present during the early part of the evening at a late hour the company separated and victoria and the conte retired to repose victoria however felt no inclination to sleep the festive scenes of the evening passed in mirthful review before her the music still founded in her ears and the dancers still figured in her sight she skimmed over in her mind the adulation the elegant and wellturned compliments she had received and in idea again she enjoyed and smiled at them then she reverted to her evenings amusement on the laguna and on reverting to that she suddenly remembered the look she had received from the female who had passed so swiftly by she was on the point of mentioning to the conte this circumstance but perceiving that overcome by wine and the fatigue of the evening he slept she would not awaken him and pursued the diversified current of her ideas still however she could not lose the remembrance of this malignant glance and was embarrassing herself in vain conjectures as to the cause which should induce any one to view her with particular rancour when a gentle rustling at the further end of the chamber caught her attention this interrupted her thoughts and called them to external objects the bed on which she lay was surmounted by a superb canopy the curtains were drawn on each side but remained opened at the foot the rustling increased she fixed her eyes on the opposite side of the room where a large window jutted out and opened into a balcony on the outside the window itself was concealed by a thick curtain by degrees this curtain was moved a little on one side half the figure of a man became visible and presently the whole the chamber was faintly enlightened by a lamp and she observed as softly though with long strides the figure approached that his face was concealed by a mask at length he reached the side of the bed at which the conte slept and gently divided the curtains victoria firmly now believed some evil was intended yet feared to awaken berenza left his surprise and alarm by depriving him of requisite presence of mind should hasten any attempt against him which she hoped herself by being awake and remaining tranquil to circumvent the intruder now stood at the side of the bed and </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> and paused then stooping down he examined earnestly the face of the conte the countenance of victoria he could not see for her arm was thrown over her head in such a manner that her hand concealed her eyes though she could observe all that passed and the lower part of her face was shaded by the covering the stranger however appeared to imagine that she slept for drawing a dagger from his bosom he waved it to and fro near the closed eyes of the unconscious berenza then gently uncovering his bosom approached the point of the dagger towards it his hand appeared to tremble he stifled a sigh and retreated a few steps then again he drew near with his left hand he held back the curtain and raising his right as if with sudden resolution he prepared to strike just as the dagger was descending the undaunted and watchful victoria caught his wrist the force of the intended blow being thus broken the assassin who was in an inclining attitude lost his equilibrium and falling across the bed the point of the dagger entered the shoulder of victoria at this instant the conte awakened his first impulse was to seize the man but he struggled violently and berenza being unable to obtain a firm hold shackled as he was by the weight of his body which lay across him he contrived swiftly to disengage himself ashe did so he could not however prevent his mask from falling off he sought to recover it and rush from the spot but ere he could atchieve his purpose the eyes of the wounded and fainting victoria were rivetted upon a countenance that memory immediately identified for her brotherthat brother who on the desertion of his mother from her home had fled the paternal roof and now was recognised as an intended murderer monstrous assassin she feebly exclaimed while leonardo with horror depicted in his countenance fled across the apartment and gaining the window appeared to precipitate himself from it berenza now released started from the bed but as he was flying after the assassin a faint groan from victoria arrested him he turned and beheld the bedclothes dyed in blood the sight distracted himyou are wounded my life he franticly exclaimed only slightly my lord murmured victoria but i doi do not regret it berenza in agony vociferated for assistance he dispatched the servants fifty different ways for medical aid then taking victoria in his arms he examined the wound while the big tears of love and anguish fell upon her bosom hah do not weep berenza faintly ejaculated victoria i would suffer ten thousand times more to prove my love to theenay i rejoice to prove it and in fact victoria did rejoice for she felt that the wound obtained in defence of her lovers life and of which her firm mind entertained no apprehensions would bind his inseparably to herthe triumph she experienced then when she beheld his violent anguish more than repaid her for the pain she felt she essayed to take his hand and press it to her bosom but all her firmness all her contempt of pain could not conquer the weakness of nature and she fainted from loss of blood the conte was half mad the medical men arrived they dressed the wound they announced that it was not dangerous and that repose and quiet would in all probability avert the appearance of fever by degrees she was recovered from her temporary insensibility the conte seated himself by her bedside and gazed in agony upon her she turned her eyes upon him the brilliancy of which had given place to a seducing languor that penetrated berenzas inmost soul and in his mind he vowed that his whole life henceforth should be dedicated to her happiness he now felt that she was dearer far dearer to him than he had ever imagined on the noble and enthusiastic soul of berenza the conduct of victoria had wrought the most powerful effectsuch cool intrepidity such contempt of her own life in the defence of his the patience nay the pleasure with which she bore the unhappy consequences of her couragewhat woman in existence thought he would have done thus much for me these reflections swelled his heart with a love almost idolatrous and his violent feeling sought relief in an irrepressible gush of tears victoria determined carefully to conceal from her lover her conviction that the intended assassin was her brother a certain indefinable feeling prevented her from confessing her knowledge and she was fain to rejoice in his escape but of his motives for an attempt so heinous she could form not the smallest idea as for berenza he merely concluded that he was some daring and determined robber who might easily have obtained an entrance into the house during the careless festivity that had generally prevailed during the evening but respecting a circumstance that he now deemed immaterial he gave himself but little concern his whole thoughts were concentred in victoria and he looked forward with impatient anxiety to the much desired period of her recovery scarcely could he be prevailed on to quit her bedside even to obtain necessary repose and what little food he could be induced to take was taken without stirring from her chamber in a few days however to reward such unwearied anxiety victoria was enabled to leave her bed and by marks of attachment apparently more strong than ever repaid the care and tenderness of her lover raised by her seducing manners to a pitch of enthusiasm berenza sometimes wavered in his pride and almost determined that he would make her his wife the moment that her reestablished health should permit him to do so one day while sitting with her in her apartment a fortnight having nearly elapsed since the accident </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> accident which had confined her there a letter was delivered by a servant into his handsopening it he read as follows wretch by the time you receive this i shall be far from pursuit if such your meanness or your revenge should lead you to attempt know that it was i who directed to your faithless and unworthy breast that hand which failed in executing its officeit was i who intended and who hoped that the accursed stiletto which erred in its duty should have found a bloody sheath in the recesses of your heart yes miscreant it was regalia strozzi who beheld you on the laguna accompanied by the minion whose temerity robbed her of your loveth and if a look could kill mine should have blasted her to the earth what durst you openly exhibit your novelty and believe that your audacity would remain unpunished did you not know me you should have carefully guarded your late found gem you should not have suffered her to sparkle in the light of day in the eyes of strozzi but she and even you for the present have eluded my vengeanceyet ha my heart beats it revives in the faint hope that she perhaps may not have escaped if it be not so nothing shall bind me to life but the dearly cherished hope that the time will yet arrive when no barrier shall intercept the blow i would aim at your lifeno not even the hated form of your newly acquired love couldest thou indeed hope fond fool that with impunity thou lightest despise the passion and insult the feelings of messalina strozzi vile and abandoned wanton exclaimed berenza his it then even so and is it to thee and to thy absurd and insolent jealousy that i am to attribute my present misfortune but it is well he continued the worthless fury will molest us no more she has left venice as he concluded he gave the letter to victoria who after hastily perusing it exclaimed that look that look then which so strongly impressed my mind is now accounted forest was megalena strozzi who would have blasted me to the earth then turning towards berenza she explained to him the circumstance to which she alluded and which at the moment of its occurrence so forcibly called her attention nay had even employed her thoughts just before the projected attempt upon his life took place while she spoke berenza did indeed recognize the vindictive florentine but anxiously though silently did victoria ransack her brain to discover what connection could possibly subsist between this female and her brother a connection evidently of no slight nature that could already so deeply have influenced his character and conduct as to drive him to the intended commission of murder to the very brink of destruction for her sake recurring frequently to vain surmises upon this subject and rapidly recovering from the effects of her wound for the present let us leave her to explain certain events which will carry us back to an earlier period of this history it may be remembered that when detailing the misfortunes which befel the family of loredani in consequence of the desertion of laurina from her husband and children to the arms of an adulterer we related at that epoch the sudden flight of the young leonardo from his paternal roof to which he had never more returned it is his progress from that time and the events which led him ultimately to determine on the commission of the most horrible of crimes that we are now going briefly to revert to the high and susceptible feelings which actuated the bosom of this youth when little more than sixteen years of age caused him under their uncontroulable influence to rush from the house of his father as soon ashe learned the unfortunate dereliction from the path of honour of his other parent scarcely to the youth himself were his sensations definable but his naturally soaring spirit unbroken by restraint strengthened too by the high notions of family honour which the marchese had delighted to inculcate in the heir of his house and fortunes gave him a feeling confused and agonized that to remain longer on the spot where his mother had heaped disgrace upon her ruined family would be vile and unworthy impressed with this idea he took his rash determination it was to fly from venice never perhaps to behold it more in the shortest possible time he endeavoured to accelerate his distance from a city now grown hateful to him and to lose by motion and change of scene the uneasy reflections that oppressed his proud but noble heart even to fly from venice was not enough to remain near it was death to his soul nor did he for an hour intermit the rapidity of his movements until almost without knowing certainly without designing it he found himself in the delightful country of tuscany awakened to cooler recollection there then he energetically exclaimed there then i may breathe without an oppression of the heartand here too necessity compelled him to rest for the enthusiastic youth careless of the future when he left his luxurious home was but scantily supplied with money and all he had possessed was by this time expended hand what then he cried as sober reason suggested this reflection to his mindbetter to die an exile in the furthest corner of the globebetter to die in poverty and want than live in a luxury which the soul despises it was evening and the young leonardo reclined pensively on the bank of the majestic arnothe sun had sunk in the west and misty shadows were collecting upon the mountains for the first time he began to reflect upon his situation whither he must now continue to bend his steps and how he should support </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> support life having thus cast himself upon a friendless world his thoughts became painful and embarrassinghe sought again to lose them in activity and sprang hastily from his recumbent posture he had not proceeded far ere he beheld a large and elegant mansion which from the extreme beauty of its architecture standing too wholly by itself rivetted his attention he continued to approach and when he drew near stopped involuntarily to contemplate it while he was thus employed a gentleman of a noble and superior appearance came from the house and being attracted by the animated countenance and figure of leonardo he was induced to approach him and enquire by what chance he had wandered to this beautiful solitude leonardo replied firmly and without hesitation that he was a youth whom misfortunes not to be explained had driven from his home and that he was straying he neither knew nor was solicitous whither struck by the singularity of this reply in which there was something to interest an expanded mind the stranger who was called signor zappi felt impelled to increase if possible his acquaintance with the youth whom chance had thus introduced to his attention well my young friend he said if you will enter my mansion which seems to have attracted your notice we may have some conversation that perhaps may not prove unsatisfactory to either of us your appearance and manner please me and i should feel happy to know more of you to this frank invitation the warm hearted youth readily assented and accepting with an ingenuous air the proffered hand of signor zappi they entered the house together leonardo was conducted into an elegant apartment where desiring him to be seated signor zappi enquired of him if he stood in need of refreshment leonardo replied in the negative some indifferent conversation then ensued when though with the utmost delicacy his liberal host expressed a desire to be informed of his name the youth blushedmy name he replied his leonardothat which is subjoined to it i must be excused from revealing circumstances have impelled me to leave my home and as i feel it impossible signor utterly impossible he added rising hastily from his chair sto gratify a curiosity so proper and so natural for you to feel respecting one you have admitted beneath your roof i will with your permission take my leave and no longer intrude upon your hospitality that must not be indeed my young friend answered signor zappithere is that in your appearance and manner as i have said which interests me considerablykeep then your secret if you wish it and since you are avowedly at present a child of fortune indifferent and undecided whither you bend your course remain for a short time where chance has directed you and forbear young and enthusiastic as you appear to cast yourself upon the careless world leonardos heart was penetrated with gratitude at the kind words of the benevolent stranger his dreadful and as he conceived it disgraceful family secret his pride shrunk from acknowledging but feeling in an instant the good fortune he experienced in having met in the forlornness of his situation one who appeared inclined to befriend him he cast himself at the feet of zappi unable to restrain his tears this excellent being whose philanthropic heart led him to seek every opportunity not only of befriending his species but if possible of preserving them from ill was deeply affected that the nature of the youth was noble he easily conceivedthat some sentiment of a high and honourable though perhaps misguided tendency had induced him to fly his home he likewise believed therefore gently raising him in his arms he said come then leonardo desire to know you by no other namecome let us quit this room and as the son of a friend i will introduce you to my wife and daughter the wife of zappi however chanced to be in every respect the reverse of her husband for she possessed an intriguing spirit and a profligate heart but it is not intended to dwell minutely upon every progressive incident that befel the young leonardo to skim lightly on the contrary over all excepting that which led to his connection with regalia strozzi is the present purpose the signor zappi then daily grew more attached to the youth of his adoptionwhen absent his conversation to his wife teemed with his praises when present he continually sought modes of drawing forth his character and every trait he discovered added to the warm impression that his pristine ingenuousness had made upon his benevolent mind it so happened unfortunately that zappi was not singular in his admiration of the youth for he had not been very long an inmate in his house before the signora zappi became a warmer eulogist in his favour than even her husband she paid him beside the most pointed attentions yet it was not his ardent character his talents or his virtues which attracted her distinguished regarding it was the charms of his person the beauty of his form and face which had drawn towards him her attention and true it is they displayed a manliness and grace far above his years yet not similarly disposed in her favour was the object of her growing passion his admiration his thoughts and all he knew of love was bestowed upon amamia her lovely and more approximating daughter this to her dismay the wife of zappi soon discovered but bent upon carrying her point she resorted to all the fascination of dress to all the allurements of softness and the most tender attentionsthat all this too might the more forcibly impress his mind she as much as possible upon various pretexts removed the fair amamia from his view still all was unavailing the youth felt gratitude for the kindnesses shewn him by the </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> the wife of his friend but he felt no more about a year had now elapsed since his first introduction to the house of zappi yet still the secret of his alienation from home was locked in the recesses of his heart guarded by an impenetrable aegis of punctilious pride and delicacy the good zappi indeed had long ceased to hint at any desire for information upon the subject he felt happy in the society of the youth and he required no painful acknowledgments on his side for the friendship he had delighted to shew him he had never yet from any act or any conduct of leonardo had occasion to regret his inmate in his family no trait of vice of meanness or ingratitude had ever yet exhibited themselves in his character zappi was a plain and pure professor of morality as well as a benevolent being and if he had had reason to suspect aught amiss in the heart of his young friend painful as would have been the task he would have felt it his duty to drive him from beneath his roof left by appearing to protect and cherish vice he should inculcate lessons of dangerous tendency into the mind of his daughter and by an inevitable progression injure rather than benefit society the passion of zappis wife had by this time grown to such a height that she felt it utterly impossible longer to conceal it from the object that had inspired itshe determined therefore whatever the consequence to make it known to him for this purpose she seized an opportunity when her husband and the fair amamia were absent to follow him into the garden whither he had retired to think without interruption and with all the enthusiasm of an innocent first love upon his mistress as he reclined upon a seat he beheld coming towards him the mother of her he loved and respectfully he would have arisen but as she drew near him gently laying her hand upon his shoulder she prevented him from doing so and seated herself beside him you were absorbed in thought leonardo said she i was indeed answered the youth blushing you were thinking of her you love i would wager pursued the wanton wife of zappi and heaved a sigh fixing upon him her eyes at the same time in which were depicted the troubled emotions of her agitated soul leonardo who was thinking of amamia reechoed her sigh the sigh was electric fluid through her breast and fanned the fires which were raging in her heart she took his hand and fervently pressing it said you are beloved in returned leonardo most charming of youths you are indeed beloved hare you certain replied the transported boy springing from his recumbent attitude soh i am but too certain franticly replied the degraded female falling at his feet and thrown completely off her guardyou are belovedoh how madly by me by you signora cried the astonished youth you jest surelyrise rise i beseech you from your unbecoming postureunbecoming towards me he sternly added soh leonardo i love i adore you cried the abandoned wife spurn me not then i conjure you for i cannot cannot conquer the fatal passion with which you have inspired me signora zappi you strike me with horror exclaimed the youthit is your daughter it is your blooming daughter that i love whatand will you never love me boy in an accent of rage and grief she cried no never while i have breath never emphatically replied leonardo disengaging himself from her wild embrace hallow me if possible to respect you curses then seize thee miscreant shrieked the wife of zappi in an agony of rage and disappointment and casting him from her with vehemence i will live to blast thee for this most infamous of women returned leonardo passionately let me fly from thy loathed presencelet me again in the wide world seek a refuge from infamy and shame for infamy it is to be the object of thy love so saying with impetuosity he rushed from the spot and would have fled from the house altogether but that a thought of amamia darting across his mind he felt an irresistible desire to see her once more ere he quitted for ever a roof that had sheltered him so long he therefore hastened to his chamber where he determined to abide till the arrival of zappi and his daughter mean time his disappointed enamorata rendered half frantic by the contempt and indignation with which her abandoned overtures had been received resolved in the tumultuous vengeance of her soul to destroy and blacken the youth whose virtue she had failed to corruptor it was not virtue that actuated him but merely that the temptation offered him was not sufficient to seduce it still the reflection was in either case maddening and humiliating and how she might most bitterly cause him to repent his conduct was now her sole consideration at length the demon of hate and revenge suggested to her a plan sufficiently diabolical with eager and triumphant malice she instantly began tearing her apparel to tatters then taking some gravel between her hands careless of pain in pursuance of her revenge she rubbed it with violence over her face and hands till the blood flowed and in this state determined to await the return of her husband presently she heard him arrive she flew round the garden and as he entered the house met him at the door and cast herself as if in an agony of shame and horror before him zappi who tenderly loved his wife was shocked and dismayed he caused her to be carried into the house and laid upon a bed and then tremblingly entreated to be informed what terrible event had befallen her the false and unworthy wife then </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> then motioned for every one to withdraw and pressing with seeming love and agitation his hand to her lips she replied thus to his anxious enquiries soh my beloved husband that scorpion we have nourished so long behold what has been our reward it is to that audacious that hypocritical stripling you must attribute what you now behold finding me alone in the garden he first presumed to insult me with professions of a dishonourable loves rebuked the saucy boy and attempted to rise when suddenly seizing me in his arms i soon found my strength unequal to his i shrieked aloud he became i suppose apprehensive of discovery and fled from the garden leaving his infamous purpose unaccomplished the wife of zappi ceased and bursting into tears as if oppressed with a sense of shame covered her face with her hands depraved ungrateful viper exclaimed the deluded zappi could i ever have imagined of thee this but instantly shall heno first he shall appear before us and be forced to reply whether sudden madness or deliberate villainy impelled to this criminal attempt so saying zappi summoning a servant bade him tell the young leonardo that his presence was immediately desired at this mandate the infamous wife of zappi felt somewhat alarmed but resolving to persevere in her plot she offered no objection in the course of a few moments the youth entered the room he started on beholding the maimed figure of his accuser but his step was firm and unhesitating his eye was open and on his blooming cheek guilt had set no mark wretch began signor zappi unmindful of these appearances tallying so little with imputed crime wretch dare you to appear before me with that audacious front see there your work young but most infamous monster so green in years so old in the basest profligacy whatmight not the wife of your benefactor have been held sacred by you durst you endeavour to break through the nearest and the dearest connections that are respected between man and man could you trample thus on every principle of honour and of gratitude attempt the subversion of moral order and trespass upon sacred social affinities worthless profligate and unfeeling boy quit instantly a roof which has sheltered you too long and never let me more behold your face during this bitter language which was addressed to him leonardo made no attempt to speak he folded his arms upon his bosom and as the deluded zappi proceeded he saw the depth of the plot which had been imagined against him by his depraved wife the instinctive pride however of his nature spurned at the unmerited imputations which had been cast upon him and the poignant invective with which they were accompanied he scorned proudly scorned to attempt a vindication and perhaps a magnanimous sentiment of gratitude made him desire to spare his friend and benefactor too accurate information of his wifes depravity if such his indignation would have allowed him to listen to therefore when he perceived that he had concluded in a gentle but firm voice he thus replied i am ready signor zappi to depart your house i thank you for all the favours you have conferred on me and wish you may never experience from others greater ingratitude than you have met from me so saying he bowed respectfully and moved towards the door yet ere he quitted the room turning his eyes full upon the wife of zappi he looked at her for a moment with such dignity and scorn blended that her soul trembled within her and involuntarily she passed her hand over her eyes with firm and majestic step he then retired his first impulse led him to the chamber he had been taught to call his therewith swelling heart but tearless eye he placed with indignant eagerness upon a table every trinket he had about him which his benefactor in the plenitude of fond affection had bestowed upon him of money he retained not a marevedi then unlocking a drawer where on first becoming an inmate in the house of signor zappi he had deposited from a certain feeling at the moment indefinable the clothes which he had worn on entering it and the only ones he possessed he cast off hastily those in which he was now clad and substituted for them such of his own as his increased height and bulk would allow him to make use of bitterly did it corrode the heart of the youth that he could not in like manner return every benefit he had received yet since that was impossible he could only determine to retain nothing that might be resigned then surveying himself from head to foot with a mingled feeling he exclaimed these are my own all too that i can well call mineoh mother motherfor this may i thank thee becoming now more violently agitated from succeeding reflections he rushed from the chamber and fled hastily through the house once he flopped with the fond wish to take a last leave of the fair amamia but on the recollection that he must either expose to her the infamy of her mother or himself appear culpable in her eyes he conquered the impulse and pursued his way hastily across the garden anxious to lose sight of the house he halted not till he found himself at a considerable distance from it and had walked at a rapid pace for several hours actual weariness at length compelled him for a moment to rest the energy of his mind had till now supported him he became conscious that he had walked many miles nature felt overpowered and reluctantly he seated himself at the foot of a tree uneasy reflections began to enter his mind with his head reclining on his hand involuntarily he suffered a deep gloom to take </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> take possession of him it was past noon when he quitted the abode of zappi he now strained his tearful eyes and beheld the east beginning to be obscured by the shades of evening his oppression increased but his strength of mind shewed him the necessity of combating it he started on his feet and turned his face to the west there he beheld the glorious sun declining indeed but declining in a blaze of radiance the sky around represented a thousand brilliant figures the tops of the mountains catching the last rays reflected many different degrees of light and shade the youth felt no longer overcome by melancholy his heart cheared painful ideas gave place to indefinite hopes and he determined that he would no more indulge in the weakness of useless regret pursuing a path that chance alone directed he soon found himself winding among those beautiful mountains whose fruitful bosoms are covered with olive and the luxurious vine wherever a beautiful villa met his eye instinctively he turned aside the shades of evening began to thicken and the young exile from home was still unsheltered for the night at length wandering onwards he beheld situated in a kind of glen a small and low roofed cottage to perceive it fully it was even necessary to ascend a considerable way the mountain at the foot of which it humbly rose it was embosomed by trees and surrounded by a garden seeming the abode of industrious poverty rather than the seclusion of romantic whim at all events leonardo shunned it not but resolved to investigate it nearer and ascertain by whom it was inhabited as he continued to approach the voice of moaning and distress founded on his ear this hastened his steps and he speedily gained the little narrow path which led to the cottage there seated on the outside of the door he beheld an aged female weeping and wringing her hands sorrow was in unison with the heart of the youth and in a gentle voice he asked if her grief might admit of consolation and assistance alas no she answered redoubling her tears death admits no remedy it has deprived me of my only hope and comfort in this worlds my poor hugo my darling sonoh signor that he should go before me who now will support my tottering limbswho provide for the short remnant of my dayswho work for who befriend the poor forsaken nina but weep not so bitterly good mother said leonardo admit me into your cottage and if you will be kind enough to give me a draught of milk we will talk further upon the subject of your sorrow perhaps things may not prove so bad as you at this moment apprehend the voice of consolation is always sweet but doubly sweet when coming from buoyant youth to age the poor nina rose with the utmost alacrity she possessed from her seat and hobbling into her cottage she set in silence before him while her tears continued though more slowly to flow the best that her cottage afforded when leonardo had a little satisfied his hunger for the almost unremitting fatigue he had undergone for the last seven or eight hours had completely exhausted him he took the hand of his aged hostess who involuntarily had seated herself beside him and said tell me my good mother how old was your son hugo she was twenty signor on the blessed day of saint gilbert hand tell me nina but nina would not allow him to proceed soh santo pedro was he not everything to poor ninasignor i have a little garden and hugo it was who turned it to account i have a vineyard too and hugo looked to it but he would seldom leave his aged mother signor for mothers would he say nit is better to give this or that or a little upon what we dispose of to pietro or varro and let them manage for us than for me to leave you mother who cant well help yourselfsignor i have lately got a little the better of a terrible pain in my poor limbs and nowoh misericordia to lose my staff my dear boyoh signor i vex my heart and think he worked beyond his strength for he was always weak and sickly from a dea child here poor nina was interrupted by her tears at the recollection of what her son had been to her an idea had entered the mind of leonardo while she spoke which every moment acquired fresh force from a view of its eligibility garden to cultivated vineyard to attend tono occasion for public exposition in the market or even the townher son in a declining state too and yet capable of doing all that was necessary to be donesurely i he turned towards nina who was still bitterly lamenting come worthy nina dry up your tearswhat if i could supply to you the place of your son would you allow me to remain under your roof and accept of my best endeavours soh ciel be praised be adored for this joyfully exclaimed the aged nina dropping on her knees and fervently kissing the ground soh as i live my heart began to feel lighter the instant i set my eyes upon you and though i did continue to weep signor weeping again for my dear lost son hugo yet i vow and protest by the blessed maria i felt as if a ray of light shot through my breast well rise now my good nina and let us talk further nina trembling arose you must give me some instructions my good nina for though i understand sufficient of gardening there are many things i shall require you to explain tome this nina her heart almost bursting with conflicting joy and regret joy that </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> that she had found a protector and regret that she had lost one readily promised some necessary conversation then ensued and leonardo feeling within himself no doubt of success in his new situation consented at an early hour to retire to repose sensible of intense fatigue from the exertion of the day the aged nina conducted him to the little chamber which had appertained to her deceased son and with a heart infinitely lightened leonardo took possession of the homely bed which it contained as he reclined his head upon the pillow this is the second time he exclaimed that the heir of loredani has been indebted to the benevolence of strangers for shelter that the humanity of strangers has compassionate his forlornness and that the bounty of strangers has cherished and protected him oh mothermother unkind to thee and thee alone do i owe all this with this bitter though just reflection burning at his heart he fell asleep and had the son of laurina expired in that sleep he would have appeared at the bar of heaven with an accusation against his mother registered in his heartlet other mothers tremble at this reflection and pause on meditated guilt at an early hour the following morning leonardo awakened and immediately repaired to the garden to enter upon his selfallotted task while in the mansion of zappi he had obtained considerable knowledge with respect to gardening from having at leisure hours resorted toit as an amusement signor zappi likewise felt pleasure in giving him instructions because he himself passed much of his time in botanising in planting and trying various experiments upon the fecund earth the young leonardo had additional motives to strengthen his perseverance for he felt though he should in reality reap the benefit of his own exertions that he laid himself under no obligations to be again bitter reflection reproached with them he repaid by the service he rendered the benefit he received his proud heart was therefore at rest and his spirit became even buoyant with pleasing anticipations that banished for a time the recollection of his real woeswoes no less real because his peculiar sentiments whether romantic or otherwise induced him to prefer their pressure to the ease and splendor which he would have deemed disgrace and infamy nothing assuredly calms the mind like a settled purpose leonardo had determined to persevere while circumstances should render it expedient in a course of labor and activity each successive day brought with it lighter because more habitual toil with an increase of pleasure to his heart in the conviction of being no idle member of society in his knowledge superior to that of hugo the poor nina soon discerned a multiplied advantage every thing flourished beneath his fostering hand and excellent arrangement his mind warm and enthusiastic slackened not in the pursuit of his object he became gradually enamoured of his peaceful innocent and industrious lifehis humble retirement and total seclusion from the world he felt no want he received no favor he beheld the little store of the aged nina daily increasing and while he experienced the sweet reward of constant employ his heart bounded for the first time with the exulting consciousness of being useful to a fellowcreature he anticipated the future however with a feeling of melancholy his uncertain destination occasionally employed his thoughts can i always remain thus he would exclaim alas no yet surely these are halcyon days but still i have an unquenched sentiment in my soul that tells me this for ever though in itself laudable would be but an inglorious life for the heir of loredani what said i the heir or loredani is disgraced he may be happy he may be honored in the shade but despised contemned if he offers to emerge in the betraying light of day no no loredani the world is no place for thee in thine own character never mayest thou appear among men these reflections sometimes overwhelmed his mind with gloom he had then no refuge but in redoubled activity resolving to allow himself no leisure for useless anticipation of future fate it happened however one morning that the aged nina complained of an unwonted sensation towards noon it amounted to indisposition and leonardo whom she had ever called her son assisted her to her bed from which she was doomed never more to arise of this in a few hours the worthy creature became conscious she felt undeniable symptoms of approaching dissolution and knew them for what they were alas said she feebly to the youth leonardo i feel my beloved my second son that i have not long to survive my dear hugo let me behold thy sweet face in the moment of death and let me bless thee with my last breath leonardo was deeply affected he beheld on the point of departing for ever her who had admitted him unhesitatingly beneath her humble roof to a share of her little comforts to the disposition of her trifling all true the event had rewarded her kindness but that was not the consideration of the moment of her genuine hospitalitycould he then forsake her lonely pillow no longer than to procure every assistance every necessary that might contribute to her ease or tend perhaps to revive the feeble embers yet lingering of life but vain were his attentions vain his endeavours ere long extinct became every hope after some hours of painful watching by her bedside during which she had not spoken and her breath had been heard to fluctuate she in a low and almost inarticulate voice desired leonardo to raise her in his arms he obeyed with tender anxiety hall i have is thine she murmured making an effort to open her eyes and fix upon him her last look no sooner had she beheld that ingenuous countenance then her wishes </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> wishes seemed fulfilled her head sunk heavy on his bosom and she expired in his arms with the serenity of a child great was the grief of leonardo he summoned her few friends and neighbours who occupied here and there a cottage on the mountain to perform the last sad offices for his humble but affectionate friend and feeling now the inutility of remaining on the spot he resolved to defer his departure only till he had seen her decently consigned to the earth in a few days therefore leonardo dividing her flight possessions among those who had obeyed his call at her decease and reserving to himself only a trifling sum of money the produce of his own labor since he had resided beneath her roof he left the simple cottage where he had passed some happy hours and furnished with a small stock of provisions once more renewed his wanderings of shelter for the night he was no longer solicitous for his late toil and regular healthful habits had so far increased his hardihood and vigor that he no longer shrunk at reposing in the open air nor would he he resolved while possessed of sufficient for half a meal attempt to enter the habitation of man night at length overtook him he threw himself carelessly upon the earth and began to reflect the vagueness of his own intentions the desultoriness of his mode of life forcibly struck him nit is now two years and three months thought he since i left my native city of venicesince i left the disgraced abode of my fatherthat dear that tender father who so much loved me since that i have been once accused of the most dreadful crimes and driven with ignominy from the shelter to which i had no claim then have i been inured to poverty and toil and earned my bread like the meanest peasant by the sweat of my brow now am i again an outcast on the wide expanse of creation no friend no home nor a prospect of obtaining bread for tomorrows subsistence oh mother and all this for thee he exclaimed clasping his hands fervently together through thee have i endured all this now the probable fate of that mother how his father had supported her loss and the situation of his sister with a thousand dear and tender recollections pressed upon his mind the fond wish of revisiting his home flashed across his mind but scarcely at first would he admit the idea irresistibly however it hung around his heart hand why not then said heat length in an eager voice why not as he contemplated the alteration of his appearance who in the present hardy leonardo robust by toil embroiled by the fierce rays of the midday sun and habited too in the coarse costume of the humble peasant shall trace the once luxurious heir of loredani yes i am determined he pursued starting on his feet i may with safety without danger of being known once more revisit my home i can satisfy my mind respecting my unfortunate family and then take of it an eternal adieu he walked rapidly a few steps forgetting in the enthusiasm of the moment that it was night at length he grew calm nearly in the morning then said he mentally meantime here is my bed once more he cast himself upon the earth and sleep stealing over him soon calmed the agitation of his mind prompt was the decision and prompt ever the execution of leonardo leaving at early dawn the mountains of tuscany behind him he pursued his journey with the most eager rapidity that his humble means would allow ever cautious that no one should suspect him for other than he appeared who can describe his sensations when he found himself even near the city of venice yet he resolved not to enter it during the day and when he arrived at padua determined to proceed as far as he could on foot thinking by this means that it would be impossible for him to reach venice before nightfall curbing his impatience therefore after taking some slight refreshment he deliberately set out on his allotted task but notwithstanding that he walked as he conceived at a moderate pace by the time he reached the extremity of the terra firma he perceived the sun still far above the western hemisphere he continued therefore slowly to wander along the borders of the lake idly stopping to remark whatever villa or splendid domain attracted his eye of which the venetian nobility have many on the terra firma at length however feeling somewhat weary he threw himself upon the bed of the earth to him no longer unfamiliar as such and fell as usual into a train of thought tears involuntarily filled his eyes and coursed each other down his cheeks he closed those eyes filled as they were with tears and ruminated over the sorrows of his youth ah tears painful as you were as yet rising from an unpolluted heart from a heart though bursting with grief yet unstained by guilt why why must it so soon become changed destroyed and plunged into an abyss of shame and infamy why art thou doomed leonardo to add another blot to the page which registers laurinas crimes nature will often become exhausted by the intenseness of its own sensations leonardo sunk by degrees from keen feeling into a temporary insensibility a soft sleep stole over his faculties and he forgot for a time the unhappiness of his situation while unconsciously he thus reposed a female chanced to wander near the spot she had quitted her house for the purpose of enjoying more fully the fresco of the evening and to stroll along the banks of the lake the young leonardo however arrested her attention and she softly approached </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> approached to contemplate himhis hands were clasped over his head and on his cheek where the hand of health had planted her brownred rose the pearly gems of his tears still hunghis auburn hair sported in graceful curls about his forehead and temples agitated by the passing breezehis vermeil lips were half open and disclosed his polished teeth his bosom which he had uncovered to admit the refreshing air remained disclosed and contrasted by its snowy whiteness the animated hue of his complexion beautiful and fascinating though in the simple garb of a peasant did the wondering female consider the youth before her struck with lively admiration she knew not how to quit the spot when an insect suddenly alighting on his cheek he started and awakedsomewhat confused he hastily arose for the female that met his eyes appeared to him supremely beautiful approaching him gently and with a smile she laid her hand upon his arm and in a gentle voice said you appear a stranger here and though your dress bespeaks inferiority of situation pardon me if i distrust what it seems meant to convey without therefore deeming me impertinently curious allow me to inquire whither you intend to bend your course as the evening is already far advanced and i know not of any house near this that could yield you accommodation for the night this was the first beautiful and attractive female save the innocent amamia whose attraction too was of a nature wholly different to that of hers before him who had ever addressed herself to the warm imagination of leonardo his cheeks became suffused with deepening blushes and his eyes with which he longed to gaze upon her were yet cast bashfully towards the earth in a faultering voice he replied while every consideration but of the object before him vanished from his mind i have no i have not any particular destination for this night signora but i havens have it in contemplation where to bend my course soon at least i am solicitous he flopped unable to proceed from a confusion of idea well but then in a voice of tender anxiety answered megalena strozzi for her it was who addressed the youth if you are not absolutely decidedly you are not particularly desirous of proceeding further tonight perhaps you will for the present deign to enter my villa and allow me the happiness of offering you a dwelling for the night leonardo raised his eyes and was about to reply come i perceive you will not deny me gaily resumed the fair florentine taking him lightly by the arm and leading him onwards my house is buta small distance from hence look you may behold it as you stand she added pointing with her finger to a small and beautiful edifice built in the form of a pavilion impossible lovely signora to refuse you any thing said the youth enthusiastic at her charms and the gracefulness of her manner impossible to refuse you any thing the fair florentine only smiled and proceeded with alacrity as though apprehensive that the youth should retract they soon reached the villa and a smothered sigh as he entered it was the last tribute paid to the memory of his neglected home the character of megalena strozzi has already been so far revealed that to amplify upon it here or the excesses into which it perpetually hurried her would be vain suffice it to say that enraptured with the novel graces of the young leonardo she spared no artifice or allurement to induce him to protract his stay beneath her roof she devoted herself to fascinate and seduce him and day after day contrived fresh causes to prevent his departure by degrees these artifices as megalena had hoped they would became unnecessary it was now him who forbore to press the subject who sought excuses to remain and who constantly trembled left the necessity of departing should be pointed out to him it was not with the beautiful megalena as with the profligate wife of zappi for though equally depraved herself she knew better how to disguise beneath an artificial delicacy and refinement the tumultuous wishes of her heart it was not vainly then that she sought to seduce the imagination and lure the senses of the youth no he had in his own highwrought feelings in his susceptible soul powerful and treacherous advocates in her cause he beheld her with a mixed sentiment of admiration and passion far different to the sentiments with which he had regarded the young amamia those he had entertained for her were innocent peaceful and refined for megalena turbulent painful wild her charms kindled his soul amamias had filled it with a halcyon tenderness his sensations for the one were like the burning heat of a fierce meridian sun for the other like the gentle calmness of a summer eve megalena who had only retired to the villa which she at present occupied with the intent to remain there for a few days and that merely on account of a slight quarrel that she had had with conte berenza wherein she had bitterly reproached him for the infrequency of his visits to her now forgetting the cause of chagrin that had induced her to leave venice found herself from the delightful chance that had introduced leonardo to her inclined to protract her stay far beyond what she had originally intended it so happened that about this time berenza had recovered his beloved victoria the absence therefore of the fair megalena remained not only unnoticed but unknown while she secretly congratulated herself upon the revenge she believed herself to be taking upon the indifference of berenza towards her yet indifferent as he was the florentine could not forget that she had loved him once with a passion almost equal to that which she now </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> now felt for leonardo and whether or not he still continued to repay her diminished regards with all the ardent gratitude she had the vanity to conceive her due for having once preferred him to all other men she vowed in her heart that the hour in which she should discover in him a preference to another should bethe last of his existence yet for her own conduct she had no standard but her wishes inconstancy and duplicity towards him from whom she presumed to require such implicit devotion were esteemed as nothing her excesses her irregularities if she had ingenuity enough to conceal them from his knowledge she considered perfectly allowable and far from affording to berenza a sufficient excuse for attaching himself elsewhere with these sentiments she gave unbounded latitude to her passion for leonardo and to such an excess did it speedily arrive that she almost felt as if for him she could resign every other man three months had now elapsed since leonardo fatally for himself had become known to the syren megalena he was not yet nineteen megalena was his senior by several years yet so far had her fullgrown but unfaded charms her playful yet elegant manners her various seductive blandishments obtained the ascendancy over his imagination that the bare idea of separating from her became to him at length distraction she had bewitched and enslaved his heart she had awakened his soul to new existence the image of the delicate amamia faded from his mind and a more wild a more unbounded passion took possession of it in the form of megalena with a novel delight superior to aught she had ever felt at any former conquest did the artful florentine behold her triumph she had sown as she believed the first germs of love and passion in a pure youthful breast she had seen those germs shoot forth and expand beneath the fervid rays of her influence and she enjoyed the fruits with a voluptuous pleasure at length however the vanity of her sex became predominant assured of the perfect regard of leonardo enamoured of his beauty and proud of her conquest she had yet another feeling to gratify she longed to exhibit him at venice to the females of her acquaintance to excite their envy and their admiration for of their attractions she entertained no fear no dread of rivalry with herself had the haughty florentine but how to conceal from berenza her new and highly prized lovershe resolved then to let her return to venice remain a secret to him and in order to maintain it such go but little from home this point determined on she expressed to leonardo her desire to revisit venice at the mention of venice he became visibly agitated the colour forsook his cheeks and returned to them again with deepened dye that very event which he had a little time before so eagerly desired he now contemplated with mingled sensations of terror and reluctance but could he refuse aught to his seducing mistress impossible for her he forgot the firmest purpose of his soul to her he laid open the painful secret which till now with scrupulous care a high mindedness that shrunk from the idea of divulgement he had undeviatingly guarded the secret of his name and family throwing himself into the arms of megalena he acknowledged himself for what he was and hesitatingly expressed his unwillingness openly to revisit venice at least in his proper character hare you then exclaimed megalena the fire of increased exultation sparkling in her eyes hare you then the son of loredani i am beautiful strozzi answered he but dropping on his knees and fervently clasping his hands together guard guard i beseech you the secret which your charms have extracted from me respect my honor my happiness and my life and never by any chance oh never let it transpire from your lips that i am the disgraced the wandering offspring of that unhappy house or that to the name of leonardo i addhis voice faltered i add that of loredani never never solemnly answered the florentine swear it lovely womanswear it ere i rise passionately added leonardo i swear solemnly swear answered megalena laying one hand upon his shoulder and raising the other to heaven i swear never to divulge thy secret to mortal being and in the moment i forget my oath may the lightning of heaven blast me megalena i thank thee cried leonardo fervently rising from his knees and embracing her with a tender solemnity while tears trembled in his eyes i earnestly thank thee for the discovery of my secret i would never survive but you will go to venice then leonardo soh megalena does not my father dwell therehow going with thee might i remain concealed from his knowledge know you not then dear youth that the marchese is no more that event and those which followed are sufficiently known in venice and none of your family at present reside there leonardo heard only the words the marchese is no more his hands were raised in mute anguish to heaven the eloquent tears rolled slowly down his cheeks and emphatically he exclaimed merciful god i thank thee then turning towards megalena he said in a voice of assumed calmness inform me of what you know i can bear to listen the florentine appearing deeply affected at the visible emotion of leonardo stated and certainly with all possible regard to those high and susceptible feelings which she perceived in him whatever had come to her knowledge respecting the occurrences in the family of loredani she concluded her detail which she had rendered as concise and as little painful as possible by again observing as she believed justly that no part of that family resided now in the city of venice soh lostoh miserable mother </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> mother silently ejaculated the youth thou hast completed then the measure of thy crimes adieu for ever to the honor to the happiness of thy children thou hast now blasted them irretrievably to megalena however his smarting pride his anguished feelings suffered him to make no remark his heart was too full it was too towering even in its humility to ask a sharer in such griefs hand wilt thou not then accompany me to the city interrogated megalena again taking his hand and looking fondly in his face eyes yes fair megalena he replied passing his hand hastily across his forehead as if to chase away every uneasy thought eyes i can now do any thing but remember i am only leonardo delighted to have gained her point the florentine promised obedience to his smallest desire anticipated and entered warmly into his every wish arranging with eager facility a plan for his remaining concealed and unknown leonardo yielding to all she proposed hastened from her presence to wander awhile in gloomy retrospection for his mind incapable of recovering immediately from the shock it had sustained required in solitude to wear off its effect and conquer the gloom that oppressed it megalena however determined that her lover should not retract resumed as soon as she again beheld him the subject nearest her heart and fixed the following day for their departure from the villa aqua dolce to whose friendly seclusion she considered herself indebted for pleasure beyond any she had ever enjoyed accordingly in the cool of the evening on the following day they embarked for venice it began to get dusk as they arrived they soon reached her luxurious residence but nothing could remove the oppression which momentarily had been growing upon leonardo increasing at every step that brought him nearer to the place of his nativity megalena perceiving this exerted herself by every tender assiduity and insinuating art to lighten and disperse she welcomed the youthful lover to her home and caused a splendid supper to be prepared at length her powerful influence began to prevail the melancholy of leonardo gave way before it potent goblets of wine assisted her efforts the uselessness of regret becoming manifest to his mind it was displaced by a vivacity resulting rather from the animation imparted to the spirits by wine and luxurious viands than the sober reasoning of philosophy the bland seductress megalena possessed over him an unlimited power she had caused a new world to open on his view even yet he was not awakened from the dream of pleasure with which she had bewitched his soul feelings and ideas unknown before swelled in his bosom and his heart was rapidly becoming immersed in an infatuating sea of voluptuousness megalena to his heated enthusiastic fancy appeared an angel at once beneficent and beautiful jealous of every idea that was not directed to herself she sedulously endeavoured to banish from his mind all painful recurrence to the past to this end she thought it expedient to seek for him amusement and recreation but of a nature that should not involve publicity for in his determination of concealment leonardo continued firm and tremblingly alive to the remotest idea of discovery accordingly at her own house megalena assembled most of her female friends and such of her male acquaintance who while from vacancy they affected to admire her professed not to be lovers to all these she presented her cherished lover as a young florentine and distant relation of her own for even megalena bold and unprincipled as she was did not desire to have known the real circumstances of her acquaintance with leonardo among the visitors that frequented this abode of levity and ignoble pleasure it was not probable that any should be found who had formerly visited at the marchese loredanis yet had such an accident occurred nearly three years of absence from venice joined to the life which he had led amid the mountains of tuscany had so far changed his originally delicate appearance that it would have been almost impossible for any but a near relative to recognise the pampered boy leonardo in the hardy and robustlooking florentine increased to the most elegant stature of the fullgrown man but yet although unknown and undiscovered megalena vainly flattered herself in believing that the tale of his relationship to herself was credited enamoured as she appeared of the eminent beauty of his person and evidently incapable of remaining at ease if for a moment he quitted her presence it required no singular degree of penetration to discern that ties more tender and more animated than those resulting from consanguinity attracted her towards him it so happened that among the females to which the vanity of the florentine incited her to introduce her lover was oneby name theresa this girl was of exquisite beauty but deeply immersed ina stream of vice and dissipation to the further disgrace of megalena it must be acknowledged that she was in a high degree accessary to her fall from virtue the unfortunate girl though she appeared to court her society and to entertain towards her friendship and affection was in her heart deeply sensible of this and when reflection transiently pervaded her wretched mind in the bitterness of an abhorrent halfrepentant spirit she silently cursed the enemy that had betrayed her soon her penetrating and observant eye remarked the fond expression of regard with which megalena strozzi so frequently regarded her lover the concealed exultation with which she viewed him was discovered by the watchful theresa she felt convinced in her mind that he bore no relationship to her excepting that of love if love it might be termed and rejoiced at a prospect of obtaining revenge for the misery that an envying and fallen female had induced her to partake of inspired too by something of passion for </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> for the attractive leonardo she resolved if possible to detach him wholly from her hated associate by courting him to herself eager in the prosecution of this plan she left untried no artifices that could facilitate it she invited megalena frequently to her house and spite of her watchfulness and care contrived to have her attention engaged that she might steal leonardo to her side and hold private conferences with him she appealed as the florentine had done to his imagination and his senses and by younger therefore more blooming charms sought to reduce his heart from its allegiance to her but while theresa angled as she thought thus securely and unsuspected the demon of jealousy had taken possession of the florentines soul enraged to madness at what she saw yet wily and apparently cool with vengeance burning in her breast she resolved still to appear unconscious and see how far the daring treachery of theresa would carry her to this end she forbore to circumvent her various plans to inveigle her lover and while theresa believed herself wholly unobserved she only sell the readier into the snare which was laid for her at length her incessant and evident assiduities began to attract in return the attentions of leonardo now no longer diffident no longer retiring he sought not to repress the sensations she excited sensations not so ardent indeed because no longer new as those he had experienced for megalena but yet gradually acquiring strength and from the novelty of the object at least increasing in allurement his eyes and his language began to assure theresa that she had in some measure atchieved her anxiouslydesired object desirous if possible to rivet him at once her own she with eager and illconcealed delight appointed an evening when by a plan of her own suggestion he might unsuspected steal to her house the sentiments of leonardo though high and tremblingly alive to whatever regarded his pride or dignity of birth were not yet so punctilious as to shrink from the idea of infringing on the fidelity of love unused even from childhood to curb the slightest of his wishes and his selflove flattered by the early acquired regard of so young and lovely a female he hesitated not in accepting her invitation though his native delicacy taught him to consider it as somewhat premature but what then megalena herself had first inspired him with a taste for ignoble pleasures and it could scarcely be dishonorable to pursue with another the path her fascinations had pointed out the evening then was mutually agreed on and even the very hour fixed to this length did the secure and artful strozzi permit every thing to advance leonardo was suffered to make his escape to enter the house and even the apartment where his impatient fair one awaited to receive him but then so well so accurately had the florentine arranged her plan she burst upon them like a thundercloud for a few moments she even surveyed them but with that kind of horrible tranquillity that betokens an approaching storm theresa had greeted leonardo with a servent embrace and such was still their attitude with a look wherein was depicted the blackest rage the deepest vengeance and the bitterest scorn without advancing a step she continued to contemplate them then firmly and deliberately approaching leonardo she seized him by the arm so unimpaired was her power over his soul such was the awe almost the terror which he involuntarily felt while sinking abashed beneath the powerful glance of her eye that he had no power to resist the decisiveness of her action there was a something at this juncture in their relative situations that made her even in his own eyes appear the injured person and himself the worthless aggressor without a single rebellious struggle therefore on his side the florentine retained his arm which she grasped with the violence of smothered rage then casting on the trembling and foiled theresa a look which spoke volumes to her trembling soul she led with step haughty and indignant her recovered captive from the room returning homewards megalena preserved a gloomy silence leonardo essayed twice or thrice to speak but his tongue refused its office and accents half formed quivered on his lips shocked and repentant his mind suggested nothing that could allay the resentment he knew was boiling in the breast of his mistress at length they reached home and entered an apartment the florentine still preserving an uninterrupted silence threw herself upon a sopha and covering her face with her hands remained apparently absorbed in thought leonardo could bear no longer this terrible demeanor he became agonised the remembrance of the happiness he had till now enjoyed with his still adored megalena rushed impetuously over his ardent soul of theresa he knew little or nothing he felt an emotion bordering on rage and disgust rising in his bosom against her for having even momentarily alienated his thoughts from her to whom fondly he conceived that he owed so much no longer master of himself he rushed towards her he threw himself with violence at her feet kissed them and bedewed them with his tears this was only what the artful florentine had expected knowing well the haughtiness of his nature yet knowing likewise well the susceptibility of his feelings she had forborne to irritate by reproach him who was to be conquered by an appeal to the heart soh lovely oh adored megalena cried the repentant lover forgive forgive me i feel yes i feel that tis you alone i love pardon then in this conviction your unhappy guilty slave the florentine answered not what not a word not a word oh megalena resumed he almost distracted and snatching his stiletto forth i have lived too long then and thus let me force existence from my worthless though </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> though agonised heart as he spoke he tore open his vest and franticly made an attempt to plunge it in his bosom megalena starting up wrenched it from his furious grasp and threw it far still the devoted youth remained at her feet she cast her eyes downwards upon his graceful form and tenfold love assailed her softened soul she stretched forth her hand and bade him rise her voice reanimated him and springing up he folded her with ardor to his breast the artful strozzi returned his embrace but suddenly pushing him from her she exclaimed go bring me that stiletto he felt surprise but obeyed her imperious command she took it hastily from his hand then said in a solemn serious voice leonardo do you love me love you he eagerly repeated then mark me she resumed by this stiletto and by your hand theresa dies the youth shuddered and recoiled a few steps for human nature shrinks instinctively at murder hah false wretch do you hesitate fiercely exclaimed the florentine go then go to your theresa and quit my fight for ever hand will nothing less then appease thee oh megalena faltered out the enslaved leonardo tis plain he loves her gloomily muttered the vindictive strozzi soh no by heaven i do not eagerly replied leonardo prove it then by plunging this stiletto in her heart nought else can or shall convince me that you do not soh megalena my first my only mistress you will not you cannot surely require proof so dreadfuland imploringly he looked in her countenance that fierce countenance still retained its unchanging expressionin it he read consent or leave methis dreadful fiat made her appear from the apprehension it excited of losing her more beautiful then ever in his eyes her symmetrical form shone forth with redoubled loveliness to his heated fancy and while he gazed his struggles died away or were displaced by sensations which overpowered themhe stretched forth his burning hand it trembled with the consciousness of intended murder and in a faint faltering voice he said give me the dagger you consent then said the seductress megalena sto let it shed the blood of the insolent venetian i doi do hand to bring it me again stained and dripping with her gore allallyou require groaned the miserable leonardo i love youcruel megalenaoh how muchwhen to prove it i would murder the florentine cast the stiletto with violence away and opened her fair arms wide the bewildered leonardo rushed into their embrace and sunk overpowered on her bosom i forgive thee she cried i now forgive thee leonardo i wanted after thy cruel dereliction from me some proof that i was still lovedthat proof i have obtained and thou art mine again soh i was thine ever replied the infatuated youth tears gushing from his eyes i now believe that thou wert answered the florentine gazing exultingly upon her victim and then gently seating him beside her with a smile such was the fatal empire that a worthless wanton had acquired over a young and susceptible heart left to its wild energies ere reason could preponderate and thus darkly coloured became the future character of one yielding progressively to the most horrible crimes which if differently directed in early youth might have become an honor and an ornament to human nature megalena strozzi from this instance of the envy and treachery of female acquaintance became disgusted with venice and resolved to retire again to her villa near the banks of the lake that she might retain her captive in solitary safety having but rarely quitted her house during her stay at venice and even then avoiding the most public resorts she had as she desired escaped the observation of count berenza who indeed had he chanced to have espied her would have been more anxious to shun than recognise her venice however she with leonardo hastily quitted and repaired to aqua dolce secretly happy that she had borne away her lover from all further temptation and exclusively appropriated him to herself for a time she remained tranquil and satisfied she found means to diversify the scene and amuse the youthful taste of leonardo by rambling about the beautiful walks that environed her dwelling or sometimes in her gondola taking the fresco upon the lake yet spite of all this spite of being unceasingly in the society of him she preferred her restless spirit could not be restrained and again she panted for the gay pleasures of the city ennui began to take possession of her illorganized and resourceless mind for it is the pure intellectual soul alone that can receive delight from solitude venice with all its dangers became preferable in her eye to the gloomy sameness though security of the country and after a residence of a few weeks there she again resolved to brave the allurements of the city leonardo was equally desirous with herself to emerge from seclusion but having now acquired artifice he affected indifference to the proposed change megalena pleased at this appearance and flattering herself that he was now too firmly riveted to allow himself to be again seduced by the charms or incitements of others with as great eagerness as she had flown to it now hastened from her weary solitude arrived once more in venice she boldly resolved that she would no more as formerly debar herself from going as she had been wont to do to the most public resort of the gay venetians and she even decided in her mind that should berenza as fully she expected he would question her with respect to the nature of her intimacy with the youth leonardo to impose upon him if possible the same story that she had attempted to pass upon others in consequence of these arrangements it was that she no longer withheld herself </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> herself from figuring in st marks place and on the laguna leonardo however constantly declined accompanying her in these public exhibitions and the artful florentine procured him such amusements at home as should inform her on her return how he had employed his time thus it was that on a certain evening during one of her excursions on the lake she encountered berenza whom so long she had feared to meet but encountered him under circumstances that she had little expected bitter and offensive to her jealous soul was the situation in which she beheld him with a young and lovely rival seated by his side in gay and amorous converse with a basilisks eye she gazed upon her breathing destruction and revenge hand is it for this then she exclaimed that i have till now so anxiously concealed myself well might the wretch be incurious respecting me well he might leave me unmolested by his visits but why ah little could i guess and dearly shall he pay for the shortlived raptures his inconstancy has procured him thus bursting with rage swore the vengeful megalena and rushing immediately as she entered her abode in the apartment where she had left leonardo employed in finishing a drawing she threw herself upon a chair beside him and exclaimed throw throw aside your pencil leonardo and seize your dagger for by heaven this night he dies what saidst thou megalena inquired the youth with evident surprise fixing his eyes upon her countenance who is it dies to night and what dost thou mean by the rage which flamed on her cheek and sparkled in her eye leonardo easily discerned that somewhat unusual had occurred taking her hand and tenderly kissing it he pursued tell me megalena what has befallen thee eyes he shallby all my hopes of salvation he shall die franticly cried the vindictive florentine hand thou leonardo yes thou shalt execute my vengeance on him murder againthe theme was still horrible to leonardo and again he shuddered and recoiled wilt thou not consent leonardo she said in a hollow voice fixing upon him her large and fiercely gleaming eyes but say who must die cried the youth hand what is the offence against thee the treacherous the ungrateful betrayer but you know him not leonardo yet mark me my resolution is taken and it devolves on you to execute it the time is at length come wherein you must prove the strength the devotedness of your attachment to me now then hear meil conte berenza is a noble venetian he was the betrayer the deceiver of my youth to him do i oweyes to him added the artful florentine that first my soul wandered from the paths of virtue that i am now unworthy hiding her countenance upon the bosom of her agitated lover sto become ever more than the mistress of my leonardo the heart of leonardo become infinitely affected megalena proceeded this day i encountered him on the laguna accompanied by a female he passed me by he uttered words the most gross the most insulting i regarded him with horror and surprise painted in my looks when fearful i suppose that the mere sight of me should contaminate the purity of his present love he rudely waved his hand with an air of scorn and indignation as if to say impure wretch how dearest thou appear to recognise me in the presence of a superior femaleleonardo she pursued furiously starting from her chair strung with new rage by the relation of the falsehoods she had invented leonardo shall i tamely submit to this canst thou submit to it this to thy mistresses is for that he diesthy love has ennobled me and i will not now suffer degradation tamely the high susceptible feelings of leonardo thus artfully played upon became enkindled he participated in her wellfeigned outraged delicacy so flattering to his own selflove but still the revenge was dreadful to his mind proportioned too far beyond the offence perceiving that though his cheek glowed with indignation and his eyes with ardent love that still he spoke not determined then to work him to the pitch she required she resumed soh leonardo if in love for thee i have outstepped the bounds of delicacy and decorum oh let me not therefore with faltering voice she pursued let me not be with impunity outraged or trampled on by others no no no cried the overpowered leonardo raising her in his arms no never sweet mistress of my soul while i have life he who offends thee dies thou art then thou art my own cried the delighted florentine that assurance reanimate my sinking soul secure now of my cherished revenge i will discuss with thee further the steps to be pursued come my beloved leonardo let us go to the supper room obedient to her will leonardo accompanied her seated now at supper with the machinating florentine she fearful that his enthusiastic ardour might relax pledged him repeatedly in goblets of the most potent wine taking sufficient care however to elude swallowing more herself than would permit her to preserve her empire over him as it fatally happened for leonardo megalena never appeared more beautiful to him than at those times when she was urging him to the commission of some horrible evil so that deeds however repugnant to his nature and the loss of her love boy in his deluded eyes no comparison megalena well aware of this by appearing in her conduct and by her language as though she considered herself to have received his promise of avenging her took from him in fact the power of refusing to do so how to acknowledge to her that his soul shuddering recoiled from the idea of murder he knew not from his knowledge of her disposition he shrunk at encountering </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> encountering her direful rage her bitter reproaches and resentful looks but more he shrunk even in thought from the possibility of her abandoning him and with a violent but expiring struggle he decided in his mind to acquiesce and give up every attempt to alter the current of events as the fumes of the wine mounted to his brain the reasoning of principle subsided and the delusions of fancy increased the florentine became every moment more beautiful in his sight and he began to think that in her cause crime itself must become a virtue she who as she had persuaded him seduced by her wild unconquerable love towards him to forego and cast aside every principle of delicacy she who had braved for him the scorn and contumely of the world who had even this day through him as he conceived endured gross insult no it was no longer the representations of his lovely mistress which aroused him but honor justice and gratitude so wild and erring in the increasing heat of intoxication reasoned and believed the deluded leonardo it was now him who led to and followed up the subject while the exulting megalena by a refinement of artifice added fuel to the fire she had excited without appearing to do so at length unable to contain the burning rage she inspired him with he started suddenly up and drinking down an overflowing goblet of lacrymal christi he prepared to rush from the house without even taking the necessary precaution of a cloak and a mask as enforced by megalena for a moment she succeeded in calming him but only to direct his furor to unerring and surer destruction covering his face with a mask she armed him with a stiletto which she took from her girdle and covered his figure with a cloak then straining him in her arms she cried success attend thee strung anew by her seductive embrace stiletto in hand he flew from the house to plunge the deadly weapon in the heart of a man who had never injured him whom even he did not know such is the influence to be obtained by female profligacy over the warm feelings of unaided youth directed by the subtle enchantress leonardo easily gained the palazzo of berenza as it had been a night of festivity he found an easy access to the house and unobserved into the chamber where he concealed himself behind a wide curtain that covered a window which as has been said opened into a balcony on hearing berenza and victoria enter he had stepped into it for greater security and perceived with no indifferent feeling that it would in case of necessity afford him an opportunity of escape there ina state of mind bewildered yet dreading to be reasonable he remained till occasion seemed favorable for the execution of his purpose the success it met with has been already related to a hand rendered unsteady by a confused consciousness of the meditated crime was added the intense and overpowering horror of at once recognising a sister and burying in the same moment as he believed his dagger in her heart wild and dismayed precipitately he had fled a murderer in thought at least if not in deed and sought in a state of mind inexpressible the vile strozzi who like sin sat expecting to hear tidings of death well exclaimed she starting from the restless couch where she had thrown herself as pale and disordered the unhappy leonardo rushed into the room his mask in his hand and his vest torn open to admit the air to his burning bosom well is it done eyes yes vengeance is executed upon one of your enemies he cried in hurried accents upon the false the infamous berenza i hope eagerly returned megalena approaching and gazing in his pallid face no no upon my sister gloomily answered leonardo your sister you rave young coward cried megalena shaking him by the arm i do noti have mortally wounded victoria di loredani my sister wounded her mortally in the arms of him for whom my dagger was intended thy sister thy sister in a voice of fiendlike exultation cried the infamous strozziyet secretly enraged that berenza had not perished and thrown by the furor of disappointment off her guard then megalena strozzi is not the only fallen female upon earth no longer need she bow her head with shame to the groundwork laurina mother to the heir of loredani and victoria his sister both high and noble ladies raise her to their level by sinking to hersoh this is a balm to my soul she continued clapping her hands with a wild laugh berenza proud and accomplished seducer the woman who loves thee may sacrifice to thee her innocence and her same but thou wilt never sacrifice to her thy liberty or grant her thy honorable lovethus continued the unfeeling florentine wreaking upon the wretched leonardo the avenging scorpions of her tongue for having failed in the precise purport of his dreadful mission this was the first time since their illadvised union that she had ventured to breathe aught concerning much less taunt him with the agonising secret of his family misfortunes his high soul sickened and shrunk within him at allusions so barbarous for an instant he regarded with horror the infamous strozzi he essayed to speak but could not and overpowered with violent and conflicting emotions he fell prostrate on the floor it was then megalena began to think and even admitted the conviction that she had proceeded too far she almost feared that by the inhuman stab she had given to the high feelings of the youth she had destroyed for ever in his heart every particle of love for herself this reflection served in an instant to change the tenor of her conduct from the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> the malice of rage and disappointment she softened to the suggestions of her interest which whispered to her that in losing now the regards and future devotement of leonardo upon which she calculated much she should lose her all throwing herself beside him therefore she passionately implored his forgiveness and sought by the repetition of every welltried artifice to soothe and alleviate the agonising tumult she had excited by degrees her blandishments began to prevail over the infatuated youth and even the horrible recollections she had awakened in his mind of his being in reality a disgraced and wandering outcast drew him but more closely to her who knowing him for what he was still loved and took an interest in his fate he adored her though she had wounded him to the soul and when to her caresses and ardent professions of eternal attachment she solicited some reply he raised her in his arms as kneeling she bent over him and pressing her with violent emotion to his bosom passionately cried megalena i am thine stillyes i feel that i am and shall be so for ever oh lovely and seducing woman eternal must thy empire be over me and if i forsake thee may the curse of heaven light upon my head then cried the florentine delighted at the strength and solemnity of this assurance let us from this moment be eternally devoted to each other let us swear that nor time accident nor circumstance shall ever disunite us i swear answered leonardo ardently i swear it again and kissed with rapture the extended hand of megalena receive too my oath of perpetual allegiance to thee loved youth with ardour exclaimed the florentine for i solemnly swear to be ever true and devoted to thee know then she added more calmly let all past differences be buried in oblivion and the more material circumstances of the moment obtain our consideration seating herself beside leonardo she then desired a minuter detail of the occurrences of the night when suddenly in the midst of his relation she missed the dagger which she had given to him her highflushed cheek became immediately blanched by terror and eagerly she interrupted him to ask him concerning it in an instant the recollection flashed upon his mind that in endeavouring to recover his mask he had never thought of retrieving his dagger likewise which he did not even remember to have drawn from the bosom of victoria where fully he believed himself to have plunged it such had been the horror and agitation of his mind he could retrace nothing distinctly yet the dagger unquestionably was left behind and this was enough to distract the florentine gasping for breath we are undone she cried we are betrayed for on the hilt of that dagger is engraved at full length the name of megalena strozzi leonardo was silent for he dreaded the reproaches which he almost felt he merited suddenly recovering however her presence of mind she exclaimed we must fly we must fly instantly the night is not yet spent before daybreak we may be far from this detested city to some future period must i defer the completion of my just revengeyou tremble young man but let us hope she added with a horrible smile that you will not always be thus dismayed at the thought of bloodwhy leonardo thou art not half a venetian nam i not megalena when occasion calls i can prove myself one but i feel that were i even abject by blood and in my heart that thou couldst render me equal to any thing still as he spoke his eyes refused to meet the shrinking gaze of the florentine we shall fly then together beloved leonardo said she hand i shall not so much regret our enforced departure from this gay city for now to be frank with thee my love my resources diminish daily this place affords me no longer the exhaustless mine i once imagined it would the venetians have become wary or can it be that i am changed from beauty to deformity be it as it may we will quit it reluctantly and let us hope that elsewhere better fortune may be ours though some parts of megalenas speech had surprised leonardo he forbore unwilling to diminish her fascinations in his own eyes to require more ample explanation he took her hand hastily and said i will follow thee fair megalena wheresoever thou wilt even unto the end of my life as we have mutually sworn smiles of pleasure chased from the brow of the florentine the gloomy traces of rage and unsatisfied revenge she looked upon her lover with eyes of gratitude and ardent affection he was indeed become her all her sole dependance in the plans of her future life for vicious profligate and unsteady though still not past the zenith of her charms they were deemed so far from counterbalancing the violent passions which deformed her mind that she had but few admirers among the jealous and suspicious venetians she now hastened from the room to make every preparation for an immediate flight in less then two hours she had gathered together all the valuables she possessed and which were capable of being taken with themevery requisite was arranged and the grey eye of the morning beheld them far from venice unhappy laurina whose criminal desertion of thine offspring entailed upon them such misery and degradation in this early career of their lives behold the guilt and unworthiness for which thou art amenable yet darker still and disfigured by greater crimes will be the days which are to come faultless example would have shamed into efforts of virtue the proud and violent nature of thy daughter yet behold her now without even a remorseful struggle abandoning its precepts thy sou the dark hue </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> hue of his character decided the slave of an artful worthless want on who presumes and justly presumes to call herself thy equal while through a terrible and unforeseen combination of events he has been on the eve of becoming the murderer of his sistertremble unfortunate and guilty mother for longer and more gloomy becomes the register of thy crimes the letter which was written by megalena strozzi and which from an obscure spot in the island of capri she had caused to be conveyed to berenza has been already given at full in a preceding part of this history and was received as stated about a fortnight after the mutual flight of leonardo and herself well knowing that pursuit must then be vain and from the precautions they had taken to trace their route impossible still undetermined where eventually to six but resolving to be guided by circumstances respecting their future plans we must now for a considerable length of time leave them and return to the thread of our narrative youth and that strength of mind which precluded hypochondriac malady did not permit victoria to languish long under the effects of her wound she grew rapidly convalescent but during her inevitable confinement external objects not intervening much to distract her regards by flattering her vanity she had full leisure to concentrate her great and varied powers into one pointthat of rendering herself an object of such moment to her lover that he should consider with horror the bare possibility of losing her and be anxious to bind her more completely his by ties esteemed indissoluble but such had already been the effect produced upon berenza by conduct which he could not help considering proof of the most heroic love as well as courage that he no longer viewed her with tender passion only but with the strongest sentiments of gratitude and enthusiastic admiration what could woman more than voluntarily nay eagerly oppose her own life in defence of his who but victoria could possess at once such tender and such exalted sentiments towards a lover longer to doubt the truth the romantic ardour of her attachment would he esteemed be sacrilege his ideas underwent a wonderful but natural revolutions more the haughty berenza proud of his noble his unsullied blood fearing to dash it with a tincture of disgraceno more looking down with protecting air a high and superior being upon a mistress beloved indeed but not considered as an equal because though innocent in reality in his eyes she was a scion of infamy and shameno his heart now throbbed with excessive tenderness and now ached with compunctious pangs that he could ever have deemed unworthy of his honorable love the creature before him shining superior in a glory emanating from herself the creature to whom he now thought himself inferior so complete and powerful a dominion had the act of victoria obtained over his mind that his proud and dignified attachment softened into a doating and idolatrous love he was no longer the refined the calculating philosopher but the yielding devoted lover devoted to the excess of his passion in short he felt that now to be happy to conciliate his conscience and to atone to victoria for his past injustice he must make her his wife no sooner had he formed this resolution than he believed himself to have discovered a balm for every thing and to experience a pure sensation of delight till now unknown unable long to contend against the strong impulse of his heart he waited only for the reestablishment of victorias health to pour out his feelings at her feet and to offer to her the unworthy gift of himself when therefore he thought her sufficiently recovered to permit him to touch upon a subject that must as he supposed occasion some emotion he no longer withheld himself from giving utterance to what had of late so often risen from an overflowing heart to his lips victoria heard him with a look of complacency and all that softness she knew so well how to assume but pride having always kept her from surmising the struggles of berenza upon her subject and that he had not till this period offered to become her husband because till this period he had deemed her unworthy to become his wise having never surmised this she betrayed no immediate emotion or unspeakable delight no overpowering transport or surprise but listened to him in silence with an acquiescent smile this being considered by berenza as a coolness of demeanor uncongenial to the subject he mentally attributed it to wounded pride in victoria that he had not sooner made her an offer of his hand his own noble delicacy caught the alarm and his liberal soul acknowledged the justice of her feeling anxious then to remove from her mind every uneasy impression the ardour of his manner increased and he prayed of victoria to pardon the unworthiness of his past scruples here berenza erred had he flopped at the simple intention of offering his hand to victoria he had done right but his last insinuation though broken and obscure darted like lightning through her brain and struck to her proud heart as a threeedged dagger that proud heart had now indeed taken an alarm far beyond any that berenzas imagination could have conceived her brow lowered she turned of an ashy paleness as sudden hatred and desire of revenge took possession of her vindictive soul the conviction flashed upon her that she had till this moment been deemed by berenza unworthy of becoming his wife the secret then is betrayed thought she the sort of union into which he entered with me and which vainly i preferred as a proof of his love for me was desired by him only as being least offensive to his dignity and pridetis well rapidly </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> rapidly these ideas passed through the mind of victoria and while secretly vowing the offence should never be forgotten she again harmonised her features and clothed them with smiles since such had been the sentiments of berenza it now became unquestionably a desirable point to become at once his wife to have triumphed by any means over his stern and detested pride was something but it could not obliterate the crime of having ever dared to view her in an inferior light unhappy berenza all thy delicacy thy forbearance and nobleness of mind will not save thee from the consequences of having proceeded thus far the changes of victorias countenance were only attributed by her lover to an unconquerable emotion which she struggled to conceal at this undeniable proof of the strength of his attachment to her delicately solicitous to raise her in her own eyes he with pressing earnestness entreated of her a prompt compliance to their union victoria fixed upon him her eyes pregnant with an unusual expression for busy were her evil thoughts against him why is that look my love inquired berenza i look upon thee as i love thee answered victoria hand thou wilt be minehonorably and solemnly mine then said berenza with eagerness i will answered victorian most ardently desire to become thy wife berenza who understood nothing by these expressions but simply what met the ear viewed her with an increase of tenderness and admiration for it is a principle in human nature to exalt in our minds those objects we are determined to favor and elevate a very short period from this beheld victoria di loredani the wife of il conte berenza and becoming so her faults in the eyes of an admiring husband were wholly obliterated and her better qualities appeared to shine forth with redoubled effect with what a different and far more refined feeling did he now walk with her in st marks place or exhibit her on the laguna amid thousands of gay venetians in their gondolas with what pleasure with what delight with an air how unembarrassed did he now introduce as his wise to an elegant and respectable society her whom he could have felt buta vain and inconsiderable triumph in introducing as his mistress to the gay and dissolute in having made his victoria an honorable wife he experienced a noble and benevolent satisfaction which had for its basis the reflection of having raised to a level with the higher class of society her whom he might have been instrumental in sinking to that of the lowest but though the conduct of the refined berenza was such as to claim and to deserve the highest gratitude and love the vindictive spirit of victoria could not forget that he had once deemed her unworthy of ranking on an equality with himself for this in her moments of solitude her heart swelled with unforgiving hate she despised and undervalued the advantages she possessed and fed the discontented repining of her mind by recalling to memory the moment when he unfortunately betrayed the state of his sentiments respecting her sometimes she even regretted that under circumstances so humiliating she had consented to become his wife and almost determined to shew her contempt of his fancied condescension by abandoning him if at these times her unconscious husband by chance obtruded he was received with a gloomy and discontented air which when he pressed her to explain she attributed either to indisposition or an involuntary depression of spirits when the mind is dissatisfied whether upon grounds just or unjust it ever views objects through an exaggerated medium trifles which when in a sane state would have passed unnoticed are twisted from their proper insignificance to aid the conceptions of a disturbed imagination thus was it with victoria she knew and felt that berenza was her superior and she imagined that he must feel it likewise every word every look every action she thought reproached her with her former degradation and the abjectness from which it had pleased him to raise her her fits of gloom and abstraction increased she forbore to cultivate any society from a sentiment of most unpardonable pridepride which like a worm in the heart the more it was cherished the more corroded and the luckless berenza was sometimes in the momentary sting of disappointed hope compelled to acknowledge that though the situation of a wife might have rendered more respectable the object of his love it had for ever destroyed the charms and fascinations of the mistress yet still he loved her with the tenderest the truest affection five years had now rolled on since a union but little productive of real happiness to either party when one evening a violent ringing at the gate of the palazzo bespoke the approach of an impatient visitor soon a stranger was announced and almost in the same moment entered the saloon berenza rose from his chair but scarcely did he cast a glance towards him ere he flew into the arms that opened to receive him exclaiming welcome to venice welcome home my beloved henriquez then turning towards victoria as surprise and delight permitted him to recover himself behold a beloved brother my victoria he said hand you my brother behold an adored wife now now indeed may i expect to be truly happy henriquez pressed the hand of his brother and paid some graceful compliments to victoria who gazing upon him with admiration in an instant drew ungrateful comparisons between their persons to the disadvantage of him in whom her soul should have discerned no fault but that benevolent and unsuspicious being seated himself between them and felt as he deserved to be truly happy hitherto it has not been thought requisite to enlarge materially upon the cause that induced the departure and stay of berenzas brother from venice it </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> it has been hinted however that it was to divert if possible by activity and change of scene the ardour and impetuosity of a passion that he had conceived for a young lady whose father had on the plea of their mutual youth opposed their union but who in reality was desirous only of obtaining a higher match for the blooming lilla his daughter at that period little more than thirteen years of age for although he could not bestow upon her the smallest dowry he conceived that the nobility of her birth entitled her to the first duck in venice the circumstance of his having lately become deceased which event lilla in corresponding with had imparted to her lover was the means of bringing him thus in anxious eagerness to venice fondly hoping that now every obstacle to their union was removed which still remained the first fond wish of his bosom undiminished by time or an absence of years for where as with impassioned earnestness he demanded of himself could he ever hope to find in another that purity and innocence which his heart told him still dwelt incorruptible in the bosom of his young and lovely mistress berenza to whom during supper he related the delightful cause of his sudden return and dwelt with all the ardour of a lover upon the fond hope he entertained of being soon enabled to call lilla his fondly took pleasure in flattering him that nothing indeed was now likely to disappoint the desires of his heart victoria listened in silence to the conversation and an indefinite sentiment resembling regret glanced through her bosom when she thereby discovered that the affections of the young henriquez were so deeply engaged at length they separated for the night the lover to dream of the fair creature that in the morning he hoped to embrace and the disturbed victoria to arrange if possible the confusion of idea that floated in her mind scarcely had the first beams of morning enlightened the east ere henriquez awaked ardent and impatient to visit the object of his love soon as propriety might in the least admit he flew to her residence the fair lilla received him indeed with all the warmth with all the affection he could have wished but his buoyant hopes were quelled by what she said in reply to his eager solicitations to become immediately his her father was indeed dead but still impediments existed she was under the protection of an ancient female relative who with herself had remained with him in his last moments it was the dying request nay command of that father cruel and relentless even in death that she should not marry till the expiration of a whole year from the time that he should be consigned to the earth to this she had solemnly and implicitly promised obedience and to this requisition hard as it was she professed to henriquez her fixed resolution to adhere educated in sentiments of the severest piety it was in her idea a sacred and religious obligation in her to fulfil a promise to the dying nay she would have deemed it horrible sacrilege even to hesitate or waver respecting its performance and all the entreaties of her lover to make her forego adherence to what he considered an arbitrary and most unjust command were not only vain but tended almost to shake him in her long and deeprooted sentiments of esteem by giving her doubts of his moral character little more than one month had as yet elapsed since the interment of the tyrannical parent nearly a whole year even now must roll over their heads ere they could become united yet even against this grievous representation on the side of henriquez the pious lilla was proof and with a heart nearly as agonised as if he had been compelled to resign for ever his hopes the unhappy lover returned to his brothers palazzo his first impulse was to seek him in private and relate to him the disappointment of his wishes with lilla the kind berenza listened with attentive sympathy and it occurred to him that since lilla would not immediately become the wife of henriquez the pains of delay might be infinitely alleviated by prevailing on her to become a constant visitor at the palazzo which as berenza was now married and she herself under the protection of a female relative who would always accompany her could not certainly be in the least an objectionable alternative this was indeed pouring balm into the wounds of henriquez scarcely would the eager and impassioned youth permit his brother to conclude ere he rushed from his presence and appeared again before his beloved lilla to impart to her the proposition of berenza and to implore her to accede to it this the scrupulous and innocent girl offered no objection to and the heart of her lover was once more rendered comparatively light on the evening of the same day she consented accompanied by her relation to visit victoria for it was under that shape alone that henriquez had ventured to propose her seeing him at the palazzo of his brother he then once more departed and related to berenza his second attempt with the success it had met upon the conscientiousness and delicacy of his mistress in the evening according to promise the fair girl made her appearance and was by henriquez introduced to the conte and to victoria as his destined wife but never ah surely never was unconscious guest received with feelings and with thoughts so hostile as was the innocent lilla by victoria yet still the smile played upon the disciplined features of the accomplished hypocrite and the hand was extended to hid her welcome throughout the evening her conduct was such as to excite a timid gratitude and respect in the breast </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> breast of her lovely visitor and to make her appear admirable in the eyes of the delighted henriquez why were unreal appearances that shed around such pure expansive satisfaction dark and dreadful are the intricacies of the human heart when debased as was victorias almost unknowing to herself she conceived immediate hatred for the orphan lilla because she was dear because she was beloved by henriquez and henriquez had appeared charming in her eyes it was the early influence of this newborn sentiment that had generated one so base and victorias was not a noble and an honorable mind that would combat in itself feelings that were improper to be indulged rather would she have sought their gratification unmindful of the misery that might be produced to others as though the curse of laurina were entailed upon her daughter that of becoming absorbed by a guilty and devouring flame with the single exception that in the case of the former the heart and mind had been involuntarily seduced by a designing betrayer while the other cherished and encouraged an increasing passion for one who attempted her not and which common honor should have taught her to repel victoria dwelt with unrestrained delight upon the attractions of the object that had presented itself to her fickle and illregulated mind from her infancy untaught therefore unaccustomed to subdue herself she had no conception of that refined species of virtue which consists in selfdenial the proud triumph of mind over the weakness of the heart she had ever been unconscious of education had never corrected the evil propensities that were by nature hers hence pride stubbornness the gratification of self contempt and ignorance of the nobler properties of the mind with a strong tincture of the darker passions revenge hate and cruelty made up the sum of her early character example a mothers example had more than corroborated every tendency to evil and the unhappy victoria was destitute of a single actuating principle that might inconsideration of its guilt deter her from the pursuit of a favorite object her mind alas was an eternal night which the broad beam of virtue never illumined henriquez was the subject of her thoughts by day he employed her fancy by night his form presented itself if she awoke he figured in her dreams if she slumbered daily nay momentarily her unchecked passion acquired strength already she viewed with disgust heightened by unfading remembrance of the sentiments he had once entertained respecting her the being who had claims so strong upon her gratitude and affection for the young lilla she cherished the most unprovoked and the bitterest hate the hot breath she respired was charged with wishes for her destruction yet each and all of these beings were unconscious of the feelings they inspired for the honorable berenza whose mild philosophy taught him it was only just to conclude that love induced love and proofs of esteem gratitude regarded his wife with an unvarying tenderness the innocent lilla placed confidence in her smiles and courteous demeanor while henriquez absorbed in the contemplation of an adored mistress remarked not the impassioned glances of another directed towards him nor the pointed attentions by which they were at times accompanied eminently indeed calculated to excite an ardent love in youth was the mind and person of the orphan lilla pure innocent tree even from the smallest taint of a corrupt thought was her mind delicate symmetrical and of fairylike beauty her person so small yet of so just proportion sweet expressing a seraphic serenity of soul seemed her angelic countenance slightly suffused with the palest hue of the virgin rose long flaxen hair floated over her shoulders she might have personified were the idea allowable innocence in the days of her childhood her very situation had a powerful claim upon the heart of sensibility for the blooming lilla was an orphan no ostensible protector had she under the face of heaven since an old and feeble relative whose very existence from day to day appeared precarious could not justly be deemed so this very circumstance it was that drew most powerfully towards her the benevolent soul of berenza and ardently he longed for the expiration of the allotted year that she might obtain in the arms of his brother a safe and honorable refuge time rolled on and the effervescence of victorias mind increased almost to madness nothing but the consideration of the proposed marriage between henriquez and lilla being in conformance with the religious scruples of the latter protracted kept her within the bounds of discretion necessary even for the accomplishment of her own purpose but as she beheld time passing away and that still henriquez the idol of her thoughts remained wholly insensible to the most open insinuations almost avowals of the feelings he had excited she became nearly frantic with desperation and resolved to risk every thing to obtain her point the most wild and horrible ideas took possession of her brain crimes of the deepest dye her imagination could conceive appeared as nothing opposed to the possibility of obtaining a return of love from henriquez to see him and to see him bestowing upon the envied lilla marks of the tenderest attachment made her wild with the furor of conflicting passions now it was that she truly felt she had never loved the injured berenza but that circumstances the situation of the moment and a combination of events alone had first induced her to attend and ultimately to fly to him as the only being who would afford her protection she now viewed him asa philosophic sensualist alone whose conduct towards her had been solely actuated by selfish motives was he not considerably her superior in years it was plain then that his regard for her had been of the most unworthy kind and his anxiety to ascertain her </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> her love for him ere he took advantage of the situation into which she had thrown herself a refinement of the grossest artifice but henriquez the lovely henriquez was more upon an equality with her and it was for him that the selfish berenza should have reserved her thus it was that she ungratefully reflected upon the delicate and noble conduct of the conte towards her forgotten all his honorable forbearance despised his refined and disinterested attachment and thus it is that in the pursuance of some favorite object the wicked depreciate the benefits they have received retiring one night to her chamber more gloomy more repining than ever she threw herself upon her bed secretly wishing that berenza that lilla nay even the whole world if it stood between her and the attainment of her object could become instantly annihilated her bosom ached with the exhausting conflict of the most violent passions death and destruction entered her thoughts and twice she started up as impelled to execute some dreadful purpose she knew not what horrible images possessed her brain and her heart seemed burning with an intense and unquenchable fire she became even herself astonished at the violence of the sensations which shook her and for an instant believed herself under the influence of some super and unknown power transported nearly beyond the bounds of reason almost expecting in the wildness of her distempered fancy to behold somewhat that should corroborate her idea perhaps even to soothe the agony of her bosom she started up again from her thornstrewed pillow but no all was peaceful withoutthe rage and the confusion was in her breast a dim light at the further end of the chamber emitting a few solitary rays revealed the surrounding loneliness and gloom she pressed her hand on her throbbing temples her heart beat with violence and once more overpowered she laid her head upon her pillow at length she fell into a disturbed slumber dreams of mysterious tendency began to slit in the disordered eye of sleep first she beheld in a beautiful and luxurious garden lilla and henriquez his arm encircled her waist and her head reclined upon his shoulder while he contemplated her angelic countenance with looks of ineffable love at this vision a deep groan broke in sleep from the miserable victoria she endeavoured to turn her eyes from them but could not and while the most horrible and raging pains shot through her heart they suddenly disappeared from before her and she found herself alone in a remote part of the garden presently she beheld approaching towards her a group of shadowy figures they appeared to hover in mid air but at no great distance from the earth and as they came nearer she discerned that though of a deadly paleness their features were beautiful and serene these passed gradually when as if from the midst of them she beheld advancing a moor of a noble and majestic form he was clad in a habit of white and gold on his head he wore a white turban which sparkled with emeralds and was surmounted by a waving feather of green his arms and legs which were bare were encircled with the finest oriental pearl he wore a collar of gold round his throat and his ears were decorated with gold rings of an enormous size victoria contemplated this figure with an inexplicable awe and as she gazed he bent his knee and extended his arms towards her while in this attitude her mind filled with terror she looked upon him with dread and essaying to fly she stumbled and awoke reflecting on her dream she could attribute it only to the disturbed state of her mind and desirous if possible to forget for a few moments her pain she again endeavoured to sleep scarcely had thought become again suspended ere fancy took the lead she now saw herself in a church brilliantly illuminated when horrible to her eyes approaching the altar near which she stood appeared lilla led by henriquez and attired as a bride in the instant that their hands were about to be joined the moor she had beheld in her preceding dream appeared to start between them and beckoned her towards him involuntarily she drew near him and touched his hand when berenza stood at her side and seizing her arm endeavoured to pull her away wilt thou be mine in a hurried voice whispered the moor in her ear hand none then shall oppose thee but victoria hesitated and cast her eyes upon henriquez the moor stepped back and again the hand of henriquez became joined with lillas wilt thou be mine exclaimed the moor in a loud voice hand the marriage shall not be soh yes yes eagerly cried victoria overcome by intense horror at the thoughts of their unionin an instant she occupied the place of lilla and lilla no longer the blooming maid but a pallid spectre fled shrieking through the aisles of the church while berenza suddenly wounded by an invisible hand sunk covered with blood at the foot of the altar exultation filled the bosom of victoria she attempted to take the hand of henriquez but casting her eyes upon him she beheld him changed to a frightful skeleton and in terror awoke her mind was now in a chaos of agitation and horror from which she found it difficult to recover endeavouring however by a violent effort to recall her scattered ideas and to resume her usual firmness she became collected enough to review the leading features of her dream the image which upon this review presented itself most forcibly to her mental vision was that of the moor whose person she had a confused idea of having seen frequently before after a minutes reflection she identified him for zofloya the servant of henriquez why </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> why he should be connected with her dreams who never entered her mind when waking she could not divine but certain it was that his exact resemblance though as it were of polished and superior appearance had figured chiefly in her troubled sight she next reverted to the terrible moment in which she beheld joined the hands of lilla and henriquez but that zofloya had offered to prevent the marriage on this incident she pondered with a sensation of pleasure and berenza bleeding and dying at her feet she contemplated as a blissful omen of her success the more she considered the more she inferred the less reason she perceived for interpreting ill the visions of the night and the conclusion which at length she drew was this that every barrier to the gratification of her wishes would ultimately be destroyed and that she should at length obtain henriquez all else she considered as prevalent to the true purport of her dream and the fantastic ebullitions of a disturbed mind the frequent introduction of zofloya she judged to be merely in consequence of her beholding him daily sometimes attending behind the chair of his master at mealtimes and on other occasions while henriquez changing to a skeleton when she obtained his hand was emblematic only she conceived that he would be hers till death the following day when at a late hour she entered the apartment where they usually dined the first object that caught her attention was the tall commanding figure of the moor standing near the chair of his master she almost started as she beheld him and the image in her dreams flashing upon her mind she marked how exact was the similitude inform in features and in dress she seated herself however at the table but involuntarily stole frequent glances towards him once or twice she imagined that he looked upon her with a peculiar expression of countenance and strange incongruous ideas shot through her brain ideas which even to herself were indefinable she became at length gloomy and abstracted from mere incapacity to develop her own sensations but to be gloomy and abstracted had of late ceased in her to become remarkable and while the excellent berenza in secret deplored this change in his beloved victoria he forbore the slightest reproach endeavouring only by the kindest and most delicate attentions to disperse her frequent melancholy the innocent lilla too with gentle sweetness would sometimes approach and seek by endearment or lively converse to remove what was so evident to all but the efforts of the lovely girl appeared rather to injure than to benefit victoria they roused her from her dejection indeed but excited strong irritability and feelings of the bitterest nature solitude in general seemed to delight her most and as she had denied to berenza that she possessed any definable cause of melancholy in that he permitted her to indulge hoping unsuspicious of the evil in her heart that her mind by its own efforts would recover its tone as for henriquez though he treated her with friendship and respect as the wife of his brother he did no more first because he was absorbed in lilla and secondly because being so completely both in mind and person the reverse of that pure and delicate being he not only failed to view them as two creatures of the same class but almost thought of victoria with a tincture of dislike from the very circumstance of her being so opposite to his lovely mistress the moor zofloya was beloved by all save one in the palazzo of berenza this single exception of the general sentiment was discernible in a man called latona a domestic who had resided for some years in the service of the conte envy and hatred filled his heart in contemplating the superior qualities of zofloya whose elegant person was his least recommendation he could dance with inimitable grace and his skill in music was such that in excursions on the laguna he frequently at the request of his master occupied one end of the gondola to charm the company with the exquisiteness of his harmony these rare distinctions and the estimation in which the moor was held by his superiors so preyed upon the mind of latoni that he abhorred to look upon him and sought every occasion to irritate him that in some quarrel or sight he might do him a mortal injury the moor however disdaining latoni treated him with sovereign contempt and no bitterness of language could extort from him other reply than a smile of most expressive scorn this behaviour would enrage latoni to a pitch of madness but not daring to wreak his vengeance upon so universal a favorite he had no alternative but to rush from the spot and vent in curses the malignant fury of his breast it happened that some few days after the singular dreams of victoria while their impression and their tendency still occupied her mind that the moor zofloya became suddenly missing as he was so highly prized by henriquez and admired by all this circumstance caused infinite consternation throughout the palazzo and none indeed did it affect more strongly most inconceivably to herself than victoria every place that he had ever been in the habit of frequenting where even there was the remotest probability of his having been was scrupulously sought and referred to people were sent different ways throughout venice to gain if possible some intelligence respecting him but all in vain several days elapsed and not the smallest tidings could be obtained conjecture at length became weary and hope began to sail all further attempts to learn the fate of zofloya were considered to be vain and time alone was expected to developed the mysterious circumstances of his sudden disappearance in the midst of this the domestic latoni was </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> was seized with sickness and confined to his bed berenza who regarded him as an old and faithful servant used every endeavour to promote his recovery but his disorder rapidly gaining ground the physicians confessed the inability of medicine to save him from approaching death this final opinion being conveyed to latoni he was seized with the most terrible pangs from which he only recovered to entreat the presence of a confessor his master and signor henriquez ere he resigned his breath this request of a dying man the benevolent berenza readily complied with henriquez likewise consented to accompany him and victoria she knew not why begged permission to be present all together then entered the chamber of the expiring latoni who soon as he beheld them raising himself in his bed spoke as follows my lord berenza and you signor henriquez execrate not a dying penitent but listen with mercy and forgiveness to his confession it is i latoni who know all concerning the disappearance of the moor zofloya i envied his beauty his accomplishments and hated him for the admiration which they obtained him i fought many opportunities of provoking him to quarrel with me but he treated me with contempt and this increasing my rage against him determined me to take his life wretch exclaimed victoria signora peace i beseech you for i must be brief and the pangs i now endure may almost expiate my crime none evening the evening he was missing followed him from the palazzo i watched his footsteps but kept at a distance i observed him on st marks my heart panted with uncontrollable fury and desire of vengeance for the bitter moments he had given mei saw him raise his eyes to heaven and contemplate the spangled skyhe stood almost close to the brink over the canal and i longed to push him in headlong but the idea that this might not effect completely his destruction and that he might save himself by expert swimming stayed my eager hand and softly i approached him from behindhe heard me noti took trembling with fear of failure my dagger from my belt and plunged it repeatedly into his back ere he could even attempt to defend himself i then satisfied that he must perish tumbled him into the water from which he never rose and hastily fled the spotan avenging conscience pursued me however and prevented me from enjoying the fruits of my crime death approaches and the torments of hell are open to my view as latoni concluded strong convulsions seized him and he fell back upon his pillow his confession had eased his conscience but could not prolong his life he lingered a few hours then praying for mercy though almost despairing to obtain it he breathed his last great was the grief of victoria on hearing thus circumstantially detailed the loss and destruction of one who had began so deeply to interest her thoughts she found it impossible to account for the degree of feeling which affected her she had never been conscious of the slightest prediction in favor of the moor and till the circumstance of his impressing her mind from appearing in her dreams had never even cast a thought more than common upon him from that period indeed she had been most inexplicably interested about him nor could she for any length of time banish his idea from her mind it was vain therefore that she essayed to feel indifferent to the reflection of his unhappy fate she found it impossible and experienced a weight at her heart as if under the impression of having sustained a heavy loss zofloya though a moor and by a combination of events and the chance of war in the final victory of the spaniards over the moors of granada reduced to a menial situation was yet of noble birth of the race of the abdoulrahmans he had after severe vicissitudes when still young fallen into the hands of a spanish nobleman who pitying his misfortunes considered him rather as a friend than an inferior and bestowed high polish upon the education he had received henriquez having become acquainted with this nobleman during his travels to divert the sorrows of his love he formed with him a strict friendship founded in some degree upon similarity of situation as well as sentiment unfortunately however in the height of their friendship the spaniard became involved in a quarrel which terminated in bloodshed he received a wound which was pronounced to be mortal and henriquez had the melancholy office of attending a friend in his dying moments at this awful period it was that he among other changes recommended to his future protection the moor zofloya henriquez promised implicit observance to all his wishes and zofloya was in consequence taken immediately after the death of his first master and protector into the service and guardianship of henriquez these peculiar circumstances besides his excellent and ingenuous nature considerably endeared the moor to him and he loved him not only for the sake of his departed friend but for his intrinsic worth as well his loss therefore by henriquez was most sensibly and deeply regretted and the confirmation of his frightful death received with sentiments of acute grief nine days had now elapsed since the death of latoni nothing had as yet been heard to contradict his dying account of the end of zofloya when to the surprise of every one on the evening of the tenth he entered the apartment where the family of berenza were assembled all started from their seats and victoria overcome with mixed emotions sunk into hers again an explanation of his astonishing and unlooked for return was hastily demanded by his master when gracefully bowing the moor gave of himself the following account nos the cause of latonis hatred towards me i am </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> am wholly unconscious he frequently sought my life and on the night that he followed me with murderous intent and wounded me repeatedly with his stiletto i discerned whose hand aimed the blows but was not empowered to make effectual resistance being as it happened wholly unarmed i struggled with the base assassin however but not aware of his intentions he pushed me faint as i was with loss of blood over the edge of the steps on which i was standing when he first attacked me into the canal below here undoubtedly i must have perished but that an honest fisherman returning to padua was the means of my preservation by extricating me from the water assisted by the feeble struggles for life that i was yet enabled to make fortunately none of my wounds proved to be serious and being in possession of a secret transmitted to me by my ancestors for speedily healing even the most dangerous ones i remained at the hut of the fisherman till i was perfectly recovered and enabled once more to present myself before the honorable family to whom i owe my highest gratitude and respect here ended the narration of zofloya who when he had received the congratulations of every one upon his miraculous escape form destruction appeared to learn with evident surprise the death of latoni he demonstrated however visible joy at the intelligence and returning thanks submissive yet dignified for the kindness manifested towards him respectfully withdrew from the apartment casting as he went a look of the most animated gratitude upon victoria as though his heart thanked her for the interest she had appeared to take in his story beyond what his respect would permit him to express as for victoria in proportion as she had been miserable at the disappearance of the moor in so much was she rejoiced to behold him again her heart dilated with an unaccountable delight with which the image of henriquez was deeply connected for she thought of him with less of jealous agony and more of confidence and hope as though strange as it appeared the mere presence of zofloya possessed a secret charm to facilitate her wishes this idea gave an animation to her countenance and a slow to her spirits that for some time had not been perceptible in her the change delighted the unsuspicious berenza who flattered himself that it was the dawning triumph of vigorous reason over the morbid refinements of a sickly fancy the innocent lilla too caressed her with heartfelt pleasure and victoria returned her caresses with a gloomy eagerness as the murderer might be tempted to fondle the beauty of the babe whose life he intended to take henriquez always participating in the pleasures and sorrows of his mistress paid too a more than usual attention to victoria but it was an attention in compliment to lilla to a brother whom he loved and not the spontaneous effusions of his heart to her on this night victoria retired to bed with feelings of delight that teemed with woe to others hers was not that innocent vivacity which springs at once from the purity and sanity of the heart it was the wild and frightful mirth of a tyrant who condemns his subjects to the torture that he may laugh at their agonies it was the brilliant glare of the terrible volcano pregnant even in its beauty with destruction scarcely had her head reclined upon her pillow ere the image of zofloya swam in her sight she slumbered and he haunted her dreams sometimes she wandered with him over beds of flowers sometimes over craggy rocks sometimes in fields of the brightest verdure sometimes over burning sands tottering on the ridge of some huge precipice while the angry waters waved in the abyss below often the circumstances were so strong that the bounds of fancy contained them no longer and hastily awaking scarcely could she assure herself that zofloya stood not at the side of her bed at one time the delusion was so strong that she even fancied after gazing for a minute at least that he was a few paces from her bed and that she saw him turn and walk slow and majestically towards the door at this being no longer able to resist she started up and called him by his name but as she did so he seemed to vanish through the door which still remained shut surprised she passed her handover her eyes and looked round the chamber all was lonely she beheld no further traces of his figure and difficult as was the persuasion she endeavoured to believe the whole a delusive dream at length she laid down and closed her eyes again the weariness of sleep oppressed her to such a degree as to deprive her wholly of motion but notwithstanding this her eyes half opened involuntarily a grey silvery mist filled the chamber shedding a sort of twilight the curtains at the foot of her bed opened wide and in the same spot again stood the figure of zofloya with one hand he seemed to hold berenza whose countenance of pallid hue seemed convulsed in the agonies of death on his bare bosom appeared large marks of livid blue and his eyes stretched wide gazed mournfully upon the oppressed victoria in his other hand the moor held by her beautiful and flaxen tresses the orphan lilla her thin and spectral form seemed strayed in transparent shade her lovely head drooped and on one side of it was seen a deep wound from which the blood had streamed adown her aerial robes while still incapable of volition victoria gazed berenza and lilla vanished back and she beheld instead her own likeness and that of henriquez stand on either side of the moor she seemed to stretch forth her arms into </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> into which henriquez appeared impelled but hastily retreating she saw that his bosom was disfigured by a dreadful wound suddenly berenza and lilla again drew nigh resplendent wings which dazzled her eyes came from the shoulders of lilla with a seraphic smile she extended her hands to berenza and henriquez and rising with them from the ground victoria beheld them no longer her heart beat violently her brain throbbed and essaying to rise she found herself no longer incapable of motion victoria having passed a night of restlessness and agitation fell into a slumber towards morning from which she did not awaken till late in the afternoon when she entered the saloon to join the family at dinner her eyes irresistibly fixed upon the figure of zofloya who slew with alacrity to procure her a seat during dinner she was silent and abstracted and her regard continued involuntarily to turn towards him in one of those hasty glances which pride would alone permit her to steal it occurred to her that the figure of the moor possessed a grace and majesty which she had never before remarked his face too seemed animated with charms till now unnoticed and his very dress to have acquired a more splendid tasteful and elegant appearance true it was that great was the beauty of zofloya to a form the most attractive and symmetrical though of superior height deriving every advantage too from the graceful costume of his dress was added a countenance spite of its colour endowed with the finest possible expression his eyes brilliant and large sparkled with inexpressible fire his nose and mouth were elegantly formed and when he smiled the assemblage of his features displayed a beauty that delighted and surprised but still to the present period all this had been unnoticed by victoria the oftener she looked towards him the more her astonishment increased that it should have been so and she could not help thinking that zofloya before his sudden disappearance and zofloya since his return were widely different of each other whenever she cast her eyes upon the moor she could perceive that he observed her and not observed her only but regarded her with a tender serious interest that filled her soul with a troubled sort of delight at times she even thought he looked at her with a peculiar earnestness and animation yet her pride felt no alarm but on the contrary she took pleasure in knowing that he gazed upon her his place was near the chair of henriquez yet was he assiduous in attending to her in every motion he displayed some new grace and in the eyes of the vain victoria his beauty increased every moment for this once though henriquez was in her mind and in her soul another occupied her attention and in spite of every attempt to divert it to other objects on that one as if by the irresistible force of magnetic attraction it perpetually turned to relieve herself from an indefinable oppression she soon rose from table and wandered into the garden there throwing herself on a seat she began to brood over her criminal passion and the wildest thoughts rioted for preeminence in her brain detestable berenza she suddenly exclaimed inspired by the basest hatred and ingratitude towards him detestable berenza selfish and unworthy wretch that played upon my youth and deluded me into the misfortune of becoming thy wife had it not been for thee and thy cursed arts henriquez ere now would have been mine the baby lilla i would have banished from his heart i would have rooted her thence or from the earth but that my energies are all enslaved my powers fettered by the hated name of wise henriquez should have yielded to my love he should not have yielded only but have gloried in it who is the minion lilla a friendless upstart she was no obstacle i think not of her detestable berenza i say againmean calculating philosopher it is thouthou that i should wish annihilated as she concluded a faint echo seemed to repeat her last words in a low hollow tone as if sounding at a distance and borne by the wind what was that said victoria mentally but the sounds returned not hah it was some mockery she pursued while a deep sigh burst from her guilty bosom she drew her hand mechanically across her eyes for a moment and as she removed it she beheld zofloya standing though at a respectful distance before her surprise accompanied by an emotion of anger lightened through her mind that an inferior should thus presume to intrude upon her retirement this latter sentiment however faded in an instant before the majestic presence of the moor she looked upon him with an anxious air but did not speak and observed that in his hand he carried a bouquet of roses beautiful signora he said in a gentle voice and gracefully inclining his body pardon me that thus i venture to appear uncalled before you but these roses i gathered for you suffer me to strew them at your feet so saying he attempted to scatter them before her zofloya cried victoria while her eyes wandered with admiration over the beauty of his form noyou shall not strew them at my feet give them to me and let me place them in my bosom there are too many for your bosom sweet signora but i will select you some and of the rest i will form you a carpet he took the choicest rose from the bouquet and strewed the remainder at the feet of victoria then extending his hand he presented to her the rose which he had selected victoria stretched forth her hand to receive it when as she did so a thorn ran deep into one of her fingers and the blood </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> blood issued in a large drop zofloya in apparent consternation opened his vest and tearing some linen from his bosom cast himself upon his knees and applied it with trembling eagerness to the wound victoria felt too surprisedalmost gratified to repulse him and the moor continued unchecked to press the blood from her finger and to absorb it with the linen as it flowed at length it ceased to do so zofloya pressed the crimsoned linen to his heart and tearing from it every particle that remained unstained he folded it upas a sacred relic and placed it in his bosom then seeming suddenly to recollect himself he appeared struck with confusion at his own audacity he dared not raise his eyes to victoria and a darkred blush animated with lurid colour his expressive countenance victoria feeling irresistibly impelled laid her hand upon his shoulder and in gentle voice said rise zofloya and be not ashamed for you have not done aught amiss say you so signora i rise then with confidence and rising as he spoke he humbly retreated a few paces from her but why zofloya inquired victoria with a smile have you deemed that piece of linen worthy preservation worthy lovely signora answered the moor raising his fine eyes to her countenance and crossing his arms upon his bosom nit is of more worth to me than language can describe it is of equal value to me with yourself for it is a part of youyour precious blood chary will i be of it and safely placed upon my bosom no earthly power shall tempt me to resign it as he concluded his countenance glowed with a brilliant fire and increased animation spread itself over his graceful form the vanity of victoria was flattered in no guise did she disdain flattery but was astonished at herself however that with such disparity of situation it should be sweet to her she desired to banish all hostile reflection and gazing upon the attractive moor she saw such unconquerable fascination that her eyes sought the ground as fearful to express the conscious emotion of her bosom wherefore zofloya she involuntarily said in a tremulous voice do you remain at such a distance may i then approach signora you may the moor drew nigh but as victoria still remained in a recumbent attitude he seated himself upon the earth at her feet an oppressive gloom now took possession of the mind of victoria a weight of misery seemed pressing on her heart and covering her face with her hands she heaved a deep sigh you sigh sweet signora said the moor in a sympathising accent may zofloya venture to demand the cause the cause zofloyaah it is a cause which you cannot remove it is a wound for which there is no balm not so perhaps signora there was little in the words of zofloya to excite hope in the bosom of victoria yet enlivening hope shot through her bosom and she half rose from her reclining attitude zofloya she said in a doubting accent finding that he did not proceed what hope could you offer me some perhaps signoraname your grief she started wildly from her seat moor she exclaimed your words are big with meaning they contain more than meets the ear quick and tell me boldly all you would say zofloya rose from the ground he presumed to take the hand of victoria and led her again to her seat in a moment she was calm know signora deign to acknowledge to me what secret oppresses and has for long oppressed your soul the moor zofloya may repay you for your confidence the secret of victoria hovered on her lips hitherto it had remained unknown to mortal soul in the gloomy solitude of her own perturbed bosom had she till now preserved it where like a poisonous worm it had continued to corrode she was now on the point of betraying her inmost thoughts her dearest wishes her dark repining and hopeless desires of betraying them too to an inferior and an infidel the idea was scarcely endurable and she scorned it but in the next instant she cast her eyes upon the noble presence of the moor he appeared not only the superior of his race but of a superior order of beings her struggles died away and in hurried accents she involuntarily exclaimed soh henriquez henriquez the moor smiled why dost thou smile zofloya cried victoria with momentary indignation you love henriquez signora eyes yesto madnessto distraction how canst thou smile unfeeling moor hare you not a holy catholic signora yet to love so much an earthly being smock me not at this moment zofloya for that being i would forfeit my hopes of heaven you smile again i perceive i have condescended too far you dare to make sport of my miseries no no beautiful signora i smile only at your innocence my innocence she repeated with surprise for conscience whispered that long since had fled eyes signora at your innocence that in the midst of wishes so consuming could not instruct you to obtain them soh saycan you instruct me can you arrange can you direct the confused suggestions of my brain i think i could assist you fair signora soh zofloya you would bind me forever to you eagerly exclaimed victoria enough lovely signora tomorrow at the dusk of the evening deign to meet me again here i see approaching towards usil conte berenza and signor henriquez hah i see them soothe hated berenza she said while stronger loathing against him took possession of her heart farewell signora till tomorrow said zofloya and precipitately leaving the arbour he took a contrary path to that in which berenza and henriquez were advancing victoria continued with indescribable sensations to gaze after his graceful figure as it disappeared from </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> from her view then reluctantly leaving the arbour she joined the conte and henriquez with tremulous delight and with feelings of diminished pain she stole frequent glances at the unconscious possessor of her soul he observed her not for the blooming lilla was hastening towards them in an instant he quitted the side of victoria and flew towards her at this sight hate kindled fiercer than ever in the bosom of victoria she regarded the lovely orphan with the eyes of a basilisk and wished that like them they possessed the power to destroy vain this evening were the mild endearments of lilla she repulsed them with haughtiness for the feelings in her bosom raged too strong to permit the assumption of kindness and she experienced that however her conversation with zofloya might have imparted hope and have soothed in a degree the anguish of her mind still it had increased to the highest point of irritability every violent and bitter sensation scarcely on the following evening had the artificial shades of twilight increased the gigantic outlines of the foreseen mountains ere victoria hastened to the spot where the moor zofloya had said he would await her on her arrival she found him already there and on perceiving her he hastened forward be seated fair signora he said respectfully leading her to a sloping bank overshadowed by a spreading acacia victoria obeyed the manner of zofloya was such as inspired involuntary awe he took his station beside her the soul of victoria was a stranger to fear yet uncommon sensations filled her bosom as she observed her proximity to the moor the dim twilight increasing to darkness which now began to spread its sombre shadows around threw a deeper tint over his figure and his countenance was more strongly contrasted by the snow white turban which encircled his brows and by the large bracelets of pearl upon his arms and legs yet his from and attitude as he sat beside her was majestic and solemnly beautiful not the beauty which may be freely admired but acknowledged with sensations awful and indescribable signora he began in an harmonious voice while every uneasy feeling of victorias bosom vanished as he spoke i am not to learn that dreadful oppression of soul weighs you to the earth but the cause of your unhappiness i desire to hear from your own lips more explicitly than you have yet acknowledged it think not beautiful victoria that in the spirit of idle curiosity merely i would dive into the recesses of your bosom no it is from a hope i entertain that i possess a power equal almost to my wishes of alleviating the sorrows you endure but even should i not possess that power even then there is a delight of which you will speedily become sensible in confiding them to a sympathising breast victoria hesitatedthe moor proceeded does the signora believe then that the moor zofloya hath a heart dark as his countenance ah signora judge ye not by appearances but if you desire relief make me at once the depositary of your souls conflicts and trust to the event scarce had zofloya opened his lips ere uneasiness as we have said vanished from the mind of victoria as he proceeded the most agreeable sensations fluttered through her frame and in her brain floated fascinating visions of future bliss that passed too rapidly to be identified scarce had his silver tones sunk on her ear in thrilling cadence than she felt even eager to express to the moor her inmost thoughts excessive yet confused pleasure filled her heartache looked upon his still discernible though darkened figure upon his countenance where like two diamonds revealed by the force of their own casual rays his eyes emitted sparks of lambent flame involuntarily softened towards him she said whether or not thou canst assist me zofloya is unknown to me but feeling strongly impelled to reveal to thee every movement of my soulthe fatal i almost fear the remediless cause of my misery i hasten to acknowledge to thee all i have already hinted to thee concerning my love although the wife of conte berenza my inmost soul doats franticly upon the young henriquez to complete my hopeless distraction the orphan lilla that presumptuous and dependant intruder hath for long been in possession of his heart an heart of which she knows not the value for her person is not more puerile than her mind but it is not the artful insignificant ascendancy this girl has acquired over him that bids me despair it isit is that i am wedded to a wretch whom i abhorwho stands between me and happiness and who was only sent upon this earth to seal the fiat of my miseries were i but once freedfreed from those hated fetters that bind me to berenza i would soon drive from the superior mind of henriquez the silly passion which now occupies it i would make him feel that he was destined to nobler fate to confer and to receive the highest happiness not merely to yield himself a sacrifice to the undiscriminating fancy of his boyish days oh zofloya this would i do were opportunity allowed mebut never oh never will such bliss be mine she leaned her head upon her hand and paused then quickly resuming i have now told thee of the agony which racks my breast i have even revealed my wishesmy despairsay say quickly what consolation canst thou offer in return i would bid you signora not despair hand is this all thou canst say zofloya hare you of a firm and persevering spirit signora this heart knows not to shrink she answered forcibly striking her bosom while her eyes flashed fire hand in its purpose would persevere even to destruction hare such the attributes of your character signora then what </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> what earthly wishes are not to be atchieved by the united force of firmness and perseverance i see not how firmness and perseverance can avail me here however valuable in themselves may be those qualities not so beautiful victoria your words are ambiguous zofloya deign to be explicit said victoria hastily will you consider me so when i assert that if you determine to act up to what you have just said no accidental combinations can prevent you from obtaining your utmost wishes shah say you so enchanting moor exclaimed victoria half frantic with joy at the meaning contained in his words and breathless with contending emotions of hope and doubt seizing his hand she pressed it to her bosom signora be calm be composed cried zofloya hand honor not thus unworthily the lowest of your slaves speak on then zofloya your words are magic they soothe my soul and i feel hope hand if i speak on you will not bid me cease you will not shrink signora victorias only answer was an expressive smile and gesture zofloya then resumed before signora by the unhappy defeat of my countrymen in granada by ferdinand of arragon i became the property of the spaniard who dying recommended me to signor henriquez i had from early youth been addicted to the study of arts as well as arms botany chemistry and astrology were my favorite pursuits and this turn of mind was further encouraged and improved by an ancient moor of granada who took pleasure in cultivating my taste and eventually increased considerably my information on various points and to a surprising extent while in the kingdom of arragon resident with the spaniard my late master i continued to have full leisure for the pursuit of my favorite branches of study for he treated me as a friend and an equal rather than as a miserable captive and domestic soh zofloya zofloya impatiently cried victoria this is irrelevant suffer me to proceed however signora gravely observed the moor with an air that repressed the violence and commanded the attention of his auditor hin consequence of the liberty i enjoyed i devoted myself as i have said to my favorite pursuits i obtained a perfect knowledge of simples and earths and how drugs are compounded from them no one could go beyond the infallibility of my calculations as to their effect to chemistry then i became particularly attached without however resigning my astrological pursuits close application savored too as perseverance usually is by the deductions of accidental observation taught me in time amidst a vast variety of chemical science to compound poisons with such infinite art that from the most speedy and subtile i could vary their degrees to the slowest and most imperceptible i tried them experimentally as it were first upon animals and then upon those who had offended me victoria started but the moor appearing not to notice it proceeded upon these i tried alternately my speedy and lingering poisons i have seen the little greyhound one moment frisking at my feet and the next without a struggle sink motionless beside them i have seen the man i hated who had forgotten he had ever offended me smiling in my face and lingering under the imperceptible but certain influence of the poison that had been administered to him and which circulated in his blood gently leading him to the gates of death for the female who had dared to prefer another to me i have first wreaked my vengeance on her lover and then on herself by the power of the drugs i have given them their love for each other has been alternately changed to hate and they have only recovered from the delirium to be separately destroyed by the effect in no instance have i ever failed in my calculations of the event that which i willed came to pass and came to pass in the manner that i willed it many other surprising secrets of art and nature became revealed to me but to expatiate upon them now would be as you have said irrelevant to the subject therefore to the points now demand of you signora whether you would choose the slow poison or the swift victoria was for a moment staggered at this unexpected question which again the moor seeming not to observe took from his pocket a small gold box which opening victoria perceived to contain several divisions from one of these he drew a little folded paper and thus proceeded this paper contains one of the most subtile and delicate poisons that ever by the hand of art could be composed it deals unerring death but deals it slowly it may be administered in wine in food it may even be completely introduced into the system by the puncture of the smallest pin it is this which i should recommend to you signora for a begining take it and use it as opportunity shall present should opportunities but unfrequently occur you will yourself know how to make them victoria stretched forth her hand and took the paperfor a moment she was silent and then said this then is for berenza the moor smiled expressively and waved his hand as if to say that surely requires no answer then assuming a more serious air he coolly observed when barriers oppose the attainment of a favorite object the barriers must either be laid low or the object remain unattained to remedy an evil it is necessary to strike at the root nothing is to be gained by lopping the branches which arise therefrom thus should you resolve to overstep common boundaries and that which is termed female delicacy by openly declaring your passion to henriquez and he even setting defiance to consequence should return it how do you imagine that while the wife of another you could enjoy </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> enjoy unrestrained delight with the choice of your soul do you want resolution then fair signora to effect by means so trifling your highest wishesand did i err he added ironically hin the different estimate i had formed of your character nit is not that i want resolution returned victoria somewhat piqued i desire oh how ardently desire the death the annihilation of berenza but by these means to take his lifeit is not that i hesitate however and ashamed confused at what she deemed her cowardice she flopped nit is not that you hesitate in an accent half serious half disdainful returned the moor hand why should you hesitate he had no hesitation in sacrificing to himself your young and beautiful person for his gratification and why should you hesitate now at sacrificing him for yours you hate him yet you receive with dissembled pleasure those endearments which he lavishes upon you in depriving him of life you would do him far less wrong surely the conscience of victoria is not subjugated to a confessor from whence then arises this unexpected demur is not self predominant throughout animal nature and what is the boasted supremacy of man if eternally he must yield his happiness to the paltry suggestions of scholastic terms or the pompous definitions of right and wrong his reasoning mind then is given him only for his torment and to wage war against his happiness yet what cause can be adduced why another must be permitted to stand between him and his fair prospects overshadowing them with hopeless gloom what argument can be adduced against his removal for him of whom we are speaking he has enjoyed already many years of existent pleasure he must now yield his place to another for he has nota right to monopolize to his share the pleasures of others besides were he to live a thousand years longer each day must be but a tasteless repetition of the past for in length of time even the zest of pleasure wears off and when we come to reflect after this long disquisition into which we have been drawn what is the momentous consideration whether the breath of a man be hastened a few moments sooner from his body than sickness accident or a thousand chances might have propelled it and in the common course of things have befriended youyet if none of these happen to arise a mind of enterprise endowed with the strength and power of right reason steps with shrinking foot a little from the beaten track zofloya pausedthe cool deliberateness of his manner in expressing his sentiments induced victoria to believe that they were the result of conviction deduced from accurate reflection and the having given to the subject the rational consideration of a towering and superior mind rather than the cruel or forced constructions of the moment under this impression she could not avoid saying zofloya you possess strong powers of reflection and you are eloquent charming signora in a softened voice answered the moor i am not naturally eloquent but the wish of promoting your happiness renders me so pride filled the heart of victoria and she smiled hah pursued the moor that beauteous form was never made to pine by hopeless loveno it was not made to sink to the earth a victim to ungratified sensations to yield to fall a sacrifice to imperious circumstances ah victoria beautiful victoria zofloya must fly you in despair should you disdain his proffered services oh flattery like heavenly dew upon the earth gratefully dost thou descend upon the ear of woman indescribable leasure dilated the bosom of victoria as she listened to the honied accents of the delicate moor she put forth her hand towards him and when he softly seized and pressed it to his lips the haughty venetian was not offended tell me then zofloya she said with slight hesitation show must i use this bland and dangerous enemy at night in wine signora in morning beverage when and how you can ere long its effects will become discernible the conte at a certain hour of the day drinks lemonade observed victoria which i was once in the habit of administering to him he used to say it tasted sweeter from my hand renew your tender offices said zofloya with a meaning smile hand increase your opportunities the powder i have given you is of the minutest particles the smallest atom is sufficient at a time using it at the rate of twice a day it will not be exhausted for ten days at the end of that period the perceptible effect that shall have been produced upon berenza will direct us to proceed now signora allow me to conduct you hence so saying zofloya gently taking victoria by the arm led her with a kind of respectful freedom from the spot with shrinking soul and eye unabashed by the consciousness of guilt victoria joined at supper the innocent family circle the high blush of animation flushed her dark cheek with more than usual fire her eyes sparkled but it was with a fiendlike exultation and her nerves seemed new strung for the execution of her dreadful purpose berenza rejoiced at her appearance and little surmising the cause approached in the fulness of his heart to embrace her she returned it impatiently and pushing him from her surveyed him with a kind of half smile from head to foot the unconscious berenza mistook this for the embrace of eager love repentant at past coldness and the accompanying action for sportive gaiety only but it was not so victoria hastily embraced him from the cruel reflection that he would not long have the power of soliciting these marks of an affection that she felt not nor she the hated task of granting them in pushing him from her she but yielded </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> yielded to an overpowering impulse of the hatred which possessed her bosom while gazing on him with a smile she consoled herself with the thoughthow soon he would cease to be at supper she could not forbear sometimes casting her ardent eyes upon henriquez anticipating future delight while his were fixed as usual upon the blooming fairy lilla but her victoria now regarded only with contempt from the suggestion that she was an atom too easily crushed to cause a moments painful thought yet she failed not to pay attention to all and the vivacity of her manner the brilliancy of her wit attracted as it was wont to do the pleased admiration of all towards her come my life cried the enraptured berenza raising the glass to his lips theres to thy happiness and the success of thy every wish drink all of you the same he added looking round the table every one obeyed and drank to the happiness of her who in that moment meditated their destruction hand now she cried playfully nit is my turn and taking two goblets off the table she flew to a recess at the end of the saloon where wines and ices were set out upon a small marble table filling them to the brim with vino greco and infusing into the glass that had been hers a small quantity of the poison which instantly incorporated itself with the wine and disappeared she returned to the supper table with welldissembled innocent sportiveness and exclaimed fill your glasses all round all obeyed again and held their glasses in their hands there berenza is my glass she cried drink from it as i will drink from yoursto the speedy fulfilment of our wishes the fatal toast was drunk and sto the speedy fulfilment of our wishes echoed round the table while the devoted berenza whose only wish was the gratification of victoria drank eagerly to promote it the first draught of death and looking tenderly upon her exclaimed sto the speedy fulfilment of thy wishes thus emphatically calling on his own destruction victoria smiling fixed her eyes upon him in a few moments she imagined he turned pale he passed his hand hastily across his eyes as if sensible of a slight sudden pain in his head she became apprehensive she had given him more than was prudent for a first dose and that she would be betrayed presently however her fears subsided the colour returned to the cheeks of berenza and the pain passed away uninterrupted gaiety then reigned to the end of supper and till the lateness of the hour warned them to separate from this eventful period victoria omitted no opportunity of administering insidious death to the unsuspicious berenza sometimes with the point of a small fruit knife which she retained about her for the purpose she introduced the baleful poison within the fruit while offering it to him on the point of her knife thus remorselessly rendering him to himself the dealer of his own death after once or twice the poison no longer took an immediately perceptible effect upon him the stomach becoming habituated no longer evinced resistless loathing as it received the gradual destruction which blending its baleful influence with its other juices was conveyed into the system at the expiration of eight or ten days a change scarcely marked by others but fully perceived by victoria became apparent in the hapless berenza the blood of his cheeks which on first taking the poison vanished back for a few moments seemed as by repeated checks to have become more languid in its circulation and tinged them no longer as formerly with the vermilion hue of health a kind of tremulousness began to possess his nerves and a dry but faint cough gave frequent symptoms that the mischief had begun to work satisfied with these appearances on the evening of the tenth day for the eagerness of victoria now that she had commenced her dreadful plan had not suffered an atom of the poison to remain beyond she sought as previously agreed zofloya in the appointed spot when she arrived she perceived him not already her dark mind became suspicious of the delay zofloya zofloya she cried in an under voice where art thou there replied a voice like the sweet murmuring sound of an olian harp swept by the breath of the zephyr and turning she beheld at her side the towering figure of the moor she had not seen neither had she heard his approach and ashamed of the doubts she had felt and the impatience she had evinced she could not as his commanding eyes looked down upon her for the moment speak well beautiful victoria he said behold me here and suffer me now to ask does hope begin to cheer your longbenighted bosom eyes answered victoria i entertain hope the fond hope zofloya that i shall have good cause to mark the day when irresistibly impelled by the kind sympathy of thy manner i confided to thee the cause of my sorrows and i too signora shall have proud cause to mark that day for it gave to the unworthy slave zofloya the most beautiful and enterprising of her sex nit gave thee my friendship indeed zofloya said victoria slightly surprised nit gave thee my gratitude not myself for i am irrevocably as thou knowest devoted to another be not offended beautiful victoria nor let us waste the precious moments in defining terms for the signor henriquez to whom i am obedient for your sweet sake alone requires my presence were it not for you zofloya would no longer appear in a character unfitting his state the character of a menial hand what would you then generous zofloya for sure you were the attendant of henriquez ere i became known to you were you otherwise than </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> than you are fair victoria i should not now be here his it even sothen am i indeed indebted to you most excellent moor for the sacrifices which you make to my service and never never can i sufficiently repay you you will you do repay me kind signora but time wastes let me now give what you require the second powder for he concluded his meaning with a smile then taking the box from his pocket he drew forth a second powder but from a different division and presenting it to victoria he said this powders a degree more powerful than the last you will administer it the same and the effects will be proportionably increased this likewise will last you ten days and in that time you will observe in berenza the flame of life become fainter and fainter to all around his illness will wear the appearance of languor and gentle decay no one will suspect death to be at hand by you some cold caught and unnoticed at the time must be fondly alluded to and suggested as the cause by tenderness and unlimited attention by soothing and consolation you must shut his eyes on the danger of his situation and administer with your poison the fallacious hope that his constitution will triumph over the cureless malady so that no advice and if possible not any medicines may be resorted to left they should counteract or retard the workings of his delicate enemy you will thus behold him perishing away like the rose which carries the cankerworm hidden in its heart or the tree that blasted by the lightning can never more recover its verdure the moor paused but victoria appearing violently agitated as if overcome by some sudden thought or recollection remained silent her uneasiness was not unobserved by zofloya but he only gazed upon her without inquiring the cause leaving it to herself to reveal the workings of her mind at length fixing her eyes upon his countenance she said in a hurried voice zofloya venice will never do for the seat of action it would be folly it would be madness to make the attempt such an undertaking as ours if crowned by success would prove ultimate destruction know you not know you not zofloya that nothing can remain concealed from il consilio di diei but you commit no crime against the state signora you are no heretic true but the pretended accusation for these crimes are frequently the vehicles of punishment for other offences hatred suspicion or malice conveys an anonymous line into the lions mouth the familiars of the holy inquisition are every where and though summoned before its awful tribunal upon false grounds the torture soon wrests from you a confession of those offences of which you have been really guilty no zofloya the attainment of my object avails me nothing if destruction follows the momentary triumph well signora though i think that your fears magnify the danger yet the alternative which occurs is easy persuade the conte to quit venice but whither to go she said with an embarrassed air hall italy is equally dangerous zofloya made an impatient gesture as if to reprove the hesitation of victoria after a moment she resumed i have heard berenza speak of torre alto it is the name of a castle appertaining to him which is situated among the apennines a retirement there would at least suit your purpose the prying steps of curiosity will not follow you and discovery cannot reach you but should berenza object as i have hitherto done to a temporary removal thither then can you adduce a thousand reasons a desire for solitude a wish to visit a spot you have never yet seen or lastly a suggestion that change of air and situation might speedily restore his health nit shall be so zofloya pity the distraction of a wretch whose mind is rendered imbecile by misery and who of herself is incapable of an effort towards her own happiness aided and advised by thee i may command success the moor smiled your fate your fortune fair signora will be of your own making i am but the humble tool the slave of your wishes your cooperation with me can alone render me powerful but fly me disdain my assistance and despise my friendship i sink abashed into myself and am powerless farewel signora i have already staid too long for the present you need me no more abruptly then zofloya turned away and quitted the presence of victoria who took her steps musingly towards the house at supper soon as with wine and conversation the spirits of berenza became joyous and elevated she artfully seized an opportunity of introducing the subject nearest her heart she spoke of torre alto and expressed a desire to visit its sublime solitudes professing herself to be still further influenced from the flattering presumption looking tenderly at berenza as she made the assertion that change of atmosphere and a more elevated situation might be a means of bracing his nerves and restoring him to his pristine health whatever the tender and unsuspicious berenza believed it was enough for him that victoria expressed the wish for him unhesitatingly to comply with it while the welcome but fallacious hope pressed upon his heart that devoted to love and him and desirous to prove to him that she was so she abandoned without regret the vain pleasures and amusements of the voluptuous city for a solitude no longer unpleasing to her charmed at this return to reason and rationality he fondly persuaded himself that the evening of his days would close like the brilliant beauty of a western sky declining into the shadows of night fearful even that her purpose might change he expatiated on the beauty the situation of his castella and desirous to offer every </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> every possible allurement to her perseverance he entreated that henriquez his fair mistress and her ancient protectress would be of the intended party to this henriquez who fondly loved his brother readily acquiesced and ventured to promise for lilla and the signora as with a smile he looked towards them to deprecate the possibility of a refusal victoria perceiving in the hapless berenza such unhoped for eagerness in coincidence with her plan artfully forbore to press the subject further but her alarm being awakened lest the relation of lilla should object to the journey and thereby an idea that was not endurable detain henriquez in venice she exerted the fascinations of her kindness towards her and observed with seeming pleasure as if the point of her acquiescence had been settled what infinite benefit would in all probability result to her own health inconsequence of the salubrious change the poor old signora did not exactly think so but it was enough that victoria condescended to say it and to direct towards her unusual attention for her not to hesitate besides as selflove is no less inherent in age than youth she felt no little gratification in being deemed of sufficient consequence for solicitation all preliminaries being speedily arranged it was agreed ere they rose from table that the following day should only intervene for the conclusion of some necessary preparations and that on the subsequent morning they would take their departure from the gay city of venice for the castella di torre alto among the apennines on a lovely morning early in spring the party descending the steps of st marks embarked on the brent for the apennines victoria seated by the side of berenza administered to him the tenderest the most deceitful attentions the fair and beautiful lilla with her long flaxen tresses almost veiling her fairy form seated by the side of henriquez caught the soft breathing of his love and without looking upon him felt the warm glances of his eyes which thrilled with voluptuous tenderness her innocent soul the aged signora proud to be among the youthful party though of little interest to any save her orphan charge sat contented in the enjoyment of other for venerable age but rarely attracts the portion of consideration which is due to it zofloya towering as a demigod with his plumed and turbaned head his dark form contrasted and embellished by his bracelets of pearl and by the snowy hue of his garments was stationed near the stern of the vessel and ravished the surrounding party with his exquisite harmony to which even the undulating waves in the rapt ear of enthusiastic fancy appeared to keep respectful music never was fatal journey performed under fairer auspices never with fonder triumph did the bridegroom conduct his long loved mistress to the altar than the poor berenza conducted to his solitude among mountains the faithless victoria he saw no solitude when she was by to him she was the peopled world of pleasure and in the fulness of his exhilarated heart he blest the moment which by visiting him with sickness restored him as he thought the affections of a wife he had feared was lost to him to be brieftheir journey concluded and arrived at torre alto victoria observed herself with a gloomy and secret delight enclosed within the profoundest solitudes for no town no hamlet was even near the castella of berenza which was situated in a deep valley on the borders of a forest on either side huge rocks towered above its loftiest spires and half embosomed it in terrible but majestic sublimity while no sound disturbed the solemn silence of the scene but the fall of the impetuous cataract as it tumbled from the stupendous acclivity into the depths blow or the distant sound of the vesperbell tolling solemn from the nearest convent with at times when the wind blew towards the castle the murmuring peal of the loftysounding organ caught at intervals in the breeze seeming more like the mysterious music of the spirits of the air than sounds from mortal haunts there then said victoria as on the morning after her arrival she gazed from her chamber window upon the beautifully terrific scenery and the immeasurable waste of endless solitude which composed it there then without danger may i pursue the path leading to the summit of my wishes no prying eye can pierce through here the secret movements which to compass my souls desire may be requisite hail then to these blissful solitudes hail to them since they perhaps may first witness the rich harvest of my persevering love and for such a love perishperish all that may oppose it while thus she continued her eyes indeed wandering wildly over the world of mountains but her thoughts far far beyond them she was roused by the mild voice of berenza who gently seizing her arm smilingly inquired the subject of her reverie a faint blush suffused the guiltbronzed cheek of victoria as in a low voice she merely replied i was contemplating the grandeur of the surrounding scenery my lord hand do you know beloved victoria replied berenza that i fancy my health already improved from the effects of our journey this beautiful seclusion and these pure airs victoria felt that this idea of berenzas was indeed mere fancy for well she knew that on the preceding evening unrestrained by his fatigue the circumstances of the moment or the pallid cheek of berenza she had administered to him his deathdealing draught the bare assertion however that he did not feel ill disturbed her for the moment and she secretly resolved that in the next draught she would mingle more of the poison for the present however she accompanied him from the window and joined the party already assembled at breakfast persevering with relentless barbarity ere the ten days </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> days were concluded victoria had administered to the conte the last atom of the poison she therefore as evening came on wandered forth in hopes of encountering the moor with whom since her arrival at torre alto she had scarcely found an opportunity of conversing she took her way across the almost pathless forest for the deeper and more gloomy the solitude the more probable she thought it that zofloya would choose it for his haunt accordingly she had not proceeded far ere as if informed by sympathetic influence of her wishes she beheld the stately moor issuing from a break among the trees directly across her path she called to him aloud when slightly bowing he arrested his steps till she came up with him impatience to begin on subjects more important prevented her from remarking the cool and haughty conduct of zofloya who instead of proceeding rapidly to meet her had contented himself with awaiting her arrival at the spot where he stood zofloya she said as she took his arm and walked rapidly onwards can you not at once deliver me from the tortures i endure having embarked thus far my soul is sick of the delay i therefore implore if you desire to serve me that you will do it speedily and effectually signora answered the moor gravely your movements have already outstepped my directions and your precipitancy has gone near to defeat your views the present illness of the conte is of a nature to induce gradual and ultimate dissolution there is nothing in its appearance which in the common course of things could warrant the event of sudden death such an occurrence therefore would give immediate rise to suspicion with every colour of justice on its side behold therefore and pardon my abruptness he added there is that which will cause considerable change in the conte seven days will exhaust it but it must not be exhausted in a shorter period moreover signora i warn you that if my directions are in the smallest tittle infringed you weaken the power by which i act and destroy the effect which strict adherence to the rules laid down can alone produce then giving a small paper into the hands of victoria with distant air he bowed his head and striking immediately into the deep recesses of the wood became lost to her view singular being thought victoria as with slow and meditating steps she retook her path towards the castella show happens it that with a thousand questions to ask him i find time to ask him nothing and with a thousand inquiries to make respecting himself my tongue refuses in his presence to perform its office and i remain unsatisfied thus reflecting she increased her pace for the darkest shadows of evening were beginning to fall as she approached the castle she beheld coming as if to seek her the youthful henriquez unconscious object of the devouring flame that consumed her at sight of him her heart throbbed and various emotions filled her breast i come signora he cried as he drew near nat the desire of my brother he became impatient at your absence perhaps apprehensive at this late hour and entreated that i would seek and accompany you home a task said victoria in a reproachful accent which you would rather have been spared no indeed signora coolly though politely answered henriquez sto give a moments ease to the bosom of a beloved brother to attend to his last request and gratify even his most insignificant wishes i could never deem a task sto wish for me was indeed an insignificant wish gloomily observed victoria i said not so signora as he spoke the foot of victoria striking against a point of projecting stone she stumbled henriquez instinctively caught her arm victoria snatched it away resentfully and while tears almost started to her eyes she said no matter signor henriquez no matter to you if i fall good heaven signora why should you think thus how have i given rise to so unjust a surmise you know you know you hate in an agitated voice cried victoria thrown entirely off her guard henriquez looked towards her with surprise and at a loss what to reply bowed with an embarrassed air victoria remained silent for a few moments and then in a calmer voice resumed had the conte desired you to seek lilla with what alacrity would you have obeyed hah returned henriquez with animation who could have reminded me to seek lilla since my eyes accustomed to dwell upon her would so soon have missed their wonted delight victoria scowled with mingled rage and jealousy upon henriquez but he looked not towards her and if he had the hour had been almost too dark for him to distinguish the expression of her countenance which was so terrible it might almost have been felt by inspiration by degrees however she quelled the violence of her sensations and in a smothered voice observed henriquez you love lilla love he emphatically replied i adore her i idolize her she is the light of my eyes the sunshine of my soul the spring which actuates my existence without her life to me would be a dreary blank and if fate snatched her from mein this world i would die yes hasten to die that my soul might rejoin her in the next and my body repose by her pure form in the grave soh madness madness muttered victoria and involuntarily grasped henriquez by the arm signora are you ill he cried instantly stopping no no no but i i was almost on the point of falling again she answered gasping for breath and in that instant she wavered whether the powder she retained in her bosom should not be destined to lilla rather then berenza while this idea crossed her </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> her mind she beheld the innocent girl bounding towards them through the gloom seeming like an arial spirit seen by the dubious light scarcely appearing in its delicate movements to touch the ground instantly the rage of her bosom changed into laughing contempt she felt her least power could at any time annihilate this the most fragile of natures productions and disdained herself that she had even cast a thought upon an atom so insignificant henriquez flew instantly to meet her victoria slowly followed and altogether entered the castle the tender lilla with her right hand holding one of victorias and passing the left round her waist proceeding to the room where berenza awaited them they found him stretched at length upon a sopha which being of crimson colour added a more deadly tinge to the paleness of his complexion as soon as he beheld victoria he stretched forth his hand to her and exclaimed soh my love whither have you been i have been wishing for my tender nurse to make me a glass of lemonade i have been walking in the forest my love replied victoria and i went further then i intended but let me hasten to prepare your drink so saying she quitted the room and in a few moments returned with a glass of lemonade into which she had already infused a sufficient quantity of poison its additional force discomfited as at first the debilitated stomach of the unfortunate berenza for he had drunk it all with avidity complaining of faintish sickness he motioned for victoria to sit beside him and leaning his head upon her faithless bosom seemed presently overcome by a profound sleep soon however it became disturbed and interrupted by convulsive catching that innocent breath which issued from his lips and passed over the face of victoria spoke no reproach to her remorseless bosom a feverish glow passed over his cheek and now was succeeded by a deadly paleness now his hand involuntarily shook and now different parts of his body yielded to a tremulous convulsion his lips quivered his eyelids became agitated by a nervous motion and he halfopened his eyes over which there appeared a dimness like a thin film again the heart of victoria yielded to selfish terror lest she had administered too powerful a dose of the poison berenza however was not awake though his eyes remained half open she took his burning hand and actuated by her fears strongly pressed it the action recalled in a moment the fleeting senses of berenza he started and opened his eyes from which the film vanished then perceiving the false victoria bending over him the complaint he was about to utter died upon his lips and fearful of giving uneasiness to her who was deliberately consuming his life he even repressed the look of anguish straining it into a tender smile and smothered the sigh of agony which was bursting from his bosom dear berenza you are ill cried victoria gazing with dissembled fondness in his face only a little languid my beloved answered he a few glasses of wine will reanimate me so saying he rose endeavouring to conceal the access of weakness of which he became sensible from the eyes of every one but more particularly from those of victoria and requesting they might repair to the supper room he was that night permitted not from her compassion but her base policy to drink his wine unmingled with the baleful poison yet bitterly she regretted what she felt to be so necessary an intermission the allotted week had not expired ere change sufficient was visible in the unfortunate berenza to satisfy even the soul of victoria thirsting as it was for his innocent blood it was in vain that he gazed on her with eyes of dying fondness it was in vain that when oppressed by raging thirst he called on her for drink and would receive it from no hand but hers even this disarmed not her heart of its fell purpose even this touched it not with an emotion of pity or remorse still she infused with hand restricted only by fear of danger to herself the consuming poison into the coveted draught which so far from allaying the fever of his blood was as oil to the devouring flame still berenza dreamed not that his death was nigh true he felt within him an inanity as it were a languor of the heart with sometimes a kind of distaste and weariness of former objects he knew not precisely the nature of his own sensations for they varied occasionally often his spirits were animated but then it was an animation which diffused not its vivifying current through the pulses of his heart it sprang not thence neither did it leave cheerfulness behind it seemed independent of himself as the artificial vivacity which is raised by the power of wine always after the animal spirits had been thus pressed into action as it were he became feebler and more dejected from the strained exertion this victoria observing and instantly concluding that wine while it exhilarated him for the moment must still tend to parch up the vital heat she induced him to drink plentifully of it thereby causing it to answer the double purpose of blinding him to his actual danger and hastening his death his cough had now become more serious exercise was fatiguing to him and all society but that of victoria irksome thus was he completely in her power but nevertheless she durst not go beyond the directions of zofloya the person of the conte however underwent no considerable alteration his complexion only had become somewhat pallid though occasionally it glowed with a transparent red but though feeble and slightly emaciated his appetite was increased even to covetousness from this circumstance he could not believe himself in </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> in actual danger but rather coincided with the pretended hope of victoria that time and a naturally robust constitution would triumph over a disorder that he firmly attributed as victoria had suggested to some neglected and unnoticed cold the wilds of the apennines seldom tempted him to roam with the inhabitants of a few gloomy castella scattered here and there at immense distances from his own he never associated and victoria affirmed in order to keep him more secure and avoid the remotest risk of drawing attention towards them that quiet and rest were absolutely indispensable to his recovery whatever she willed right or otherwise was law to the fond the dying berenza who forgot in her present apparent tenderness towards him and seeming devotement all former coolness and discontent at the very moment in which with treacherous hand but looks of love she held towards him the life destroying draught in that moment was she dearer to his soul than ever and often ere he put it to his parched lips did he stay his eagerness to kiss the false hand that presented it in vain did henriquez entreat of his infatuated brother to receive advice to explain his sensations only to hear the opinion of a physician no he steadily refused victoria was allsufficient and on her tender care would he alone depend the poison however being now exhausted and the week elapsed victoria finding that the miserable berenza was not only yet in existence but that for the two last days he had not appeared more evidently reduced than he had for sometime past became absolutely impatient to a degree of savageness and cursed the feeble life that still struggled to retain possession of its wornout tenement deeming it therefore requisite to seek zofloya she again repaired to that part of the forest where she had last encountered him this time the moor seemed awaiting her and hastening towards her as she approached he said you are impatient signora at the strength of the contes constitution is it not sobut rest satisfied your end is answered he cannot long survive yet does he not appear worse this evening than he did eight days ago murmuring observed victoria probably not signora yet are the principles of life irreparably sapped and though you should now resign all further attempts to utterly destroy them though every aid of medicine might be essayed yet never now could nature recover herself for he must eventually and speedily perish but how soon or he may linger for years even till old age shall have chilled the ardent fires which now burn in my bosom till my passions shall have withered away and my energies become damped oh zofloya if you desire to serve me let it be at once hitherto you have but trifled the moor started back and looked scowlingly upon victoria never before had she beheld him look so terrible in an instant her proud rage subsided her eyes were cast on the earth and she trembled at what she had suffered to escape her lips yes victoria who never before trembled in the presence of mortal being who did not tremble to agonise and insult a father to revile a mother and consign a husband to the grave trembled now in the presence of zofloya to herself even the sensation she experienced was inexplicable and involuntarily approaching the moor who was still distant from her she took his hand and said forgive me zofloya pardon my abruptness and attribute it to the irksome delay i suffer in my hopes which confuses and distracts my brain tis well signora answered the moor gracefully yet haughtily bending and waving his hand you forgive me zofloya deign then to advise me i direct signora not advise and at the same time must observe that the fullest confidence is to be placed in me you have not yet found that i have deceived you it will be early enough for reproaches when you discover that i have spare them i beseech you then till the arrival of that period your doubts must vanish meantime and if you wish my assistance i must be suffered without comment to pursue that line best calculated to render it effectual i told you that the drug i gave you would work the destruction of the conte did i not add that it would work it slowly would you have desired it should be immediate to frustrate for ever your own hopes and end at once my business here well zofloya i will in all respects follow your directions relax then the sternness of your brow and smile upon me as usual beautiful victoria you are resistless cried zofloya dropping on one knee tis i now who sue for pardon and promise to devote myself to your service rise gentle moor and accept my hand cried the vain and flattered victoria never shall i have power to recompense you you recompense me signora in accepting my services deign now to listen to me you desire that berenza should be cut at once from the face of the earth i deem it more advisable that he should be left to the concluding effects of the poison he has already imbibed but that i may gratify your wishes and above all guard against the possibility of disappointment i have here a drug which i have known to be immediate in its operations left however it should accidentally fail in the present instance requiring perhaps a small addition of some corroborative quality or an increase of the dose i would recommend a previous trial upon some indifferent subject he paused i know of no subject said victoria musingly has not the orphan lilla an old female relative with her observed zofloya she is as far as i can see a most useless appendage and hereafter </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> hereafter might even prove troublesome true replied victoria she would answer excellently for an experiment the moor smiled with malice i would have you then signora lead the officious dame into the forest i will shortly appear as if by your previous desire with two glasses of wine or lemonade you will take the one which i shall put next to you and present the other to the old signora she is feeble and tottering on the verge of the grave should not an immediate effect be perceptible on her swallowing it we must add a grain for the benefit of the conte but should it not take instant effect we shall be betrayed zofloya leave that to me signora and suffer me to proceed on my having retired you shall run hastily towards the castle for assistance pretending which will be easily believed that the signora hath fallen down in a fit but should any marks of the poison become perceptible after her death interrupted the selfish victoria they will be naturally attributed to the mode of her death no suspicion rest assured shall be excitedtrust to me beautiful victoria i have an interest a deep interest in preserving you from exposure well give me the powder then i rely implicitly upon you the moor gave into her hand a small paper containing the poison and the following morning was agreed on for the trial of its efficacy separating then each reached the castle by different ways on the following morning victoria having watched her opportunity entered a little apartment where the aged and inoffensive signora was tranquilly sitting by a window inhaling through the bars of a blind the fresh breeze from the mountains solitary and forsaken by the younger branches of the family even by the gentle lilla who had been drawn away by henriquez she smiled with pleasure at the sight of victoria who more rarely than any one deigned to notice her what entirely alone signora she exclaimed as she entered come then in a gay and conciliating tone come let me lead you out you will find the open air do you more service than inhaling it through this confined medium the poor signora surprised and flattered at such wonderful condescension rose with trembling limbs yet with all the alacrity she could assume clean upon me good signora said victoria hand let me assist you the gratified and feeble signora respectfully accepted the offer panting with weakness she gained at length however the precincts of the forest here victoria though she cursed and dreaded the delay was under the necessity of permitting her for a few moments to rest upon her arm but her evil genius assisted her evil intent no one appeared in view and the fresh air having a little restored the imbecile powers of her unsuspecting companion she prevailed upon her to proceed and succeeded at length in luring her by the unusual honor of her attention to a more gloomy part of the forest where a rocky acclivity on one side offered at its base a rugged and projecting seat here victoria affecting to have selected this spot for its convenient attributes in shading them at once from the sun and the wind and likewise affording them a seat entreated the signora to rest while with treacherous kindness she assisted her to sit appearing then infinitely grieved at her evident weariness though the poor signora from complaisance and gratitude forbore complaint she observed to her you are indeed fatigued signora i apprehend the exertion has been too much for you allow me to return to the castle and procure you some refreshment though generally the moor zofloya brings me about this hour sherbet or lemonade the santa maria forbid replied the signora that you should give yourself any trouble a little rest will quite restore mebut i am no longer young signora at that moment victoria beheld among the trees the emeraldcovered turban of zofloya glittering to the sunbeam her heart leaped and she rose to receive from him the glasses of lemonade which he carried in a silver salver punctual intaking for herself that which the moor held towards her she presented the other to the unconscious signora who received it with palsied hand but with a thankful smile and a dim eye that looked on her with gratitude scarcely however had she taken off the fatal draught ere overcome by dreadful sickness she fell headlong from her seat she essayed to speak her sunken eyes rolled dreadfully and with violent convulsions she uttered i ami am poisoned she will not die muttered victoria in a low voice to the moor zofloya replied not but stooping over the struggling unfortunate he compressed her withered throat with his dark hand and the sounds halfformed rattled within it then rising with unruffled visage he laid his finger on his lip and pointing towards the castle precipitately disappeared victoria understood the movement neither shocked nor alarmed at the frightful outrage committed she ran from the recess and as she gained the castle called loudly for help servants immediately came running different ways and when informed that a terrible catastrophe had befallen the old signora they hastened to the spot even berenza conquered his pain and lassitude to gaze with awe upon the melancholy fate a forerunner only of his own the innocent lilla almost frantic exclaimed in agony as she leaned over the lifeless body of her only relative that she had now indeed no friend but was a deserted orphan left destitute in the world unkind lilla cried henriquez endeavouring to draw her from the painful scene have you not a lover and can you want a friend lilla replied not while tears of anguish coursed down her fair cheeks and melancholy forebodings filled her breast henriquez passed his arm round her waist and </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> and forced her from the spot while victoria gazed upon them as they passed with eyes of malignant rage every one believed that the old signora had expired suddenly in a fit some said the air had taken too powerful an effect on her debilitated frame some that she had been seized with sudden convulsion while even the wisest attributed the event to the visitation of providence and the infirmity of age that could no longer support the burden of existence none surmised the real cause at the dreadful scene of her death there were no witnesses but its cruel perpetrators in the gloomy solitariness of mutual guilt the deed was hatched and done a short time only had elapsed since the dreadful catastrophe of the poor signora during which victoria had continued though with pining reluctance the use of the slow poison the moor zofloya having peremptorily refused to administer as yet the final dose when frantic with protracted hope and increasing passion she sought again the dark abettor of her crimes it was on an evening when no appointment existed between them at an hour too much earlier than she had yet been accustomed to seek the moor but the demons of evil raged with such fury in her bosom that every consideration was lost in their overpowering influence the wretched berenza still lived an obstacle to her wishes and death death alone could satisfy her thirsting soul she bent her steps towards the thickest of the forest where the gloomy cypress tall pine and lofty poplar mingled in solemn umbrage beyond steep rocks seeming piled on one another inaccessible mountains with here and there a blasted oak upon its summit resembling rather from the distant point at which it was beheld a stunted shrub huge precipices down which the torrent dashed and foaming in the viewless abyss with mighty rage filled the most distant parts of the surrounding solitude with a mysterious murmuring produced by the multiplied reverberations of sound victoria stopped for a moment and gazed around the wild gloom seemed to suit the dark and ferocious passions of her soul she gave way to the chain of thought that came pressing on her mind her heart was anarchy and lust of crime and she regretted that she had suffered till now the existence of aught between her and her desired happiness by the daggers aid thought she i could have accomplished all ere now i despise yes despise my folly in having deliberated so long and the contemptible fears that have restrained my hand thus buoying herself up to frenzy she admitted no reflection of danger that was attendant on the open commission of crime her reason was blinded by the blandishments of guilt and the despotic sway of evil that triumphed in her heart soh zofloya zofloya she exclaimed with wild impatience why art thou not here thou perhaps and thou alone couldst soothe the burning madness of my brain as she concluded these words she struck her forehead violently with her hand and threw herself with her face upon the earth of a sudden the sweetest sounds stole upon her ear they were like the tremulous vibration of a doubletoned flute sounding as it were from a distance its lovely melody by turns softened and agitated her it seemed not the solemn notes of the organ from the neighbouring convent no it was unlike mortal harmony besides the convent was on the other side of the castle situated half way down a mighty rock and she had wandered too far to catch the smallest note of its deep sounding music even had the wind set towards the castle still the soft tones continued and kept her on the rack between pain and pleasure at one moment it brought before her view the idolized form of henriquez in all the grace of his youthful beauty disposing her to love and the most impetuous passion the next its melancholy cadence suggested to her sickening soul that him so franticly adored might never be hers and that the barriers existing between them could never be overcome if the turbulent emotions of her mind abated they gave place to others no less dangerous still she listened with resistless attention at length a slight pause occurred sweet arial sounds she cried yet painful are the impressions i receive from you distracting rather than soothing my troubled soul sooner yes sooner would i hear the footstep of zofloya or his sweet voice sweeter than all this music this voice then and not his step most beautiful signora said a voice which rivalled indeed the sweetness of the music and victoria beheld at her side the stately moor astonishing being she exclaimed i heard you not indeed whence came you i am here victoria will not that suffice show knew you that i desired your presence by sympathy lovely victoria your very thoughts have power to attract me such as you have just indulged would bring me to you from the further extremity of this terrestrial globe explain zofloya they are bold and spirited they convince me that you partake of myself and that you are worthy of my present devotion i am satisfied in this conviction but how have you the power of divining my thoughts zofloya smiled and regarded her with a piercing eye i can read them now beautiful victoria that highflushed cheek that wandering eye are evidences that cannot be mistaken victoria sighed deeply and concurring in the justice of the observation inquired no further the wily moor had turned her attention from his mysterious insinuations to her own conscious feelings these alone regained full possession of her and everything else appeared trivial in her view soh zofloya she exclaimed truly dost thou divine my soul is indeed disturbed and unless thou wilt assist me i am lost despair </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> despair not said the moor casting himself beside her as her figure half risen from the earth was supported by her elbow and her head reclined upon her hand despair not he repeated and repulsed took the hand which hung down say but how zofloya can serve his lovely mistress and let him prove to her his zeal hah thou knowest thou knowest zofloya she cried impatiently when looking upon the serious yet expressive countenance of the moor she more calmly proceeded i have hitherto zofloya yielded to thy counsel i may say to thy will for thou wouldst not grant me that which ere now would have set me free berenza still lives still intervenes between me and happiness well thou knowest the feverish suspense which i endure my blood bubbles in my heated veins and i feel within me as if the powers of life were withering scorched and dried up by the raging fires of my long protracted love oh kind and pitying moor i ask theeyes i ask thee for that which by ending at once the existence of him whose emaciated semblance of what he once was reproaches while it mocks my hopes shall free him from the lingering torments he endures and give new life to me she paused and looking on the moor beheld his eyes sparkling with such a scintillating brilliancy as it were that she was compelled to withdraw her gaze though impatiently she awaited his reply victoria said he at length in dulcet accents while the wild emotions of victorias bosom began already to subside i would not have thee think that in the waywardness of an unkind spirit i refused thee thy wish be assured thy present safety and the ultimate attainment of thy hopes alone actuated me when we essayed the poison on the ancient relative of the orphan lilla which speedily extinguished within her the feeble flame of life i ask thee would it have been expedient according to thy illjudged desire to have administered on the following day a similar draught to the conte what terrible and dangerous surmises would instantly have been excited marring thereby and putting perhaps an eternal period to all thy hopes it was necessary that a short time at least should elapse meanwhile we have not lost any for not a day hath since passed that has not brought him nearer to his grave because he still breathes and saintly lives thou believes that his breath and life are not nearly exhausted it is not so however and the slightest appellant will tumble him headlong into the arms of death had we not first essayed the efficacy of the poison upon the old signora but unadvisedly had administered it to him he would have languished for a time and his situation would have awakened suspicion now will i be sworn that success immediate success shall attend our attempt and that berenza shall die without power to express a word depend on me then lovely victoria place implicit confidence in zofloya hah if you are indeed anxious to serve me zofloya cried victoria with a smile that evidenced the joy imparted by the last words of the moor why did you not seek me at once and put the speediest possible end to my protracted misery i did not seek you because it increases my triumph and my pleasure that you should will me into your presence with joy do i promote your wishes but with redoubled joy when you yourself invite mebesides added he i am almost convinced that it would be as well even yet to delay for a time soh talk not to me so interrupted victoria wherefore wherefore delay the better to evade suspicion rejoined the moor soh you are bent upon destroying me zofloya when perceiving a gathering frown upon the countenance of the moor she hastily added soh frown not so terribly zofloya but assist me at once thereby laying claim to my eternal gratitude and enhancing the benefit you confer it shall be so then replied the moor with a beautiful but peculiar smile i will yield to your desire assist you in your attempt and shield you from all immediate consequences this night removes from your view one become so obnoxious to it this night saidst thou zofloya cried victoria in an exulting voice this very night returned the moor within this hour you shall see your desire fulfilled and i will preserve you from every danger and suspicion soh moor i thank thee exclaimed victoria seizing in her joy his hand and pressing it to her bosom the moor turned upon her his resplendent eyes his not that heart mine victoria said he in an impressive voice nit is indeed gratefully bound to you zofloya she answered looking upon him with a disconcerted air i say it is mine victoria returned he but he added smilingly fear not for i am not jealous of your passion for another victoria felt surprise she lifted her eyes to the countenance of the moor but they fell beneath his fiery glancesshe would have spoken she knew not what conflicting emotions chained her tongue she desired to reprove his boldness but needing his assistance she durst notshe beheld herself in his power and in the abjectness of her guilt she trembled zofloya smiled his hand had remained on her bosom its hard pressure seemed heavy on her heartshe now withdrew it and her confused senses began to rally she felt released as from a grasp of iron again she ventured to turn her eyes towards him his features had resumed their usual expression animated but serene resembling the returning brilliant calmness of a summer sky that had looked lurid with the threatened storm in an instant his ambiguous words vanished from the mind of victoria or ceased to make impression </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> impression aught was pardonable in the resistless zofloya and she faintly smiled victoria he observed nit is yet light the evening is mild and beautiful the breeze from the mountains bears temptation on its wings it promises delight to those in health and animation to the feeble berenza will i think be induced to venture forth leave this spot therefore walk towards the castle and you may encounter him if you do you will see me likewise should berenza be sick let your eyes seek me when mine meet yours put forth your hand and receive whatever i shall offer you give it to berenza and the result will be manifestedfarewell so saying in a moment he turned and walked rapidly away soon victoria beheld him no more his movement had been so precipitate so sudden that scarcely could she believe she had but just beheld him with slow and lingering steps she prepared however to depart the words of the moor still founded in her ears but their import was not clear to her his mysterious deportment occupied her thoughts and though in his presence hope and pleasant feelings diffused themselves through her bosom no sooner was he vanished than for the temporary calm she had experienced accumulated horrors distracted herthe wildest phrenzy of passion the most ungovernable hate and thirst even for the blood of all who might oppose her ina mind of such gloomy anarchy was she now traversing the forest her pace quick and irregular already had she entered the path leading to the castle when a faint and hollow voice uttered her name raising her eyes she started on beholding before her the hearttouching semblance of what he once had been the dying but unconscious berenza supported between lilla and henriquez his faded form was before her indeed but she beheld him not for her guilty eyes were directed instantly towards his blooming brother whose sparkling eye and healthanimated form presented too sure a striking contrast to the feeble being beside him sunk was the once brilliant eye and robbed of its red rose teint the pallid cheek of berenza despoiled of their healthful firmness his emaciated nerveless limbs his once expanded chest expanded now no longer but contracted and oppressed by a difficulty of respiration his elevated figure his step bold and erect now changed and depressed by the hard hand of long protracted suffering the wretched berenza retained about him no traces of what he once had been save in the sweet suavity of his unaltered manners save in the never dying grace that even in a state so pitiable accompanied his every movement the philosophic dignity of his soul his native strength of mind forsook him not but taught him as through life it had done to rise superior to his bodily illsills which even yet he vainly flattered himself were not irremediable in the delusive fondness of victorias eyes he still read hope from her wellfeigned solicitude he derived consolation and felt as though while beloved and attended by her death could not reach hither love her tenderness seemed to him a protecting shield through which its arrows could not pierce each pulsation of that faintly throbbing heart beat still with unvarying love for her and as he beheld her approaching he disengaged his arm from henriquez and hastening towards her even at the peril of sinking he leaned his trembling hand upon her shoulder for support and in an under voice he cried the hope of meeting thee my love hath enabled me to proceed thus far i now feel nearly overcome lead me wherefor a moment i my rest myself canst thou walk a few paces further inquired victoria leading him onwards to the very spot where the unfortunate signora had yielded up her life they were then at no great distance from it and berenza unable to reply motioned that he might be supported thither henriquez and lilla joined to assist him in a few minutes he gained the shady recess and reposed himself upon that seat that had already been so fatal to another passing then his arm around victoria he leaned his head upon her bosom you are much fatigued my love she observed in an anxious voice as she sat beside him eyes my victoria and i would i were at the castle for i faint with thirst what wouldst thou berenza i will hasten for it said victoria drink drink no matter what answered the miserable berenza something to revive my sinking soul soh my brother cried henriquez you drink more than is prudent and wine but increases the fever which consumes you what henriquez hastily and somewhat reproachfully cried the agitated berenza rendered irritable by long suffering i named not wine but if i had wouldst thou deprive me of every consolation refuse me every desire never before had the hapless berenza expressed himself thus to a brother whom he tenderly loved no sooner therefore did he observe that the feelings of henriquez were wounded than stretching forth his hand while a tear trembled in his eye he said forgive me brother forgive me you do not feel as i do nor would i have you without wine i am a wretch for while it quenches the intolerable thirst which seems to parch my vitals it warms and invigorates my debilitated frame it gives new life to my sinking spirits and renovates when they begin to fail my hopes of recovery here overcome by weakness he could only wave his hand which motion henriquez comprehending and vexed to have uttered aught that could in the smallest degree thwart his unfortunate brother cried fly my lilla to the castle and bring our brother some wine he may need my assistance here therefore i will remain the beauteous lilla bounded away to execute her mission berenza recovered a </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> a little but his heart beat quick though feebly and his frame trembled with an increase of debility lilla presently returned i met the moor zofloya she cried as she approached hand he hastens now towards us with wine i told him an overflowing goblet for you my lord she said with a sweet smile addressing berenza did you my little love said berenza faintly smiling in return for her innocent attention meantime with quick step zofloya drew near at sight of him violent emotion seized the breast of victoria now his last words began to be explained and she wondered in silence he approached and presented to the conte the goblet of wine which he carried give it to me my victoria cried berenza from thy hand would i receive it and with difficulty he raised his beating head from her bosom victoria stretched forth her hand for the wine her eyes met those of zofloya they were pregnant with terrible intelligence for they spoke that death was in the goblet which she received from his hand with all her shrinking hardihood in deeds of horror the strange the dreadful expression of zofloyas countenance shook her inmost soul nerving her hand however she took with assumed steadiness the fatal glass and presented it to the anxious berenza he raised it fixing his hollow eyes upon her countenance and then looking up to heaven as if to call down blessings on her head he raised it to his lips and hastily drank its contents even to the dregs scarce had he done so ere with convulsive motion his hand was pressed upon his heart that heart seized with an acute and sudden pang yet he uttered not a word for while the fires of etna consumed his vitals respiration was nearly arrested and he gaspedhis lips and cheeks became deadly pale his eyes closed his hands fell nerveless beside him and bereft of sense he sunk back who more collected than the dark zofloya he loosed the vest of the conte he rubbed his hands and his temples and while horror assailed henriquez and even the guilty victoria felt a selfish terror at the sudden accomplishment of her own wishes he calmly though with seeming sorrow expressed his idea that the conte had fainted through excessive weakness and would probably recover if conveyed into the castle where proper remedies could be administered to this remark henriquez though almost insensible from alarm sadly assented the moor then raising in his brawny arms him whom he well knew would nevermore revive hastened with him into the house the lifeless berenza being laid upon a couch a favorite servant of the contes by name antonio proposed instantly to go in search of a certain monk belonging to the neighbouring convent who was reported to be highly skilled in physic and the disorders of the human frame henriquez catching at the idea hastily dispatched him with every promise of reward if he used expedition and meantime approaching his brother assisted victoria and her wily coadjutor in their pretended endeavours to restore him that every effort was vain is scarcely necessary to be said yet great was the trepidation of victoria left the reputed skill of the monk if it failed in counteracting the deadly effects of the poison should at least reveal to him that poison had been resorted to this idea threw her into a state of terror that not all her dependence on zofloya nor even the offended glances of encouragement which from time to time he cast on her could subdue after some time of excruciating anxiety passed by all though from different motives antonio at length returned he was accompanied by a monk indeed but not by him whom he sought the reverend father being absent from the convent on visits of charity in a distant hamlet the one now with him was offered as his substitute and highly recommended by the superior as second at least to father anselmo in physical knowledge and his equal in piety charity and goodwill towards men the monk approached berenza and after looking at him a few moments desired that his arm might be uncovered then taking his lancet from his pocket he made a small puncture in the vein victoria bent over him with wellfeigned sorrow while henriquez held his motionless hand suddenly though at the first puncture a single drop had refused to flow the blood started forth and slew in the face of victoria terror and surprise nearly overpowered the conscience stricken wife the avenging blood of berenza had fixed upon his murderer and hung its flaming evidence upon her cheek she dared not lift her eyes left those of others should read in them the selfwritten characters of guilt but with trembling hand raising a handkerchief to her face wiped away the crimson stains and then again ventured to bend over his lifeless form still in terrible expectation of some further fearful event all was over however the blood had just started and instantly ceased animation was not suspended merelyit was for ever fled no one suspecting her guilt her agitation was attributed only to the acutely painful feelings natural to be excited by an occurrence so affecting while the thoughts and observation of all were still engaged upon berenza she ventured to raise her eyes the terrible eyes of zofloya alone encountered hers in them she read the desperate and gloomy fierceness of determined crime she could not gaze upon them but hastily looked away though despairing of the smallest success the monk had opened a vein in the other arm of berenza the terrors of victoria were renewed but groundlessly no lifewarm current followed the lancets point the heart was for ever motionless and the bosom in which once it had beat high in healthful pride inanimate and cold hope </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> hope could no more be indulgedfor no swoon but the eternal sleep of death was discovered to have seized berenza such a fate so sudden so terrible for the best of human beings excited bitter grief in the minds of all but victoria yet even those who lamented him most felt no surprise for though immediate death had not been foreseen no one had ventured to hope that it was far distant he had not expired in the plenitude of vigorous health his decay on the contrary had been progressive though rapid and his dissolution hastened as henriquez believed by the unhappy determination of his beloved brother to refuse all medical advice in the strange delusive persuasion of his everreasoning mind that nature must be allsufficient to triumph in time over her own complaints never in despite of representations most delicately urged would berenza give ear to any suggestions of actual danger and for this pertinacity henriquez too justly in his mind arraigned victoria so tenderly beloved by the conte and often had he felt surprise and indignation that she never joined with others in entreating him to alter his fallacious system when she well knew that her word or slightest persuasion would have changed instantly his most obstinate resolve on the contrary she would often argue with him that physicians were ignorant dangerous experimentalists and pretend to be herself a convert to the hazardous plan of trusting all to the operations of nature in consequence of these reflections the heart of henriquez involuntarily turned against the infamous wife he had never viewed her with sentiments of regard and she was now more than unpleasing in his sight from an unaccountable combination of ideas he connected her so intimately with the cause of berenzas death by having upheld him in his mistaken notions that he shrunk almost instinctively from her with a sentiment of horror unhappy brother little didst thou surmise how well how justly founded were the feelings of thy breast wherein nature so powerfully asserted herself when at a late hour the inmates of the mansion that so late had owned berenza for its lord retired to their respective apartments more to indulge in solitude their grief for his loss than to seek repose it chanced that victoria whom no feeling however of regret or remorse for the cruel death inflicted by her on the most excellent of human beings deprived of the power to sleep awakened soon after she retired to bed from a disturbed and terrifying dream starting up in her bed she gazed around the chamber still trembling under its dreadful impression she thought that entering the apartment where the corpse of the deceased conte reposed she had drawn aside the curtains of the bed and beheld his countenance and various parts of his body discoloured and disfigured by livid marks evidences of the poison which had been given him that in the frenzy of despair and terror she had called upon and reproached zofloya who without deigning to reply gazed upon her with a stern and bitter smile thus in a state of mind baffling description she had awakened and the impression made by her dream was so strong that although she endeavoured to view it only as an insignificant vision caused by the events of the day she found it impossible to compose herself the figure of berenza discoloured by the effects of the poison still swam in her view at length determined to end what she conceived to be her superstitious terrors she resolved to seek the apartment of the conte and to satisfy herself with the conviction that her dream was without foundation phantoms conjured merely by a diseased imagination accordingly rising from bed she wrapped herself in a loose white dress and took in her hand a lamp which was burning on a marble table at the other end of the room as she quitted her chamber it occurred to her that zofloya had said he would shield her from suspicion he might mean only with respect to having caused the death of the conte he had not expressly said that after his death it should not be possible to ascertain by what means it had been occasioned this reflection accelerated her steps and with pallid cheek and beating heart she reached the room where in awful solitary stillness reposed the body of the conte pausing trembling at every step dreading to discover she knew not what slowly she approached the bed whereon he lay the curtains which were of cause were drawn close around still hesitating without she endeavoured to look through them but the outline only of the poor berenzas form was discernible as seen through a thin mist summoning resolution then she drew the curtains apart a slight covering still lightly veiled his countenance desperate fierce she snatched it away when horrible confirmation of her fears she beheld the features disfigured indeed and frightfully changed even to the most extravagant portraiture of her distempered fancy for a few moments she remained rooted to the spot then resistlessly impelled to search for and know the worst at once however it might increase her consternation and despair she opened his peaceful unconscious bosom whereon large spots of livid green and blue became revealed and struck her almost senseless with overpowering dread no the dread of public justice so much as the dread horrible to her that the discovery or suspicion of her guilt would prevent before death the accomplishment of her criminal wishes rendering thereby useless and unavailing the enormities she had atchieved for their sake these ideas glanced rapidly through her mind she still remained by the side of the bed gazing upon the placid though discoloured features of him she had destroyed and which had she been susceptible of compunctious feeling spoke in their mournful fixedness a thousand reproaches on </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> on her guilt but no her thoughts were employed upon the consequences likely to ensue to herself the hour of morning began to approach and her heart beat with increased alarm at the idea of the surmises that must soon be excited by the altered appearance of the conte the terrible inquisition its horrid torments its lynxeyed scrutiny pressed upon her brainat this juncture she thought of zofloya a faint hope that he might assist her in the present confusion of her ideas determined her to apply to himyet how to seek him and at this hour how could she to the presumptuous moor excuse the indecorum of summoning him these reflections unworthy however the masculine spirit of a victoria she speedily overcame in the stronger sense of her embarrassment and she decided to seek him instantly she knew that his apartment was situated near that of henriquez and cautiously she left the silent chamber of death and retraced her steps along the darksome gallery dimly illumined only by the lamp she held and which served to guide her steps as she was slowly proceeding a ray from her lamp fell suddenly upon the sparkling vest of zofloya and partially betrayed his towering figure to her view i was seeking you i need your advice hasten onwards i pray in a low voice entreated victoria too rejoiced to have encountered him to feel surprise at his unexpected appearance lead on then replied the moor i am obedient victoria laid her finger on her lip and turned back towards the chamber of the conte the contrast between them as they moved along was peculiarly forcible the figure of victoria slender and elegantly proportioned arrayed in flowing white with her raven hair streaming over her shoulders that of zofloya so gigantic and differently attired yet seeming at intervals by the dubious rays of the lamp and the effect of strong shade increased to a height scarcely human once or twice the deceptive magnitude of his dark shadow on the wall struck with momentary alarm even the hardy victoria and might have excited remark but that other objects engrossed too deeply her present thoughts they now reached the peaceful gloomy chamber of berenza enter zofloya whispered victoria and approach that bed the moor obeyed open the curtains and gaze upon the countenance within the moor opened the curtains and looked upon the face of berenza then turning immediately to victoria the expression of his features though less malignant and severe reminded her forcibly of her dream tell me moor she exclaimed rendered desperate by her feelings of terror and grasping with violence the arm of zofloya tell me what can be done in this terrible extremity the moor was silent didst thou not tell me pursued victoria thou wouldst preserve me from suspicion behold those blackened features that discoloured bosom who can sail immediately to ascertain that poison poison hath caused the death of berenza whoever beholds the conte will clearly ascertain that fact coolly replied the moor zofloya zofloya cried victoria gasping with terror what is that you say i say beautiful victoria whoever sees the conte will instantly pronounce that his death was caused by poison victoria clasped her hands and remained mute with consternation and anguish fixing her regards upon the moor victoria he cried at length if you would have my services i repeat what i have often urged you must place implicit confidence in me and firm reliance retire now to your chamber and fear nothing for the morrow but berenza leave to me all care for your safety but those marks the moor knit his dark brows i have said he cried in a stern authoritative voice and pointed haughtily to the door the frame of victoria trembled and she retreated towards the door horror and awe at the inexplicable character of the moor so wholly possessed her that though she longed she durst not require an explanation of his intentions with respect to the body of berenza his dark but brilliant eyes like two stars ina gloomy cloud pursued her with their strong imperious rays even to the threshold of the door she flopped hesitated and attempted to speak but the effort was vain and without power to offer resistance she quitted the apartment great alternately were the terrors and great the hopes of victoria on the word of the moor she had strong reliance for she had never yet found that he deceived her but his ambiguous promises his explicit acknowledgment that whoever saw the body of the conte must discover the occasion of his death threw her again into fits of doubt and consternation and the hours that she passed in her chamber expecting every moment some confirmation of her fears were the just portion of one immersed like herself in blackest guilt the morning was not far advanced when a mingled commotion and confusion of voices pervaded the castle the terrors of conscious criminality prevented her from rising to inquire the cause fainting almost dying she awaited the result while cold drops of agony gemmed her writhing brow at length a loud knocking at her chamber door caused her to start from her seat the blood flew into her lately pallid cheeks and as suddenly rushed back to her heart leaving them again of a livid paleness the knocking continued more dead than alive she tottered to the door and opened it various persons domestics in the castle burst into the room strong dismay painted on their faces and with loud lamentation exclaimed that the body of the conte was missing this dreadful and singular event spread consternation throughout the castle victoria alone could have attempted to explain it and she carefully treasured in her bosom the ideas that presented themselves soh most exquisite zofloya exclaimed she in the solitude of her chamber well lightest thou </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> thou say that those who beheld the body of the conte would be enabled to ascertain the cause of his death while already thou hadst resolved that it should never more be seen noi will doubt thee no longer powerful moor nor thy care for my safety for well do i now perceive thy infinite depth and wisdom but after the first emotions of joy at her narrow escape had subsided she began to marvel and reflect upon the sudden and precipitate disappearance of the body whither in that short space could he have conveyed it perhaps into some bottomless abyss where the foaming torrent had embraced and hid it ever moreif not sohow then had he disposed of itno matter how so that never more it revisited the light adieu then for the present to vain and useless surmises thought she i will rest content with the effect that has been produced events however terrible and strange at the moment of their occurrence lose by degrees their impression over the mind for the ideas failing to identify the point at which they aim relax their attempts and revert to the consideration of objects more familiar to themthus after a certain lapse of time though surprize and regret continued frequently to obtrude on the minds of all strong anxiety and horror gradually tho slowly diminisheda gloomy calm was perceptible throughout the house as though every one bore about him the memory of some dreadful calamity which time had ameliorated into a chastened grief on the heart of henriquez had the melancholy death of his brother and its accompanying circumstances sunk the deepestthe castle where so late he had resided became a gloomy memento in his sight and the presence of victoria daily and unaccountably more displeasing to himhe meditated therefore to abandon the former and to quit italy altogether for some distant clime where the memory of his misfortunes should no more in a thousand eloquent and mournful shapes continue to haunt him the time however was now fast approaching when the innocent lilla would no longer consider it a point of religion or duty to hesitate at becoming his wifetill this period therefore he decided to remain stationary to smother the repugnant feelings of his bosom for he reflected that unless he remained under the same roof with victoria he should be debarred the society of his lilla well knowing that her unaffected virtue and sense of decorum would deem it improper to be elsewhere so perpetually with him mean time the passion of victoria having now as she conceived no further obstacles to surmount grew to an unrestrained heightshe sought by every wily blandishment and seduction to attract the attention of henriquezbut vain were her artifices for his soul was enslaved by the simplicity and innocence of the youthful lilla all other women were detestable in his sighther trembling delicacy her gentle sweetness her sylphlike fragile form were to him incomparable an being familiarized to the observance of such soft loveliness the rest of her sex when placed beside her appeared in his idea like beings of a different order but above all victoria he viewed with almost absolute dislikeher strong though noble features her dignified carriage her authoritative together boldness her insensibility her violence all struck him with instinctive horror so utterly opposite to the gentle lilla that when with an assumed softness she deigned to caress her he almost trembled for her tender life and compared the picture in his mind to the snowy dove fondled by the ravenous vulture at length with infinite reluctance and to the bitter mortification of her pride victoria acknowledged to herself that she was not only indifferent to henriquez but despised and hated by himat this bitter conviction her brain whirled eyes he detests me she exclaimed in an agony of ragebut he shall he must be minehis boyish caprice shall nought avail himah she continued relapsing into softnessi will throw myself my fortune into his armsi will again sacrifice my liberty and offer to become his wife amidst these reflections the haughty victoria had scarce allowed herself to believe that the attachment of henriquez to lilla was the cause of his indifference to hershe resolved to be at once explicit thereforeto make to henriquez a proposal which she imagined he would not dream of refusing and to seize the earliest opportunity of doing so as if to coincide with her views lilla on the same evening complaining of indisposition retired early and henriquez who felt no desire to remain alone with a woman whom he viewed with sentiments of disgust arose a few moments after lilla had quitted the apartment and bowing distantly to victoria was departing stay henriquez cried the detertermined victoria starting from her seat i desire a few words with you henriquez bowed and arrested his steps be seated implore you have you any thing material to communicate signora inquired henriquez unable to conceal his reluctance to her societyor will not tomorrow answer equally well no replied victoria in an impressive accent i request you henriquez to be seated unwillingly henriquez resumed his seat when the frantic woman incapable of restraining her emotion cast herself at his feet and seizing his handhenriquez she cried henriquez my soul adores youbehold me at your feeti offer you allall that i possessing hand in marriagegrant me but your love signora answered henriquez with assumed composure disengaging himself from her graspas my brothers wise i tolerated but never approved yousince his death my feelings towards you have acquired a stronger casti now he cried forgetting in a moment his attempt at coolnessi now hate and despise youwretch worthless and insensible as you are to forget so soon a husband that adored you and doubly a wretch to confess to me your unhallowed thoughts whose soul you know to be irrevocably anothers victoria sprang </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> sprang from her abject posture the feelings which swayed her heart had been irrepressible she had not intended to be thus premature in her avowal of love but the violence of passion threw her off her guardnow the emotions excited by the reply of henriquez were equally unconquerable miserable youth she criedit is enoughyour insulting coolness your bitter reproaches i could have bornehave borne proud as i am with patience but that you should dare without trembling to acknowledge in my presence your love for another love interrupted henriquez with enthusiasmlovesay adoration idolatryby heaven my lilla is a gem too bright to shed her pure rays beneath this contaminated roofoh wretched victoria he continued with a bitter smile hand could you attempt to talk of love to the lover of villae can language describe the feelings of victoria her brain worked with wildest rage producing almost instant madness yet revenge thirsting revenge was the predominant sensation of her soul swallowing up every otherby an effort and selfcommand scarcely credible she reined in the tumult of her passion and forbore to recriminate upon henriquez what drive him from the castle and lose thereby the power of sacrificing the abhorred lilla to her vengeance the pigmy the immaterial speck that she had deemed unworthy of a thought to lose too for ever the possibility of softening perhaps even yet subduing the stern insensibility of henriquezno the sacrifice to frantic rage would have been too greather decision was prompt and instantaneouscovering her face with her hands she sunk into a chair and audibly sobbed a reply so different to what he had taught himself to expect knowing the violence of her nature at once surprised and affected henriquezin a moment he regretted the asperity with which he had spoken and the reflection obtruded on his mind that the female whose only fault towards him was the love which she bore him merited at least a milder return he hesitated an instantthe goodness of his heart prevailed and he approached the wily victoria i would offer signora in a gentle voice he said taking her hand some apology for my warmth meant noti assure you i meant not to be severewill you then he added pardon me and accept this acknowledgement of my error soh henriquez replied victoria redoubling her tears nit is i alone who am in fault at this moment i feel within me the reproaches due to my conduct the words which i have suffered to escape my lips now strike me with shame and horrorscarcely can i account for the impulse that forced me to give them utterance noble and generous as you are forget if you possibly can the phrenzy of the moment and do notdo not she pursued casting herself again at his feet despise me to the degree that i feel you ought henriquez infinitely affected raised in his arms her whom he believed was indeed the abashed and repentant victoria he besought her to be composed and to forgive him the pain that he had caused her hah all that i ask is your forgiveness said victoria hand your promise that you will not reflect upon what has passed this night to my disadvantage oh henriquez i will shew you that if victoria yields for a moment to an unpardonable weakness that she knows how to conquer and become herself again henriquez assured her that he would blot from his mind every impression unfavourable to her and added that by the immediate revival of noble sentiments in her bosom and the candour with which she had arraigned herself she had more than expiated the imperfect part of her conduct victoria affecting to be satisfied and grateful for this assurance took with wellfeigned diffidence and humility the hand of henriquez and raising it to her lips turned from him as if unable to restrain her emotion and hurried out of the room reaching her own apartment the miserable because guilty victoria threw herself upon her bed in torture too great to be described the most infuriate passions forcibly restrained as they had been in the presence of henriquez now agitated her breast and now found vent in terrible imprecations she cursed herself the hour that gave her being and the mother that had borne her outraged pride swelled her heart to bursting and its insatiable fury called aloud for vengeance for blood and the blood of the innocent lilla soh let me at once destroy the minion she wildly exclaimed starting from the bed and snatching from her bosom a dagger which she usually carried there let me at once i say destroy the puny wretch who dares to call destruction on her head by thus becoming of consequence not yet victoria said a melodious voice and before her stood the moor who gently seized her uplifted arm and smiled show came you hither zofloya she criedyour voice nor your smile nor your promises have power to calm me now beautiful victoria he answered i come to counsel and to sooth thou canst do neither moor for henriquez hates mecanst thou change the genuine sentiments of the heart canst thou of hatred make love i can do much victoria if you will confide in me but thou art not a sorcerer nit is possible to have a knowledge of physic and yet not be a physician soh yes thou hast infinite knowledge zofloyaevery day proves it beyond doubtbut thou canst notno thou canst not charm love for me into the heart that loves another not readily while that other intervenes fair victoria canst thou assist mesay at once canst thou assist me zofloya lovely victoria the silver tones of the moor penetrated to the very heart of victoria his wily accent was piteously tender tears spontaneous tears rushed into her eyes and involuntarily she threw herself into his arms which </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> which opened to receive her and wept upon his bosom zofloya gently pressed her in his arms the delusion of victoria continued buta few moments she hastily disengaged herself from his embrace and hesitatingly said tis strange zofloyai know not why but thou soothes me ever and attracted me irresistiblyi do indeed believe she added with an earnest smile that thou art truly a sorcerer the moor smiled also and bent as in acknowledgment his graceful form fascination dwelt in every movement of this singular being and in nothing was it more evinced than in the power he held over the proud heart of victoria incomparable and lovely mistress he cried falling upon one knee and laying his hand upon his heart deign to inform the most lowly of your slaves what you would require of him and having said trust to him for the performance rise then zofloya cried victoria flattered and delighted by a condescension of late somewhat unusual with the moor rise and tell menai canst thou not divine zofloyalillalilla the orphan lilla stands between you and your loveis it not so eyes yes hand you would have her die cried victoria relapsing into phrenzy calm calm in gentle accents said the moorthe orphan lilla must not die signora no nofor it would excite instant suspicion and then farewell to all your hopesyou forget fair victoria that already true true hastily returned victoria but what then nit must not be soh madnessit shall it must without your aid then zofloya looked sternbe it so then signora he cried and moved with dignity towards the door soh stay inconsistent being cried victoria hand forgive my despair despairdespair when i have bid you hopeyou must confide soh be at once explicit and tell me well then lilla must not die but she shall be at your disposal and you may inflict on her such misery that such torments interrupted victoria with demoniac sparkling eyesyes such torments as shall pay for those she has inflicted upon mebut when oh when zofloya may this be nat tomorrows dawn be in the forest proceed through the narrow break on your left ascend the steep rock which overlooks the wood making it appear an inconsiderable dell and when you have gained the summit remain and await my coming i will be punctualbut lilla she shall be with meenquire no further victoria joy and abominable triumph filled the breast of victoria well was she now versed and well could decipher the ambiguous answers of the moor zofloya she cried in a voice of exultation excellent zofloya say how can i repay you and eagerly taking a brilliant of immense value from her finger she added accept this and wear it for my sake but wear it concealed in your bosom with a proud and dignified air zofloya put back with his hand the offered gift keep your diamond signora the riches of the world are valueless to me my aim is higher hand what is it you aim at then zofloya your friendshipyour trustyour confidenceyourself signora victoria smiled at what she thought the gallantry of the moor the moor smiled likewise but with a different air and bowing respectfully to victoria as he advanced towards the door he said farewell signora for the present watch for the first streak of the morning sleep shall not visit my eyes i will gaze upon the firmament and at the last fading of the stars will leave my chamber the moor waved gracefully his hand and retired no sooner was he gone than victoria extinguished the lamp that no artificial light might render unobserved the first approach of dawn then opening the window she seated herself beside it and gazed with unblushing front upon the serene majesty of the cloudless heavens patiently did she endure the loss of sleep patiently attend like the bloodthirsty murderer who rendered invulnerable to external ills by the strong nerved fierceness of his mind lurks ambushed through the lonely night for the unconscious footstep of his destined victim so did she wake so watch anticipating alternately the gratification of her revenge and scenes of future bliss with the beloved henriquez compelled at length with bitter reluctance to view the blooming lilla as the powerful shield presumptuously opposed to her fascinations she determined while pride and hatred nerved anew her heart to inflict upon the innocent girl all that malice or that vengeance could invent meanwhile henriquez being left to the solitude of his reflection reviewed the conduct of victoria he began to fear he had ultimately treated her with too great lenity and forbearance disgust rose in his soul against her he compared to her shameless and dishonorable confession the blushing sweetness the retiring modesty of the young orphan lilla ardently he longed for the hour in which with propriety he could withdraw her from the tainted roof under which still rich in native purity she continued to breathe joy and complacent delight diffused itself through his bosom when he reflected that a few days only need now elapse ere the pious scruples of his innocent love would be at an end he might then call her legally and for ever his the probationary year was nearly expired he resolved in the moment of its completion to claim her for his bride and depart not only from the spot where he had lost an only and idolized brother but from his native land forever the very atmosphere of which had now become obnoxious to him now his mind wandered into anticipated scenes of happiness he beheld himself the father of a blooming progeny the delighted husband of a beauteous wife and regret passed through his mind when he reflected that his lost berenza would never make one among the blissful group enjoying a felicity he would have delighted to contemplate ah miserable henriquez little didst </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> didst thou dream that these thy fairy visions of love and happiness were never never to be realised but to end on the contrary in reduplicated horror and despair victoria remained sitting at the window immersed in gloomy meditation till the opening horizon began to shew faint streaks of light between clouds of darker hue and the blue mists of the distant waters slowly to dissipate the stars became fainter and a fresher breeze was wasted from the east when intent on evil she stole with cautious footsteps from her chamber now with beating heart she gained the court and passed into the forest hastening onwards to the path described by zofloya the deep gloom rendered almost impervious the lonely way and the break on the left to which he had alluded she ascertained it however and as she proceeded a deeper gloom informed her that she approached the frowning rock which cast its dark shadow aroundthough never before had she wandered in the light of day so far she trusted implicitly to the directions of zofloya and prepared to ascend the rocky acclivity morning gradually advanced but surrounding objects were still rendered indistinct by a delusive mistshe proceeded a considerable way up the rock when the loud solemn roar of the foaming cataract dashing from a fissure on the opposite side into the precipice beneath broke upon her earshe fearlessly advanced however till she gained the summit while louder and more stunning became the angry sound of the waters here for a while she decided to remain the dim light even yet afforded no correct view over the lengthened rock mountains of mist appeared rising above each other till the last ridge dimly stretched its gigantic outline upon the distant horizon shewing no world beyond the stars had all retired as though shrinking abashed from the view of so much guilt but louring clouds obscured the face of heaven the wind sighed hollow among the trees of the forest and though the lonely solemn grandeur of the scene would have inspired in the breast of virtue deep awe and devotion directing the soul to inward contemplation yet was it sad and unwelcome to the evil mind which bearing within itself an eternal night feels troubled and appalled in the gloom of nature such was the state of victoriarestless and impatient for the encreasing lightencreasing light came on she arose from the spot where she had seated herself and gazed around on one side the yet shadeenveloped forest seeming as zofloya had said an inconsiderable dell appeared far beneath her feet while on the other a dark blue line of mist gave distant warning of the skygirt ocean that in oblique ascent seemed blending with the heavens the rock on which she stood being an elevated point had caught the first light of the morning and to herself she was fully revealed objects below were still partially gloomed and eagerly she strained her anxious eyes to catch the first glimpse of what alone could interest her attention every moment which elapsed appeared to her sanguinary soul like so much time robbed her of her revenge but at length to her infinite joy the sight so ardently desired greeted her view hastening onwards with rapid strides along the winding path she had so lately traversed she beheld the gigantic figure of the moor gigantic even from the diminishing points of heighth and distancehanging lifeless over his shoulder encircled by his nervous arms he bore the once blooming lillablooming now no longer but paler than the white rose teint swiftly he approached and careless of his burthen bounded like lightning up the rugged rockvictoria contemplated with joyous exultation the helpless and devoted orphanher fragile form lay nerveless her snowwhite arms bare nearly to the shoulder for a thin lightness alone covered her hung down over the back of the moor her feet and legs resembling sculptured alabaster were likewise bare her languid head drooped insensible while the long flaxen tresses escaping from the net which had enveloped them now partly shaded her ashy cheek and now streamed in dishevelled luxuriance on the breeze shall we hurl her down the precipice cried victoria while her fierce and jealous eyes wandered over the betrayed graces of her spotless victim no said zofloya follow me he darted down a rugged path on the opposite side of the rock and though not with equal swiftness victoria pursued his steps now he hovered on the edge of a precipice now ascended a mountainous steep at length in a narrow valley or rather rocky division between two mountains of gigantic heighth he paused for a moment an irregular winding path forming a steep declivity seemed leading almost to a bottomless abyss zofloya looking at victoria observed that she was nearly exhausted with violent exertion to keep him in view have courage he cried but a few steps further victoria endeavoured to smile and followed him with new alacrity for the base passions of her soul stung her with a desperate firmness suddenly zofloya stopped he laid his still inanimate burthen upon the rugged path and with apparent ease though it seemed to require superhuman strength removed what had appeared a projecting point of rock but which victoria now perceived to be only a huge and independent fragment of ita deep narrow opening presented itself beneath the moor raising lilla again in his arms entered the aperture with an inclination of the bodyvictoria still followed and soon beheld herself in a spacious cavern gloomily enlightened alone by the opening at which they had entered there victoria cried the moor your rival may be at least secured from the possibility of further molesting you now if the heart of henriquez be vincible there is nothing to impede your happiness but answered victoria with a gloomy air while lilla lives is there not a </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> a remote possibility that she might escape hence behold then said the moor what shall ever remove that vain fear lifting from the floor of the cavern as he spoke a massy chain which though fixed to the opposite side of the wall extended in length to the sloping irregular ascent leading to the mouth of the aperture with this ring at the extremity he pursued while the girl is still insensible i will fasten it round her wrist will you then victoria be satisfied i will endeavor hesitatingly replied victoria still desiring nothing less than the death of one whose beauty was blasting to her sight nit shall be done then said zofloya though wholly unnecessary for when she returns to the power of thought how will she be enabled to divine the true situation of the spot in which she will find herself she will even be ignorant of the means by which she came hitheras when she awakened and found me bearing her from her bedfor deep in sleep as she was and smiling at her dreams of love no doubt i seized her in my arms to fulfil my promise to youthen vainly struggling within my grasp she fainted and has since remained insensiblehow then unassisted incredulous fearful victoria could she trace out a path which she had not even power to observe further precautions than leaving her here are be assured unnecessary still i would wish the chain muttered victoriaif unnecessary as a precaution it may have its advantage as a punishment come hasten good zofloya she continued putting in his hand the fair and lifeless hand of lillalet us depart from hence before our absence is discovered zofloya smiling with a scornful archness retained the hand of lilla in one hand and holding the chain in the other while he looked upon it said to her in a jeering accent think you victoria that il consilio di deici hath ever confined any of its victims in a spot so remote as this cavern this ring this massy chain seem almost an evidence that at that terrible name the colour of victoria forsook her cheek cruel and ill timed remark she cried interrupting the moor in his malicious insinuationwhy at this moment allude to subjects irrelevanti pray you fasten the chain and let us go still with the smile upon his countenance he prepared to obey the desire of the terror struck victoriain a moment the galling chain was clasped around the delicate wrist of lilla and victoria hastening towards the aperture exclaimed let us now leave this placecome zofloya and precede me hence suffering the devoted orphan to remain stretched upon the flinty ground both now prepared to quit the cavernalready they had gained the ascent when at that moment the miserable lilla opened her eyes without being fully restored to sense she perceived with dismay her situation she essayed to speak but could not and starting up cast herself despairingly upon her knees raising her innocent hands in agonized supplication the motion and noise of the chain caused victoria to turn her headache beheld the kneeling defenceless orphanbut she saw only her rival and pausing while a smile of exulting malice passed over her features she waved her hand as in derision and instantly hastened on as she gained the mouth of the aperture and retreated from the sight of the wretched girl who with horror had recognized victoria a shrill and piercing scream assailed her ears but failed to excite in her breast one emotion of pity for the state in which she had abandoned her signora observed zofloya as again they took their path across the mountains nit is my intention to return hither in the course of this day with provisions for our prisoner and a mantle of leopard skin which i possess to serve her at once for bed and coverings likewise intend methinks you are tender of the upstart angrily interrupted victoria nit is not my intention coolly returned the moor that the death of your rival should be caused by famine she shall have food therefore for in the spot where she is doomed to breathe the residue of her days her dissolution will be accelerated in sufficient time why there is certainly a pleasure with a fierce malignant smile observed victoria hin the infliction of prolonged torment i therefore approve your arrangement you will sometimes visit the young girl signora will you not nit will be an exquisite delight that i shall occasionally confer on myself she replied but if henriquez prove unkind she shall have no reason to thank me for my visit a just and excellent combination signora satirically remarked the moor if henriquez prove unkind she deservedly suffers whose memory is the cause indeed i admire that inflexible spirit you possess signorathat unyielding soul whose thirsty vengeance is never satiated victoria turned her looks upon the moor to read if he spoke earnestlyand she rejoiced to behold in the lambent fire of his ardent eyes relentless cruelty and mischievous delight as he had uttered the last words the morning was now far advanced but no beams of the chearing sun irradiated the heavenslight hovering clouds overspread with gloom the deep recesses of the forest upon which they almost appeared to descendall was awful stillness not even the carol of a bird broke upon the solemn silence as though the eye of morning paused in grief upon the crimes that had ushered in its dawn the moor spoke not and victoria absorbed in calculations of the conduct most eligible to be pursued for the attainment of her wishes sought not to draw him into converse in this manner they proceeded till they gained the open forest when zofloya observed it would be expedient to separate before they came in view of the castle victoria acquiesced in the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> the propriety of the ideashe hastened towards the castle and he struck into an opposite direction henriquez awakened in the fond hope of beholding her whose lovely image had visited him in his dreams he hastened to a certain part of the wood the most open and chearful where as frequent he expected to find her for lilla sometimes inhaled the pure breeze from the mountains at an early hour of the morning for some time he traversed this favorite spot with patience conceiving it possible that yielding longer than usual to sleep she had not yet arisen yet the morning was already so far advanced that every moment rendered this idea more improbable he determined therefore to return into the housestill he beheld no sign of her his soul adored impatiently he summoned a female servant and ordered her to repair to the chamber of the signora lilla to awaken her and inform her of the lateness of the hour what alarm then must have seized him when the servant returning informed him that the bed of the young signora was vacant and appeared to have been so for some time but that her clothes remained upon the chair beside it where they seemed to have been cast on the preceding night henriquez naturally impetuous made no remark but springing from his seat rushed past the servant and flew wildly into her chamber where sailing indeed to behold her with frantic impatience he searched every part of the castle that was habitable it is needless to say in vain regardless at length of every thing but his lost love the door of victorias chamber meeting his view he burst it with the strength of madness open and rushed into her apartment the artful victoria fully prepared for the scene she expected to ensue had retired to her bed on returning from the dreadful deed of the early morning and as henriquez forced himself into her chamber appeared to start up alarmed as if suddenly aroused from a peaceful slumber henriquez regardless of her seeming terror or surprise flew towards the bed scarce knowing what he did and seizing her by the arm exclaimed in frantic voice my lilla is missingtell me tell me i implore thee where she is illa missing answered victoria with assumed surpriseimpossible signor but observing the air with which henriquez regarded her she added yet if it be so would i could indeed inform you where to seek her soh i shall die mad with agony cried henriquez if my lilla be not found retire a moment then signor henriquez in sympathising accents said victoria i will arise and dress myself and together we will seek our beloved little friend perceiving the despair and anguish of henriquez painted in his eyes she continued be pacified i entreat you and rest assured the fair girl cannot be far distant henriquez striking his hand upon his forehead darted out of the room and victoria hastily rising and dressing herself followed him into the apartment where they usually assembled she proposed to the distracted lover that they should seek lilla together again every corner of the castle was searched again the forest was inspected and resounded to the name of lilla in vain in voice of agony henriquez called upon that name the lovely innocent naked chained and solitary was far far beyond the possibility of replying once more they now entered her chamber the clothes she had worn on the preceding day remained untouched upon the spot where she appeared upon taking them off to have cast them the bedclothes seemed dragged on one side and lay partly upon the floor in one place the curtains were twisted and torn and the net which was supposed to have encircled her head at night lay likewise upon the ground near the door as though it had fallen off upon this more accurate examination the despair of henriquez knew no bounds it appeared as if his innocent love had been torn defenceless from her bed the terrible idea wound his mind to a pitch of dreadful anguish and scarcely knowing what he did he darted like lightning from the house determined to explore the inmost recesses of the wood and even to traverse the very mountains in search of her after a lapse of many hours towards the close of the evening he returned unable to give the smallest account of where he had been wandering and with a raging fever burning in his veins scarce had he power distracted as he was to ask if tidings of his lilla had yet arrived ere confirmed by a dreadful negative in his despair he fell senseless upon the earth he was immediately conveyed to bed by order of victoria wild delirium seized his brain his ravings and frantic struggles to escape from those who surrounded him were dreadful to hear and to behold for three weeks his life was despaired of and the phrenzy which possessed him scarcely left hopes that even if it were spared his mind could ever recover its former sanity meanwhile the poor lilla the guiltless cause of so much havoc continued to linger in her dreadful confinement the moor zofloya attended her with undeviating punctuality furnished her with provisions and a mantle of leopardskin to preserve her in some degree from the flinty hardness of the ground and on which too often she was in her own despite compelled to stretch her tender limbs yet in this pitiable situation she still lived and still cherished faint hope in her spotless bosom that time would end her miseries and restore her to the world and to him she fondly adored sometimes she trusted to soften the impenetrable moor but hope of that soon faded from her heart when he appeared for though he brought her food he never uttered </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> uttered a single sentence and if by chance his eye met hers the gloomy fierceness of its expression damped the assumed courage of her innocent soul and the little resolution she might have acquired in his absence faint dawning of returning reason and reanimated life began at length to reveal themselves in the unhappy henriquez during the whole of his illness victoria had never quitted his apartment administering to him with her own hands every medicine that was prescribed and sleeping by night with one of her attendants in his chamber when the powers of his mind became sufficiently restored to recognize surrounding objects her attentions if possible redoubled and could henriquez have divested himself of the unconquerable disgust with which he viewed her her singular tenderness and care towards him must have excited in him the utmost gratitude and regard but vain was her solicitude rather painful than pleasing to him and the moments in which his wretched mind felt most relief from intolerable anguish were those very few in which she was absent from him but his coldness and repugnance was either unperceived or unheeded by victoriashe became daily more passionately tender more undisguised in her manner towards him and this as well involuntarily as by the previous decision of her mind gloomy melancholy and perpetual abstraction still however possessed the unfortunate henriquez when conceiving that she advanced too slowly by simply paying the attentions of friendship so understood at least to henriquez she resolved once more gently to probe the present situation of his heart respecting her for presumptuously she flattered herself that her complete devotion to him throughout a long and dangerous malady must in some degree have impressed him in her favor one evening when she was sitting in his apartment with the silent meditative henriquez he feeling an anxious wish to indulge in solitude the luxury of his grief gently though with perfect coolness observed to her i do not desire signora thus to bea tax upon your time and your friendship i pray you now that i am so far convalescent be less punctilious in your attentions towards me and use some recreation to relieve your mind determined to let no opportunity pass for touching upon the subject nearest her heart victoria replied in a voice of tender reproach cruel henriquez is it thus you address one who lives but in your presence forbear at least forbear to taunt a heart that loves as signora with agitation interrupted henriquezis this a timeis this a subjects thought it was never more to be renewed i can forbear no longer exclaimed victoria throwing herself at his feet soh henriquez i loves adore you to madnessif you have a spark of feeling of compassion in your soul reject me not but pity a wretch who feels it impossible to overcome her fatal passion henriquez knew not how to reply for he felt that local circumstances made gratitude due to victoria yet her present base avowal doubly infamous at such a timeher abject prostration at his feet excited anew all the gall of his bosom against her and spite of every consideration he found it impossible to treat her with softness for a few moments then he remained in painful silence but his determination to crush at once those hopes his anguished heart told him he could never realiseshocked too at the cruel indelicacy that so early could attempt to obliterate from his mind all traces of his first and only loveth attempted with impatient gesture to raise her from the groundfinding however that with stillexisting feebleness he was incapable of doing so he said signora i entreat you to rise from your unworthy situationtill then i cannot say any thing victoria in violent agitation arose signora then pursued henriquez my heart is still smarting with agony in the never to be forgotten affliction of having lost the only being for whom i ever considered life desirableness feel signora that the anguish of that heart will not long endure for though my body becomes sane my feelings convince me that the wound i have received no time can heal and that i shall expire god grant it soon of a broken heartthis alone signora you might deem a sufficient reply to the confession with which you have just honored me but that i may not by an undue warmth of expression leave the shadow of doubt upon your mind respecting my cooler feelings or my unchangeable sentiments let me at once add that were circumstances even different from what they arewere my soul even unattached to the pure heavenly memory of my lost lillahad i never even known her to become attached still signora the present feelings of my heart towards you convince me that even then i could never have returned your flattering partialities feel that weare dissimilar in every respect nay more whether from a fault of my nature i know notbut i feel likewise that i could sooner poignard myself he added with an encreased elevation of voice than bring myself to entertain for you the slightest sentiments of tenderness tis well cried victoria in accents scarcely articulate ungrateful henriquezyou are indeed explicit farewells will no longer pain you by my presence yet ere i go call to mind that your lilla still mourned for is no more but her memory still livesstill triumphs in my bleeding heartcried the agonized henriquez starting from his seat and wildly clasping his emaciated hands when overcome by weakness and the conflicting violence of his emotions he could no longer support himself but fell languished on the floor victoria returning flew towards him and raising him in her arms laid her head upon his bosom hah she cried while the bitter smile of disappointed pride and passion passed over her featuresah stubborn relentless henriquez thou shalt yet be mine though death </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> death were the consequence deathdeath will be the consequence cried the half frantic henriquez who had caught her last words and perceiving that his head reclined upon her bosom started hastily from the floor as though he felt the sting of a scorpion victoria fearful of returning delirium spoke no more but assisting him against his will to rise led him to the side of his bed and left him to himself with perturbed and gloomy spirits mechanically she bent her steps towards the forest it was late in the evening the sky was overcast with black heavy clouds but unheeding she pursued her way the thunder now rattled over her head and the blue lightning flashed across her path her mind however too engaged in its internal warfare regarded not the warring of the elements and external circumstances had rarely power to affect her stubborn mind hah what means can i pursue she cried aloud certain that no one was nigh show satisfy my destroying passion shall all i have done be in vain then and the sole object of my ardent wishes the goal of my hopes elude at last my wild pursuitno no it must not beyet that he were mine at last i would not hesitate to plunge my soul in deepest perdition for his sake for without him i cannot livethis world would to me be an earthly purgatory ah zofloyawhy art thou not here to offer thy assistance and advice surely thou wilt not forsake meat the period when most i need thy aid or perhaps even thou art powerless to assist me in this as she uttered these words a soul enchanting melody rose gradually in swelling notes upon her ear she paused to listener mind became calmed and wrapt in attention she wondered at the magical powers of the invisible musician in a few minutes it sunk in thrilling cadence and was heard no more the gloom of victorias mind began to return and angry that any external circumstance should have had power fora moment to interrupt the despondency of her thoughts she prepared disgusted as she was at not having met with zofloya to leave the forest as she hastily turned however suddenly she encountered him i am glad zofloya to behold thee she cried but how camst thou here for till this moment i have not seen thee i have followed you signora for some time past hand why wouldst not thou overtake me that i might have the frequent yet ever new delight fair victoria of hearing myself called upon then why didst thou not reveal thyself you were listening i believe to the music soon as it ceased you turned and we metbut say victoria how speed your wishes alas miserable wretch that i am returned victoriamuch i fear success will never be minehenriquez loaths me this evening only did he formally finally and coolly reject me hand his excuse for refusing the loveliest of her sex love and ceaseless devotion to the memory of his lillayet has he insultingly added that had a lilla never existed victoria could have had no power to excite his love most insensible idiot indignantly cried the moor she would have loved you i presume had you chanced to have resembled lilla hah would cried the degenerate victoria would that this unwieldy form could be compressed into the fairy delicacy of hers these bold masculine features assume the likeness of her baby faceah what would i not submit to to gain but one look of love from the pitiless henriquez beautiful victoria cried the moor in a soft flattering voicecall not that graceful form unwieldy nor to those noble and commanding features offer such indignity eminent loveliness is yourscould the tasteless henriquez but believe you lillahe pausedand victoria fixed her eager searching eyes upon his countenancewhen finding that zofloya did not proceed she exclaimed speak speak zofloya if you have aught to suggest withhold it not an instant from me at this moment a vivid flash of lightning dividing the skies zofloya said let us seek signora a more sheltered spotthe storm appears encreasing soh heed not the stormbut speak cried victoria if aught you can adduce to sooth the despair of my mind you heed not the lightning signora neither do deign then to answer me is it now your firm belief that henriquez will never grant you his love alas i have said so replied victoria in a gloomy accent hand under these circumstances do you still love himstill feel him necessary to your happiness sooner then resign all hopes of obtaining him i would plunge this instant a stiletto in my bosom zofloya remained a few moments silent and then resumed if you could only obtain his love and every mark of unrestrained passion in the delusive belief on his side that you were his betrothed lilla would you upon such terms accept soh yes with joy with delight interrupted victoriasay but how such blissful delusion could be conveyed to his mind nit grows late signorathe storm becomes more violent shall i defer till the morrow what further i might say if you would have me expire at your feet cried victoria wildlyattempt to leave me thus unsatisfiedin the very midst too of the faint hope you have suffered to beam upon my soulwhat of the hourwhat of the storm she pursued as the blue lightning conjured trees of fire and seemed to dance upon the summit of the mountainswhat even of the dissolution of nature in a moment like this when my soul pants for well then interrupted the moor noble intrepid victoria mark me for truly do i love and glory in your firm shrinking spirits possess a drug the peculiar property of which it isnot to stupid the faculties or induce actual insanity but to cause a sort of </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> of temporary delirium upon any particular point optional with those who shall administer this drugfor instance a partial mania as it were as many that are termed mad may be perfectly sane upon every subject but the individual one which caused their madnessthis drug has a singular power of confusing the mind and of so far deluding it that those who take it must inevitably believe that which it is desired to convey to their mindsthus those who go mad for love imagine that in every female they see her who caused their madness involuntarily pursuing and indulging the conceit which is uppermost in their diseased fanciesyou begin signora to obtain some insight into the nature of my plantae only one that suggests itself at this pressure for the atchievement of your loveallow me to proceed howeverthis drug which i will give you being administered to henriquez suppose this night when with a restrained and tranquil tenderness such as might befit a sister you give him ere he sleeps some draught of a refreshing or composing nature during the night it will have leisure to attain its proposed effect in the morning on awakening he will be furious for lilla her image having so possessed him during the night that he will be almost incapable of considering it as the mere delusion of a dreamin consequence of his possession strange and unaccountable to those around being reported to you considered by all as a proof of confirmed lunacy you will instantly hasten to his chamberscarcely will you have entered ere flying towards you he will clasp you with wild fervor in his arms calling you his adored his long lost lilla victoria unable any longer to restrain her emotions threw herself upon her knees and clasped her hands eagerly together soh rapture oh inexpressible bliss she criedoh moment for which my heart so long has pantedshall i then at length be claspedvoluntarily and ardently clasped to the bosom of henriquez oh enfeebled soul help me to support the reality of this happiness which now thou trembles but to think of preserve your transports fair victoria reserve them for that moment which i swear to you shall arrive meantime arise and hear me to an end henriquez being fully persuaded that you are his idolized lilla will call you by the name of wise and believe you such for his mind will be in that state of anarchy and confusion he will have no conception of time that is past nor that his marriage fixed to have taken place on a given day long since elapsed has never yet been performedhe will merely be enabled to combine your appearance with your supposed return and feel as though after suffering for your loss deep affliction for a certain space of time you were at length restored to his arms the elation of his spirits will be great inconsequence his mind will be attuned to love and pleasure and you must beware of doing aught to thwart or offend him indulge him with wine enliven him with music let an elegant banquet be prepared humour his delusion assume as much as possible the character of lilla and of his wifein all you do be collected be firm and love shall be propitious to your wishes once more and for the last time zofloya drew forth the box the fatal repository of so much mischiefthen placing in the hands of victoria a small folded paper containing the philtre to which he had alluded he bade her with a serious smile use well her advantages and without another sentence turned suddenly away as he retreated into the thick gloom of the forest a vivid flash now and then revealed his swift moving figure to her viewnow emerging from among the treesnow scaling the pointed rock and now appearing a figure of fire upon its lofty summit victoria too inebriated with joy at the prospect she beheld of at length obtaining her dearest wishes to remark or wonder at the precipitate departure of the moor thought only of the exquisite happiness he had promised her and unmindful of the awe inspiring thunderunmindful of the red lightning which gleaming around at quick repeated intervals shewed mountains rocks and forests of fire remained with undefended form but a heart beating high with the fervor of hope rooted as it were to the spot in idolatrous anticipation of future bliss at length forcibly rousing herself she returned to the castle on her way she beheld no traces of zofloya and concluded an idea not unfavourable to his character that he had chosen a night like the present to wander among the mountains she proceeded however and entering the castle gently approached the chamber of henriquezwith air humbled and abashed she presented herself before him and addressed him in a faltering voice of tender humility again henriquez became the dupe of her artificeagain he regretted his cruel explicitness and though he could not help feeling for her a certain portion of involuntary disgust he received her with gentle politeness she with wellassumed melancholy softness but secret exultation busied herself in silence in little offices about his chamber these completed and arranged she proposed to retire for the nighthenriquez with a grateful bow as if for her attention acquiesced in the movement when victoria retreating with an air of mortified resignation towards the door pretended suddenly to remember that she had not administered to him a certain restorative medicine which with her own hand she had insisted on presenting to him every night since his recovery hastily returning at the further end of the room remote from the pensive henriquez she prepared his mixture and infused the drug given her by zofloya approaching him then with hand rendered unsteady from ravishing anticipation of the effects it would produce she tendered it to him henriquez </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> henriquez felt no inclination for his potion yet unwilling to dismiss victoria from him with an aching heart he took it with a soft thankful smile from her hand and instantly drank it offthis accomplished so far with frame still tremulous and heart wildly beating with the thoughts of the morning victoria received back the glass and bidding him farewell retired from the chamber henriquez having laid his head upon his pillow soon fell into a heavy sleep his mind became gradually disturbed and the form of lilla glided in his view now as formerly he beheld her under the same roof with himself constituting a part of the familynow she sat beside himnow rambled with him in the forest and now bestowed on him her innocent endearments pure as innocence itself all night these blissful but deceptive visions haunted his fancy and when towards morning he awoke so far was the delusion from vanishing with sleep that scarce could he restrain himself in his bed though a confused idea of the earliness of the hour prevented him from arising every moment however his infatuation encreasedhe believed that he had been for a long time in a state of mental derangement that he had only now recovered his senses and that the image of lilla being so deeply impressed upon his mind was owing to his having actually beheld her the day preceding of which he even thought he entertained a faint recollection unable longer to contend with the powerful delusions of his disordered fancy he started wildly from his bed and flew towards the wellknown spot in the forest where frequently they had been wont to ramble loudly he called upon the name of lilla till his voice obtaining involuntary latitude he repeated that dear loved name briefly and incessantly till he panted for breath finding at length that his search was vain he returned to the castle victoria anxiously upon the watch heard all his movements the better to deceive him she wore a veil of lillas and such parts of her dress as might suit indiscriminately either the one or the other his conduct had already evinced to her how powerfully the philtre was acting but she deemed it expedient to increase his impatience that the delusion practised upon him might be the less liable to detection she had left her own apartment and now occupied that of the poor victim lillapresently she heard the distracted lover pacing to and fro before the wellknown door he firmly believed to enclose his mistress this was the moment for victoriashe threw open the door of the chamber as if by chance and came forth scarcely was she beheld by henriquez ere he darted towards her and seizing her in his arms exclaimed wife of my soulmy beloved my darling lillahave i then at length recovered the pride of my life the darling of my bosomher for whom alone existence is worthy the bearingoh my hearts lilla speak to me my love and tell me whence thou comest and whither thou hast been who can describe the delight of victoria at this proof of the extravagance of henriquez she clearly perceived his distraction to be at the heighth and that without fear she might humour the deception looking tenderly upon him she cried dearest henriquez be composed i have indeed never departed from thee since the day of our marriage but dost thou not remember on that eve which should have proved so blissful thou wert attacked by sudden malady and conveyed to bedfor nearly three weeks thou wert insensiblenor couldst thou oh my love recognize even thy faithful wife although she neither quitted thee by night nor day but no more of the melancholy pastthou knowest me now ah little durst i hope when sad and heartbroken i retired from thee last night that this morning would bring with it such happiness hand wert thou with me last night my lillaoh yesi know thou wert for now i recollection he pressed his hand upon his burning forehead know i recollectsurely thou hast never once been from me yet i thoughts thoughtful i must have beenthat thou wert not lillabut ah i must indeed have been severely ill to mistake that heavenly face no more my henriquezmy husband cried the artful victoria but let this blissful day be dedicated to love and joy and although we have never in reality been separatedyet let us celebrate this day as for our restoration to each other at these words the heart of the poor henriquez bounded in his bosomfor his brain was high wrought fired to phrenzy and madly eager for noisy revelry and delight he seized the hand of victoria and pressing it to his lips cried out aloud in a mirthful voice let us feast and dance then on this glorious day my lillalets have a banquet lets have music and cause the mountains to reecho eyes yes my love interrupted victoria joyfully smiling we will have a banquet and music and in these beautiful solitudes we will be the world to each other ahspoken like my lilla cried henriquez if we were in venice we should be tortured with guestsyet do we need no company but that of each otherthou mayest truebut we must dance then my lillayes he added with a loud laugh we must dance together or by heaven i shall die of pent up bliss he threw his arm round the waist of the joymad victoria and in wild sport dragged rather than led her from the spot on this day high beat her heather bosoms fierce triumph flashed from her eyes as she gazed on the devoted youth and secretly she swore to bestow upon zofloya whatever reward he should desire for thus accomplishing her souls first wish at once she gave orders for a sumptuous feast and </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> and determined that the day should be dedicated in compliance to the whim of henriquez to mirth and revelry the most delicious viands the choicest and most intoxicating wines constituted the banquet and as she pressed them upon henriquez his blood circulated with wilder rapidity and the delirium of his brain encreased the graceful zofloya highly skilled in the science of harmony and seated at the further end of the banqueting room retired from others who occasionally joined him but a host in himself drew from his harp sounds of such overpowering melody as by turns reduced the soul into the most delicious softness or excited it with transport even to madnessnow drowned in tender tears the inspired henriquez listened with restrained enthusiasmnow raised to distracting rapture he leaped from his seat and his strong emotion found no vent but on the beating bosom of victoria her he pressed eagerly in his arms and on that treacherous breast shed tears of the wildest transport in his phrenzy he had desired to dance and victoria with the grace of a sylph flitted in varied movements to the soft music of zofloyahenriquez gazed with ravished eyes but soon starting up seized her by the hands and joined with her in the dance while zofloya struck a wilder note to the no longer measured footsteps till a late hour of the evening the pleasures of the banquet were protracted even till the highwrought spirits of henriquez becoming less violent though his delusion still continued in full force he said i am weary beloved lilla of this excess of happinessmy mind feels jaded and confused as though it stood in need of rest to restore its energieslet us retire then my life and in gentle dreams we may retrace the pleasures of the day never had the sun risen on a day of equal horror to that which succeeded the one just describedscarce had its first beam played into the chamber of henriquez ere sleep forsook his eyes and with that all the traces of the wild delirium that had possessed his brain on the preceding dayyes the delusion was at an end scarce could his frenzied gaze believe the sight which presented itself not the fair lilla the betrothed and heartwedded wife of his bosom but victoria appearing lilla no longer blasting his strained eyes with her hated imagesleep still overpowered her senses unconscious of the horror she inspired those black fringed eyelids reposing upon a cheek of dark and animated huethose raven tresses hanging unconfinedoh sad oh damning proofswhere was the fair enamelled cheekthe flaxen ringlets of the delicate lillareal madness now seized the brain of the wretched henriquezhis eyeballs bursting almost from their sockets furiously rolled till he could gaze no longera frantic cry escaped his lipsit was the inarticulate name of lilla as springing a raging maniac from the bed he snatched a sword that hung on the opposite wall and dashing its hilt on the floor threw himself in desperate agony upon its pointexposed defenceless as he was it entered instantly his beating breast and he sunk to the ground bathed in his purple gore victoria had awakened as he sprang from the bed but not in time to prevent his dreadful and unthought for deed she reached him only as he fell and casting herself wildly on her knees beside him raised his head upon her bosom at her touch strong convulsive shuddering seized the frame of the dying henriquez he sought to lift his head from her breast and dash it on the ground when finding himself incapable of doing so his agonies encreased tenfoldfor a moment his closing eyes glared upon her as in desire of vengeance but the strong emotion expired with his fleeting breath and a harrowing smile a smile of despairing triumph passed over his waning features as though he would have said thus do i escape thee for ever persecuting fiendno word passed his lipsno sigh heaved his bosom and exulting in his agonies he died thus vanished at once victoria beheld her deathreared visionsfrantic rage fired her soul at the thought and keen disappointment maddened her brain now she clasped her hands and twisted her fingers in each other and now tore by handfuls the hair from her head strewing it in agony over the lifeless body of henriquez at length her violence subsided a sudden portentous calm took possession of her mind and she started on her feet wildly she seized her dagger and throwing a few clothes over her revolved in her mind a confusion of horrible intent quitting hastily the chamber of despair and death yet instinctively securing the door after her she sped her way into the forest scarce was she herself conscious of the dire purpose that throbbed at her heart yet her steps were directed towards that fatal spot where in hopeless imprisonment the miserable lilla still languished now nerved with hellish strength she ascended the sloping rocknow the cataract foamed loud in her ears the rapidity of her movements encreased scarcely she felt the rugged ground the mountainous steep appeared a level path and yawning precipices inspired no dread at length she beheld herself where instinctive rage and terrible despair had led her till this moment never had she visited the defenceless object of her hate and vengeance indifferent to her state whether of death or longprotracted torment never had she sought of zofloya aught concerning her and unnoticed even on this fatal morn had she still remained but for the horrible purpose that had seized her soula purpose fitted as the catastrophe to the scenes which had preceded it without pausing to take breath she rushed hastily down the rugged descent which led into the gloomy dungeon of the orphan lilla the sight that then presented itself nerved instead of softening the fierce rage of her </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> her bosom extended on the flinty ground lay the emaciated and almost expiring girl her pale cheek reposing upon her snowy arm barely preserving it from unworthy contact with its rocky pillow beside her were some coarse fragments of scanty food victoria approaching raised her dagger which she firmly grasped and seizing her chained wrist loudly commanded her to rise with trembling limbs the feeble lilla endeavored to obey over her alabaster shoulders was thrown a mantle of leopard skin brought her by zofloya and her flaxen tresses hung around her in mournful disorder clasping her thin hands upon her polished bosom and with some of her long tresses still in pure unaltered modesty essaying to veil it she raised her eyes of heavenly blue to the stern and frantic countenance of her gloomy persecutor appearing in figure grace and attitude a miniature semblance of the medical venus minionaccursed child wildly shrieked the maddened victoria prepare for deathfor even in this state of forlornness and woe the seraph beauty of the orphan lilla rising preeminent to circumstance and situation excited her jealousy and renewed her rageah victoria in mournful accents she cried his it youyou then who would kill me i thought i hoped only that your angry looks bid me doubt that you came to give me liberty i do wretchpuny babbler she answeredbeholdunloosing with frantic violence the chain from her wrist i come to give thee libertythe liberty of death alas victoria in what then have i offended you that you should hate me thusah consider i am but a poor and friendless orphan who can never do you ill peace i say puppet shrieked victoria thou hast already done me more ill than the sacrifice of thy worthless life can repayfollow me i cannot walki cannot follow you indeed sobbed the innocent lilla while the tears rolled fast down her snowwhite cheeks then will i teach thee cried victoria and seizing her by the arm dragged her over the rugged ground and up the irregular ascent while her delicate feet naked and defenceless to the pointed rock left their blood red traces at every step still to the uttermost heigh she forced relentless her panting victim know look down she cried a bottomless abyss yawned at the mountains base and from the opposite side the tumbling torrent rushed furious over immense projections till finding the receptacle of the abyss it dashed down its rugged sides into the cavity below seest thou cried victoria again know then stand firm beautiful unconquerable lilla thou whom no art could root from the breast of henriquez stand firm i sayfor now i push thee headlong soh mercy mercy shrieked in accents of agony the terrified lilla clinging with the strength of horror round the body of victoriaoh sweet victoria remember we have been friendship loved thee nay even now i love thee and believe that thou art madoh think think we have been companions bedfellowssweet and gentle victoria murder not then the friendless lilla who for worlds would not injure thee i tell thee thou shalt die wretch wert thou not the beloved of henriquez henriquezah me i was indeed but where where is henriquez now victoria dead dead with a fiendlike laugh cried victorialet me send thee to him deadah cruel victoria murdered by thee murdered by thee viper fiercely returned victoriatwas thee who plunged the sword into his breastthy accursed image revelling there impelled him to the frantic deedleave thy hold i say or by heaven i will dash thee at once down the rock soh henriquezart thou indeed goneyes yes or the wretched lilla would not be thusno one would dare she sobbed while thou wert near thus to treat the miserable lillano hope no happiness for her now in lengthened life die then at once presumptuous babbler exclaimed victoria endeavouring to shake off the firmly clinging form of the defenceless lilla hah dearest victorian am afraid of so terrible a deathif i must die be it then the same death as my henriquez sufferedplunge thy stiletto in my heart that will i do cried the enraged victoria hand dash thee headlong beside raising her dagger high she sought then to plunge it in the fair bosom of the beauteous orphan but she suddenly relinquishing her hold the point of the dagger wounded only her uplifted hand and glancing across her alabaster shoulder the blood that issued thence slightly tinged her flaxen tresses with a brilliant red the courage of the wretched lilla forsook herthe death she had preferred her innocent soul shrunk from enduring but perceiving that victoria was desperate and determined she resolved to make a last effort for her lifeagain the fell poignard was uplifted for surer aimwhen springing from her knees on which she had cast herself to implore mercy she forgot at once her wounds and her weakness and endeavoured by speed to escape her barbarous enemy seeming as she wildly flew the beauteous and timid spirit of the solitude nerved anew by this feeble attempt to escape her vengeance victoria pursued her flying victim at the uttermost edge of the mountain she gained upon her when lilla perceiving that hope of escape was vain caught frantic for safety at the scathed branches of a blasted oak that bowed by repeated storms hung almost perpendicularly over the yawning depth beneathround these she twisted her slender arms while waving to and fro with her gentle weight over the immeasurable abyss they seemed to promise but precarious support victoria advanced with furious looks she shook the branches of the tree that lilla might fall headlong enhorrored at this terrible menace the miserable girl quitted suddenly her hold and on the brink of the mountain sought despairingly to grapple with the superior force of her adversaryher powers were soon exhausted when clasping together her hands and looking piteously upon </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> upon that which had received the wound from whence the blood now streamed up to her elbow she exclaimed barbarous victorialook down upon me behold what thou hast done and let the blood thou hast shed appease thee ah little did i think when a deserted orphan invited by thee to remain beneath thy roof that such would be my miserable fate remember that victoriahave pity on meant i will pray of heaven to forgive thee the past the only answer of victoria was a wild laugh and again she raised the poignard to strike his it even so then cried the despairing lillatake then my life victoria take it at oncebut kill me i implore with that same dagger with which you murdered henriquez because he loved me more than he did you fired to madness by this accusation and the concluding remark victoria no longer mistress of her actions nor desiring to be so seized by her streaming tresses the fragile lilla and held her backwith her poignard she stabbed her in the bosom in the shoulder and other partsthe expiring lilla sank upon her kneesvictoria pursued her blows she covered her fair body with innumerable wounds then dashed her headlong over the edge of the steepher fairy form bounded as it fell against the projecting crags of the mountain diminishing to the sight of her cruel enemy who followed it far as her eye could reach soon as a hollow momentary sound struck on the rapt ear of victoria informing her that lilla was sunk into her grave no more to rise she hastened from the dreadful spot in a state of mind which if exulting was far from being at dispossessed rather with the madness and confusion of hell a certain trepidation of spirits that she had never before experienced caused her to rush along with even greater rapidity if possible than she had used in her way thither though sinking with fatigue she durst not abide in these gloomy solitudes to restshe feared even to turn her head left the mangled form of lilla risen from the stream should be pursuing her now precipices yawned at her feet and now that lovely form bounding from crag to crag seemed at every turn to meet her viewthose fair tresses dyed in crimson gore that bleeding bosom was before her and now the agonised shriek for mercy rang in her distracted ears at length she passed the rocks and issued into the forest from the narrow break that led to themat this moment the moor zofloya appeared before her as if he had there awaited her coming victoria he cried in a voice less sweet than usual and with a brow more gloomythou art too precipitately thereby hastened thy fatewhy hast thou destroyed the orphan lillathe deed was premature and thou wilt repent it mean time enter not the castle for evil awaits thee there who told thee i had murdered the orphan lilla haughtily returned victoria but if i have the deed is mine and i will answer itstand aside moor the castle is mine and i will enter it do so said the moor with a bitter smile hand thereby court the fate thou mightst yet a little have protracted the consequences be on my own head answered victoriai will pass thou shaltbut remember poor victoria that independently of me thou canst not even breathe with a look of scorn and disgust at the changed manner of the moor victoria turned from him and pursued her wayher mind already in a ferment could brook no additional irritation just as she reached the castle she beheld zofloya entering before her yet she had not seen him pass her and he had even remained some moments upon the spot where she had encountered him this circumstance excited some slight surprise but objects of higher consequence engaged her mind and she followed him into the castle her first step was to repair to the chamber of henriquezit immediately appeared to her that no one had found entrance to it during her absence the lifeless body bathed in its blood still remained extended on the floor and all was in the state she had left hershe decided therefore despising in her mind the false prophecies of zofloya to secure the door without as yet making known the death of henriquezhis nonappearance she readily conceived would excite no immediate remark he having frequently of late passed the whole of the day in his chamber thus she determined for her mind was a chaos and could suggest no better conduct for the momentto make fast the door repairing then to the solitude of her own apartment she secured it likewise and throwing herself upon her bed desired to take a retrospect of the past and consider if possible respecting the futureshe endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts but instead of this an unconquerable lassitude crept over her accompanied by a disposition to sleepin vain she tried to shake it off the influence became resistlessher eyelids involuntarily closed and she was compelled to yield to a power superior to her will total forgetfulness however did not ensueshe experienced a sensation similar to that of persons who have taken too large a quantity of opium to allow of calm undisturbed reposeto herself her eyes appeared as if strained to their fullest extentstrange visions swam in her sight yet unable to trust the delusion she believed herself under the unconquerable horrors of a waking dream now the ringing of bells sounded in her ears and now she beheld herself transported into an apartment distant from the habitable part of the castle and whichever since the death of berenza had not even been openedin this room formerly there had stood a huge iron chest this she had once seen now likewise it was present to her view and </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> and she recognised itsuddenly the door of the apartment was thrown open and a number of persons appeared rushing in consisting chiefly of the domestics of the castle one however preceded the rest and him her mind identified for the old and favourite servant of berenza named antonio with horror and perturbation in his looks antonio seemed rapidly advancing towards the chest and calling aloud for some of his companions to assist him by their joint efforts they raised the lid this was no sooner accomplished than a shout of universal horror prevailed accompanied by the strongest marks of terror and perturbation the cause was presently explainedforth from the chest they drew the disclosed half smouldered skeleton that once had been berenza at this sight of horror it seemed to her that with animated gestures of indignation and revenge they unanimously rushed towards her to drag her from her bedin the midst of this terrible scene zofloya entered at once the croud vanished the confusion ceased and in indescribable agony she awoke while the cold drops of terror bedewed her forehead on opening her eyes the first object she beheld was the moor standing infixed attitude at the foot of her bed his aspect was frigid and severe yet his eyes shone with lambent fire as a dark thundercloud emits the vivid flame conceiving the whole to be still delusion she cast her eyes anxiously around the chambers was gloomy and demand the evening seemed far advanced surprised that she should have slumbered so long she sought in confusion of mind to throw herself from the bed when the sweetly solemn voice of zofloya arrested her movement victoria he said attend this morning you unwarily disregarded my words but nevertheless for the love i bear towards you i desire to preserve you from immediate destructionalready have the unrestrained passions of your soul precipitated your fate and hastened the shame that waits to overcome you from that shame even yet i offer to rescue youlisten to what i shall revealyou have dreamt but it was no fable you have slept some hours the sun had not long passed the horizon when you entered your chamber and now the evening is drawing to a closest an early hour of the night the servant of the deceased berenza antonio will retire to reposea fearful dream will awaken him concerning the disappearance of the body of his late master actuated by its resistless influence he will arise and alarm his fellow domesticshe will relate to them his dream naturally weak and superstitious they will be all induced to accompany him to the solitary chamber remote from the habitable part of the castle therecontained in the iron chest withinthey will discover the mouldering skeleton of berenza soh zofloya zofloyais this thy truth and thy friendship exclaimed victoria didst thou not promise thou wouldst preserve me from suspicion and from ill i said not that i could do so forever over the body of the conte i had not eternal poweryet thy own folly and impatience hath hastened hah little could i dream of this reserve interrupted victoria yet surely surely it is in thy power to preserve me for ever from suspicion for zofloya thou possesses superior powerthe future is exposed to thy viewthou anticipates events and canst therefore guard against them save me then save me i implore thee from the shame thou mayest awaits memor wretch shall i consider myself ever to have confided in thy power or thy promises the terrible eyes of zofloya shot fire as they turned their burning glances on victoria this is no time he fiercely exclaimed for retrospect or idle observation if you repent your confidence do in the present instance without my assistancewrithe between the pillars of st marki may visit you there perhaps farewellbut remember he added shaking his finger with a menacing air remember there is now no escape for you soh strange mysterious and tome indefinable being cried victoria your words your looks terrify and confound me yet go not she continued as with angry though majestic pace zofloya moved towards the door abandon me not at this crisis cruel zofloya the moor turned from the door fire gleamed no longer from his eyes but a beautiful and haughty smile diffused itself over his countenance which appeared like the sun beaming from a gloomy cloud well thenonce more thou entreated he cried nonce more i befriend thee but beware victoria how again i am reproachedto irritate me now would be vain and impolitic and sharpen against thyself that sentiment of hate which i bearbut this is irrelevant he hastily addedsuspicion will as i said attach to thereby what means induced i scarcely need now explain the terrible inquisition will drag thee before its tribunal infinite confusion will reign in this castle the chamber of henriquez will be forced open for strange surmises begin already to prevail concerning thee and instantly they will discover that which of itself would damn theethe body of henriquez remains bathed in its blood upon the floor of his chamberbeside it lies thy veil and divers articles of dress in which thou wert seen yesterday thy guilt in the estimation of all will be made clearly evident but forbearing to alarm thee with the knowledge of their discovery they will secure thee merely a prisoner in thine own apartment and dispatch messengers to venice for the purpose of making it known and bringing condign punishment on thy head need i expatiate upon the events that will followpublic infamy and public soh spare me cried victoria horrible is my fateyet i swear to thee zofloya that i would meet it with indifference if henriquez still lived and lived for me ah tell me moor didst thou not promise that beware victoriato the very extent of my promise have i performers swore to thee </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> thee that henriquez should call thee his and clasp thee voluntarily to his bosomi swore to thee that thou shouldst have his lovedid i promise thee that his delusion should last for ever or profess to be amenable for those consequences which should follow the completion of my promise victoria longed to replybut awe and terror checked the words that rose to her lips yet the idea glanced for an instant through her mind and bitter was the suggestion how fleeting and how shortlived had been the moments of precarious pleasure procured for her by zofloya yet how terrible and how lasting the evils they had produced they were as the passing shadows the mere mockery only of what they promised while real horrors waiting to overwhelm and destroy attended close upon them the moor with a piercing glance seemed to penetrate her inmost thoughts a shade of severity passed over his features and he said if you hesitate respecting the path you should pursue at present i leave you free to chuse victoria clasped her handstoo well she beheld the desolate prospect before hereto keenly felt the words of the moorthere appeared indeed no escape for her decide victoria cried zofloya with encreased sternness i do i do replied victoria i confide in youi rely on you to save me from the horrors that now encompass me or to bear me safely through them to save me from them zofloya she added emphatically for ever sto that i pledge myselfyou shall be saved for ever from the disgrace and horrors that here await youbut you must fly fly yesfor i cannot turn the tide of events in which i have no concern i cannot victoria influence the course of justice nor prevent that from arising which arises independently of me whatever you may deem my power be assured that although i may induce the occurrence of many events that otherwise might not have been yet i cannot prevent from occurring aught which is already written in the book of fate hand whither then must i fly with an abstracted air demanded victoria entrust that to mea few words more and i gotake heed that you rest where you areresign yourself unresisting to reposeit will be calm and undisturbed but deepon the morrow when this abode shall be the seat of confusion when the city of venice shall be alarmed and your person be even vociferated for by the populace who will surround your palazzo there then shall you be far from danger from pursuit and from venice as zofloya concluded slightly waving his hand he suddenly turned and retreated from the apartment with the rapidity of a passing shade it was now quite dark victoria was sensible neither of hunger nor thirst yet felt a desire to retrace the terrible events that had been crowded into her lifethe attempt was vain a numbing torpor began to creep over her as before she essayed to conquer it though contrary to the direction of zofloya and her incapacity to do so conveyed a bitter pang to her heart while she felt that she was no longer mistress over herself or her faculties chill horror took possession of her and in an agony of mind that words cannot describe seeming subject as it were to an unknown power and unable to resist she hopelessly resigned herself to the arbitrary spell that appeared to be cast over her darkness and gloomy solitude reigned around when the eyes of victoria again opened to the sense of life and perception she found herself reclining on the bare earth the thunder rolled aloud over her head and flashes of vivid flame now and then displayed the terrific sublimity of surrounding objectsimmense mountains piled upon one another appeared to encompass her and to include within their inaccessible bosoms the whole of the universe beyond their towering walls capped only by the misty clouds the imagination suddenly thrown back and staggered at its own conceptions could not presume to penetratemighty rocks and dizzying precipices at their base in which the water falling from an immeasurable height franticly battled gloomy caverns which seemed the entrance to pandemonium alpine cliffs that in their fierce projection menaced ruin to the wretch beneathsuch was the scene that as the blue lightning flashed in terrible and stupendous confusion struck upon her viewamidst these awful horrors with folded arms and majestic air stationed nearly opposite to her stood the towering zofloya to him the scene appeared congenial and victoria acknowledged to herself that never before had she beheld him in his proper spherecommon objects seemed to shrink in his presence the earth to tremble at the firmness of his step now alone his native grandeur shone in its full glory not eclipsed by but adding to the terrible magnificence of the scene on him the eyes of victoria involuntarily fixed dignity and ineffable grace were diffused over his whole figurefor the first time she felt towards him an emotion of tenderness blended with her admiration and strange inconsistency amidst the gloomy terrors that pressed upon her heart amidst the sensible misery that oppressed her she experienced something like pride in reflecting that a being so wonderful so superior and so beautiful should thus appear to be interested in her fate as if he penetrated her thoughts the moor approached with a sweet though awful smile and extended his hand for her to rise trembling as much from consciousness at the confused sentiments she felt arising in her bosom as from alarm occasioned by external circumstances she took his proffered hand tell me zofloya she said in a tremulous accent tell me where we now are and how we came hither know you not beautiful victoria that we are among the alps the boundaries of your native kingdomhow we came hither is surely not material for you to </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> to knowbut we are safe but i have no remembrance of our journeyings i recollect aright it was evening when last we partedit appears evening still though latein what time then nit appears as it is late in the evening it was as you justly observe evening when we partedthis then infers the probability that a night and a day have nearly elapsed but howhave my faculties been so long suspended cried victoria with uneasiness hand it is to you alone that i am now indebted for their restorationoh zofloya i perceive too clearly how much how compleatly i am in your power she sighed deeply as she uttered these words and the conviction of her subjection pressed heavily upon her mindher selfconfidence vanished and uneasy sensations filled her bosom zofloya smiled and tenderly took her handwhy these reflections victoria and why these inferencesare you not now secure from the shame and horror that awaited youno common means could have extricated you in such an exigencethe case pressed and required prompt exertion why then regret if superior power was employed to save and to deliver you zofloya paused loud peal of thunder rattled madly above them and reverberated in stern and hollow sounds among the echoing rocksthe pointed lightning fearfully gleamed in long and tremulous flashesvictorias firm bosom felt appalled for never before had she witnessed the terrible phenomena of nature in a storm among the alps she drew closer to the proud shrinking figure of the moore passed his arms round her waist and gently pressed her to his breast victoria felt reassuredshe seemed to herself as an isolated being possessing no earthly friend or protector but him on whose bosom she now tremblingly reposed never till this moment had she been so near the person of the moorsuch powerful fascination dwelt around him that she felt incapable of withdrawing from his arms yet ashamed for victoria was still proud and blushing at her feelings when she remembered that zofloya however he appeared was but a menial slave and as such alone had originally become known to hershe sought but sought vainly to repress them for no sooner enveloped in the lightnings flash as he seemed when it gleamed around him without touching his persondid she behold that beautiful and majestic visage that towering and graceful form than all thought of his inferiority vanished and the ravished sense spurning at the calumnious idea confessed him a being of superior order while thus they remained in the midst of these terrible and sublime solitudes as there was a solemn pause in the fury of the storm which exhausted by its own violence seemed suspended only to collect force for renovated explosion the sound of human voices broke on their ears lights gleamed suddenly from the rocky heights which appearing rapidly to move like flaming meteors athwart a gloomy sky were discovered at length to be torches carried by the hands of men as they continued to approach their dress their arms and fierce demeanor revealed them for condottieri or banditti zofloya inclining his body said in a low voice to victoria be not alarmed we shall be presently surrounded by these bands hordes of whom infest these mountains particularly mount cenis where we now are but regret not the circumstance no immediate ill will arise on the contrary we may if we will procure shelter and accommodation victoria made no reply for by this time a ring began to be formed round them of armed men the red flame of whose torches betrayed forms and features of such desperate and horrid cast that scarcely bore they the semblance of human beingsone stepping from among them brandished his dagger and thus spoke what do ye here in the midst of this stormwhence came yewhither are ye going and what riches do ye carry that ye will resign at once without bloodshed whence we come and whither we designed to go is now immaterial answered zofloya the riches we possess are not worthy your notice but we desire to be led to your chief there was a pause among the band zofloya resumed you behold that we are unarmedyou have nothing therefore to fear in permitting us to see your chiefwe are neither spies nor enemies with bad intentso saying with an authoritative air he waved his hand as if to say lead on without further question thus at least the action appeared to be understood respectfully the ring opened on either side and him who had first spoken inclining his head with submissive air to the moor motioned to lead the way with one arm round the waist of victoria and holding a torch that had been tendered to him in the other hand zofloya walked stately in the midst of the band his plumed head towering above all as the lofty poplar of the forest proudly towers above surrounding shrubs astonishing being that he is thought victoriaeven these ferocious bandit are tamed into submission by the magic power of that fascinating voice they ascended the side of the mountain then by narrow and dangerous defiles gradually declinednow they touched on the brink of a precipice now glided with the ease of habit along the slippery ridges of stupendous rocksat length a deep hollow presented itself they descended its almost perpendicular sides and reached the rocky valley below a rude projecting mass of rock seeming to sustain itself in mid air as it were became by the winding of the path presently visible it extended nearly to the opposite side of the mountain forming thereby a kind of huge irregular archentering beneath it a narrow aperture presented itself through which oneby one the band began to pass victoria beheld herself in her turn at the darksome mouth of this cavern to which the overhanging brow of the rock formed a natural and tremendous portico </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> portico and again her spirits failed and her heart began to sink compelled to proceed however for the bandit from behind pressed onwards she consoled herself with the reflection that zofloya was nigh and resumed her courageby degrees the opening became more spacious but turning and winding in an endless labyrinth while other openings perpetually crossed their path sometimes divided from each other by anarch whose heavy summit was indivisible from the roof of the cavern sometimes by rude pillars of stone forming an irregular colonnade at length they found themselves in an extensive space whose slimy walls as the red glare of the torches passed along reflected the various and blended colours of the rainbow victoria looked around the gloomy cave reminded her of that in which the unfortunate lilla had been pitilessly immured and involuntarily she trembled one of the banditti approaching a certain part of the cavern with the butt end of his tromboni knocked loud and distinctly three successive times against it after a pause of about a minute the knocks were repeated on the inside he then drew from his girdle a small instrument in shape resembling a horn and applying it to his mouth he blew a shrill peculiar sound immediately that part which bore no remarkable appearance but seemed only a plain indissoluble portion of the rocky wall flew suddenly open inform of a rude door as if actuated by a secret spring and discovered seated round a blazing fire with wine and various provisions spread in rude confusion before them a crowd of bandit in savage attire resembling those who now rapidly poured in as if inspired by an anxious desire to partake of the good cheer they beheld in the midst of this horde the bandit ranged respectfully on either side elevated by a rude bench of stone from the rest who merely squatted on the floor appeared a graceful figure distinguished by his high and singleplumed helmet and by the fierce eccentric costume of his dress he looked and was the chief of the condottieri elected unanimously as their leader on the death of a famed chief who had preceded him his face was concealed by a mask which circumstance excited the surprize of victoria beside him sat fancifully but splendidly attired a female whose countenance though neither remarkable for extreme youth or beauty struck instantly peculiar emotion to her breast in the confused but uneasy recollection of having some where before beheld it in this idea she was confirmed by the look with which her slight glance was returned it bespoke instant recognition and with it fury and unfaded hate zofloya boldly advanced leading his companion by the hand the chief instinctively arose with a dignified and commanding air as the strangers drew nigh their chief the tenacious and suspicious bandit sprang on their feet to a man and drew as with one accord the shining stiletto from their belts to guard against the bare possibility of treachery or evil intent zofloya observing this movement haughtily smiled and waved his hand as if to imply that their suspicions were erroneous the chief by a turn of the head commanded them to put up their weapons and zofloya thus addressed him signor we are strangers but would willingly become friends we fly from danger and persecution and request for a while the safety of your protection victoria felt surprize to hear the moor speak thus but surprize at his conduct had ceased to be a new sensation she remained silent therefore and the chief thus replied nit is enoughwe injure not the defenceless nor those who throw themselves upon our mercy honour is our law and the lives of those who would place themselves under our protection are sacred i pray you then be seated and partake without compliment of our supperfriends be seated all and let your daggers remain sheathed in a moment every one resumed his seat drink said the masked chief and offered to zofloya a flask of wine who receiving it presented it immediately to victoria this movement appeared to draw towards her the regards of the chief for a moment they were fixed stedfastly upon her he became agitated and laid his hand upon the hilt of the stiletto in his belt then half rose from his seat and again reseated himselfvictoria trembled she knew not why the company seemed surprised zofloya alone remained collected and unmoved he pressed victoria to eat with respectful entreaty by degrees the chief resumed his composure he looked no longer towards victoria with pointed regard and her uneasiness abating she accepted the attentions of zofloya reserve wore off cheerfulness and at length conviviality began to prevail the band drank success to each other and health to their brave commander they joked they laughed they sang the female joined in their merriment with indecorous glee but the chief though no longer disturbed remained still silent and absorbed at length either displeased at their mirth or rousing himself by an effort he said hour brave comrades are all here hall replied several voices at once they go forth no more tonight let every one retire to repose save those whose turn it is to guard for you signor looking towards zofloya you must fare as we dovictoriathe signora i meanshe is neither your wife or mistress i presume will find matting to repose on in a separate nook of our cavern the words of the masked chief electrified victoriasurprize possessed her soul for it was evident she was known to him she looked towards the moor but in his strong marked countenance saw no unusual expression the signora is not my wife he replied addressing the chief neither is she my mistresses will be mine however for we are linked by indissoluble bands what i suppose the bands of love cried the female with </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> with a loud laugh as she sat beside the chief and now resembled a bacchante again the chief became visibly agitated yours he mutteredbut suddenly checking himself addedthe accommodations here are scantyyou must arrange for the best thereforethen haughtily inclining his head he retired beneath an arch at the extremity of the cavern which appeared to lead into an interior recess the female who seemed either his wife or companion retired likewise with skins and matting the moor zofloya composed for victoria a tolerable bed he spread it in a rugged nook remote from the band and leading her towards it was retiring when victorias proud but now almost subjugated heart touched with the respectful attentions of the only companion her vices and her crimes had left her extended to him with softened looks her handhe took it with tenderness yet delicate reserve and raised it to his lipshis manner but encreased to ardour the feelings of victoria the dying embers at the further side of the cavern cast round a dusky lightthe form the features and above all the luminous eyes of zofloya appeared more than humanities shone with a brilliant fireresistless fascination dwelt about him victoria as he held her hand to his lips gazed upon him with admiration and gratitude and her high wrought emotion vented itself in a flood of tears yes the proud the inhuman victoria conquered and affected by the shew of kindness wept from feeling from an emotion of the heartbut who could withstand the enchanting influence of zofloya sweet and gentle victoria he cried in a voice that seemed the music of the spheres compose yourself and retire to restwhy should my trifling attentions call forth this excess of feeling believe me i feel that you will yet repay me all repay thee zofloyai am thine ever i know that thou art in a degree lovely victoriabut not sufficiently so hah tell me then zofloyacan i be more soteach mentor i feels think that it is impossiblethe gratitude of my heart the sentiments of my soul are thine an indefinable yet bewitching smile passed over the features of zofloya hah victoria he softly said the time is not yet comes will not claim thee yetbut when i do then thou wilt be wholly and compleatly minewilt thou not hah zofloya zofloya thou wilt thou shalt fair victoria i have sworn itby myself i have sworn itbut nownow i leave thee to reposedelay will but encrease the value of my prize soh inscrutable moorthy language is ever indefinable time will explain itfairest victoria good night the moor withdrew and victoria sunk oppressed upon her coucha couch harder far than any on which hitherto she had reposedyet the poor departed lillawhispered conscience which in the gloomy hour of adversity ever wakes the poor lillashe had not even such as thisyet for the hardness of the couch for the pang of conscience what repaidstrange to say the conviction of zofloyas proximity who now shed enchantment around and ravished her deluded mind she fell at length into a slumber from which she did not awake till the noise of the bandit moving to and fro in the cavern caused her to start and gaze eagerly round for zofloya the only being on whom she now considered herself to possess the smallest claimhe observed her eager looks and hastening towards her said i have obtained permission of the chief sweet victoria that you shall quit the cavern and enjoy the keen air of the mountains he relies upon the word of zofloya that we return to this spot which has afforded us shelter in an hour of necessity and that whenever we quit it we shall consent to be escorted by some of his troop to the other side of the mountain or some miles forward in whatever direction we may desire to go this to avoid the possibility of evil design on our parts and to satisfy his mind with respect to usmean time he permits us to go unaccompanied has he yet unmasked whispered victoria hand can i see him she has notnor does he ever i understand in the presence of strangers come i have a basket of provisions on my armlet us quit for a few hours this subterraneous abodes last night noted the labyrinthian windings of the path leading to and from the mountain we shall need no guide victoria gave her hand to the moor secretly surprised he should have been able so readily to mark the devious waybut nothing was impossible to zofloya his noble presence seemed to diffuse around respect and admiration submissively the fierce bandit fell back as he passed when as they reached the rugged ascent leading to the mouth of the cavern and were on the point of issuing thence the graceful chief still masked appeared before them with his female companion leaning on his arm for a moment he flopped with a proud uneasy air when seeming to remark the respect manifested by the moor towards victoria he slightly bowed and retreated a few steps leaving room for them to pass beneath the frowning portico that concealed and overhung the aperture of the cavern his companion however fixed her eyes upon victoria with a look at once of hate and malicious scorn victoria felt agitated and again the features of this woman impressed forcibly her mindwell she remembered that bold and frenzied countenance though appearing far less beautiful than when she saw it first being now from irregular living or some other cause bloated and coarse but yet the neverfading expression of features so familiar to her fancy remained though the power of memory was vain to identify them as they emerged from subterranean gloom to the light of day victoria expressed to the moor the sensations which oppressed her i know not whence it is she said </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> said but the stately and solemn deportment of that chief affects me strangelyhis regards not of an approving kind are pointed particularly at methe sight of the female too agitates and discomforts measure i am zofloya that i have somewhere beheld that face nit is far from improbable observed zofloya but why should she regard me pursued victoria with looks so hostile and malignantwhy should the chief direct his looks towards me time will explain all laconically though with emphasis observed zofloya again but you are not surprized zofloya these incidents draw from you no remark i am never surprised but tell me at least thy thoughts i entreat thee my thoughts said the moor with a serious air and looking gloomily upon victoria yesthou takes methinks zofloya no part in the common occurrences of lifewhat are thy thoughts destructionhe returned in a terrible voice victoria involuntarily shuddered truehe pursuedi take no part in the common occurrences of life common occurrences do not interest me the dreadful the terrific the surprising alone of nature have power to call me forthnor even in them do i mix unless invited or allured soh zofloya cried victoria wretched and friendless as i am yet ever to lament that thy converse tome is unintelligible nit will not always be so victoria but seat thyself here beside me and let us discourse on other subjects victoria obeyedfor it was impossible for her to resist the smallest proposition of the moorhe placed himself near her and entreated her to partake of the provisions he had brought but she felt an oppression at her heart and could not eatperceiving her uneasiness he passed his arm round her waist and said fair victoria why this discontent wherefore this gloom canst thou not place thy entire confidence in memor canst thou not be happy with zofloyasay at once for thou knowest lovely creature that we are affianced victoria started involuntarilyzofloya what mean you a truce fair victoria to follyam i not thy equalay thy superiorproud girl to suppose that the moor zofloya is a slave in mind victoria repented her illtimed check she felt herself in the power of the moor while his manner at once proud and imperious carried with it an irresistible charm a somewhat that penetrated her heart and took from her the wish as well as the power to offer further reproof victoria resumed the moor remember that i have been thy willing instrument and that literally i have performed to thee the promises i made the heart of victoria did not assent she felt that his promises had been fallacious or indefinitely performed but still she forbore remark and he proceeded as though he understood her thoughts nam i to blame if circumstances operated to make my services unpropitious have i not sacrificed all future prospects to save thee from disgrace and accompany thee in thy flightthou canst not be displeased victoriaam i to blame for the unkindness of fortune the speciousness and futility of his arguments were sufficiently evident to victoria yet her soul involuntarily became softened graceful beauty shone conspicuous in the form of the moor and a fascinating sweetness dwelt on his features his resplendent yet tender beaming eyes sent their powerful softness through her bosom and her heart dissolved in willing pleasing delusion delighting to cherish while it felt its weakness a triumphant smile now lighted up the expressive countenance of the moor he took her hand and pressed it to his lips with haughty tenderness eyes too sure i feel cried victoria unable to contend with the emotions of her heartthat for thee zofloya i could at this moment resign the world nay life itselfyet my soul sickens at the prospect before mesay how long must we reside amid this savage condottieri yet awhile lovely victoriaand when thou quietest these solitudeshe pursued while his eyes sparkled with more than mortal firethen art thou minefor ever victoria ventured to look upon him but did not speak saywilt thou not be mine resumed zofloyayet why do i ask since there is no appeal for thee he added with a terrible smilethou in reality being mine alreadyas he concluded he grasped the hand which he held in his with violence a faint exclamation of pain escaped the lips of victoria but looking in his countenance illumined as it was with wild and singular expression she attributed his violence to uncontrollable ardour and only smiledthe moor seized her in his armsthen pushing her from him surveyed her from head to foot eyes yesthou wilt be mine he exclaimed sto all eternity some time had now elapsed since victoria had been the associate of banditti the vile and lawless outcasts of society her constant companion and presumed lover a vile moor introduced originally to her notice in a menial capacity banished from the world by her crimes and her vices and seeking in the depth of an almost unfathomable obscurity safety from the punishment their due such was now the situation of one whose early character and propensities naturally evil required in youth the strong curb of virtuous example to reprove and ultimately reform them maternal imprudence and maternal indiscretion by destroying the bonds of respect rendered abortive all future attempt to preserve from baleful example the hopeless victim of premature corruptionthus too noble emulation was perished and with the character became identified as cureless habits errors which time and strict education would have withered in the germ in moments of solitude which occurred but seldom the wretched victoria reflecting upon her early youth what she might have been and what she was cursed terrible to say the mother that first had weakly indulged and then by her own example tempted and destroyed her during the whole of the time that she had resided among the condottieri never once had she beheld the countenance of their chief </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> chief yet in her absence zofloya had said that he unmasked she hath a reason added he for concealing his features from you but time will developed all and then you will know it in manners however the haughty chief was considerably changeable seemed to have remarked and approved the terms on which victoria and the moor continued to live ever delicately respectful in his presence though incomparably tender at other times was the manner of zofloya towards herthe more distant indeed the more reserved and punctilious he appeared the more did the chief unbend and the more appear pleased but if by a word or even a look he expressed aught of tenderness or warmth then did he become agitated lay his hand upon his dagger or start uneasily from his chair in his voice there was a something that powerfully awakened the attention of victoriahis manner affected her less for its solemnity than for other reasons which she could not define and she would at times have given the universe for a glance at his features as for the mistress of the chief her manners underwent a considerable change she behaved to victoria with civility sometimes even with attention but at others particularly in the absence of the chief she would regard her with a look that wanted only the power of destroying the moor zofloya occasionally accompanied a chosen troop of the bandit in their adventurous excursions among the alps and victoria could not avoid observing that when he did so they were such generally as were esteemed most desperate and were most in repute for their ferocity and contempt of life such too as were considered by the rest capable of any enormity and troubled neither with the weakness of compassion qualms of conscience or a distaste to bloodshed they were in fact ruffians rather than robbers and the blood hounds of the bandthese zofloya chose to select when he went forth with any and unanimously they swore that when he was among them they felt impelled to deeds which otherwise would have remained unattempted one gloomy evening seated on the declivity of a mountain victoria reflected involuntarily upon this circumstance she loved yet trembled at the inscrutable zofloyabut lost and abandonedseeking an object to fix on she yielded without struggle to his fascinationsthat he loved her she believed yet such was the dignity sometimes haughty repulsiveness of his manners that even in his softest moods she watched the turning of his eye with secret dread fearing and dubious of what the next moment might produce never even had she been compleatly at ease with him there was always a proud reserve about him in the midst of his tendernesshis softness resembled more the condescension of a superior than the devotion of a lover strange mysterious being she mentally exclaimed thy looks thy words thine actions have ever to me been indefinable better ah better perhaps it were she added with a sigh that i had never known theeshe paused her ideas reverted to her past life she retraced its black and disastrous career hah mother mother she cried hall is attributable to thee why didst thou when in early youthwhen my passions were strong and my judgment weak why didst thou imprudently bring before my eyes scenes to inflame my soul and set my senses maddingit was thou first haughtiest me to put nor check nor restraint upon the incitements of unholy lovetwas thy example too which caused me to deem lightly of the marriage vowthy heart wandered from its allegiance to thy husband my heart wandered from minethy husband died through means of theemine died by poison which i administeredyet wherefore do i thus retrace she added casting herself upon the mountaindo i repent me of that which i have done noi regret only the state to which circumstances have reduced mewretch that i am zofloyaoh zofloya thou hast helped on my destructionyet am i now so bound so trammelled to thee by what magic arts i know not that though at this moment i feel strong wish to fly thee yet it is counteracted by conviction that the attempt is impossible she sighed deeply then in a mournful voice resumedhere must i wait thy coming for into the cavern i will not descend the gloomy silence of the chief oppresses my soul while the now cool now ferocious looks of his mistress throw my senses into confusion she remained still prostrate on the side of the mountain till wearied with grievous and unavailing reflection she closed her eyes by degrees sleep stole over her faculties and she dreamed that gliding lightly over the highest rocks she beheld a beautiful and seraphic form approachwhen it came near it seemed to her that her eyes could not sustain the exceeding brilliancy which shot from the countenance the hair and the garments of this celestial vision victoria it pronounced in a sweet and awful voice i am thy good genius i come to warn thee at this moment because it is the first for many years in which a spark of repentance hath visited thy guiltbenighted soulthe almighty who wishes to save his creatures from destruction permits that i appear before theeif thou wilt forsake even yet the dark and thorny path of sin if thou wilt endeavour by thy future life to make amends for the terrible list of the past even yet shalt thou be savedbut above all thou must fly the moor zofloya who is not what he seems at that instant victoria saw beneath the feet of the resplendent vision the moor zofloyahe lay prostratestripped of his gaudy habiliments and appearing monstrous and deformedstill she recognized him for zofloya attend pursued the angelfly immediately the false pretended moor and heaven will direct thy steps retire for a while from the worldlook into thine heartrepentand thy </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> thy sins shall be forgiven theeyet mark and loud thunder seemed to rattle from above if thou pursues thy present path speedy death and eternal destruction will be thine as the splendid form pronounced these words the earth opening at its feet shewed an immeasurable abyssdown headlong it spurned the moor who uttering terrific yells which echoed through the mountains sunk struggling from view the celestial vision ascended pointing as it rose its fair finger to heaventhe awful voice of the thunder solemnly soundedthe dazzled eyes of victoria beheld the heavens open as the spirit drew towards them the music of the spheres in loud choral harmony struck for an instant on her ravished ears her inwrought fancy could bear no more and she awoke opening her eyes she beheld that all around was still and gloomy yet so far was she still possessed by her dream that even yet she beheld a stream of radiance in the air and fancied she could identify that spot in the sky at which the angel entered its bright abode celestial shapes and sparkling corruptions still swam in her view and when she closed her eyes she saw them with encreased brilliancy in imaginations eye by degrees the vividness of these impressions subsided she felt ashamed to yield observance to a dream yet still her soul was touched but whither and how can i fly she criedyet destruction awaits me if i stayoh no it cannot beni will not yield thus to a vision frolic of the fancy let loose when the senses slumber and for that to quit zofloyaungrateful victoria no i feel i feel that to be impossible scarce had the unhappy victoria pronounced these words when darting from a cleft in the mountain the moor appeared before hereven through the dusky gloom victoria beheld the fire which sparkled in his eyes his whole figure seemed more proudly dignified more lofty than everif she hesitated before to adopt the conduct she was warned to pursue that hesitation now vanished she remembered her dream no longer the presence of zofloya put reflection and consideration to flighthe took her hand and in a gentle voice said you would not forsake me victoria victoria started for this remark implied a knowledge of her thoughts show is this zofloya she said and faintly smiled you seem to read your thoughts fair creature added the moorland have i not always read them true true said the embarrassed victoriabut how no matter cried the moor you are mine i have gained you and lose you now i neither can nor will you do not hate me victoria victoria replied not her thoughts were confused respecting the moor and again a sentiment of fear predominated over every other sensation come he resumed nothing checked by her silence come let us remain here no longer but return to our home it is more chearful than this gloom my victoria and will disperse thy melancholy he passed his arm gently round her waist and led her onthough her scruples ceased to occupy her her heart was oppressed and she could not speak in softest language the moor addressed her as they walked by degrees the sweet tones of his harmonious voice his honied flattery and soft attentions produced their wonted effectagain the changing victoria began to feel irresistibly rivetted to him and the more from the temporary gloom that had affected her in his absence wert thou always with me zofloya she at length said in a low voice as they approached the cavern black melancholy and gloomy visions would never agitate my soul zofloya pressed her hand while thou livest said he i will remain with theeand death shall have no power to tear thee from me they now entered the cave in the midst of a few straggling bandit sat the chief still masked with his bold companion by his side showily habited and looking the wild genius of the terrible abode the chief sat solemn and reserved listening rather than partaking in the conversation of his band some of them sat crosslegged some reclined taking over deeds of bloody outrage while the red firelight cast upon their marked features an additional tinge of ferocity victoria seated herself among them and the moor took his station beside her though at a respectful distance the chief looked towards them not unkindly but did not speak his fierce companion scowled upon victoria to whose features exercise and agitation had given an unusual brilliancythe look as usual caused a thousand dim remembrances to rush into the mind of victoriafor an instant she almost identified the countenance before her but at all events returned the malignant glance with visible contempt and indignation fire flashed from the eyes of the female she half rose but the chief who silently observed both caught her arm and restrained heron her seat at this instant three loud distinct knocks were heard outside the door one of the robbers started up and returned them on the inside with the hilt of his stiletto then founded without the loud shrill noise of the horn and the robber instantly touching a spring the door flew open several of the bandit entered in the midst of them was a female supported by and leaning on the arm of one of them her figure though faded was still beautiful her features were haggard and pale tears streamed down her cheeks and on her temple appeared a wound from whence the blood flowed over her bosom which was bare and cruelly bruised her long dark hair hung wild and dishevelled her clothes were torn to tatters and one fair arm gashed at the wrist hung useless by her side this miserable object was led or rather brought into the midst of the assembly the chief drew near and regarded her for a few moment with </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> with agitated but stedfast air then staggering back several paces he laid his hand upon his heart with convulsive emotion his it possible in a voice of smothered agony he cried hardly had he spoken when more of the band rushed in with daggers drawn in their right hands and securing with their left a man of tall majestic figure in whose countenance was discernible traces of the deepest rage and the most gloomy ferocityin an instant the attention of the chief was attracted towards him he gazed no longer on the pitiable object before him but approached with uneven pace the stranger thus forcibly securedscarce had he seemed to fix his eyes upon his countenance ere he recoiled horror struck then hastily returned and looked again as doubting the testimony of his senses now he appeared dreadfully convinced his whole frame trembled with violent emotionmadly impelled as it were he snatched the stiletto from his belt he rushed towards the unarmed stranger and tearing him from the grasp of the banditti with the strength of a raging lion he buried it to the hilt in his panting bosom at this the wounded female uttering a cry of horror sunk upon the floor but as if new strung by this very circumstance the chief with tenfold fury tore the reeking dagger from the breast of the stranger and plunged it unnumbered times in different parts of his bodythe band perceiving this unusual and sanguinary violence on the part of their chief and that he no longer required of them to secure the object of his rage resigned entirely the hold they had resumed and retired to a distance exhausted then by horrible and repeated wounds the stranger sunk down bathed in his blood the chief bent over him still gasping with unsated vengeance he knelt on his mangled form and with his left hand pinioned him to the earth then raising his dagger high transfixed it in the centre of his panting heart die infamous and thrice damned villain he cried in a tremendous voice thus diefor this moment i importuned incessantly just heavenward heaven in its justice has at length granted my prayeras he uttered these words he tore off his mask and throwing back his plumed helm victoria recognised her brother know wretched victoria he cried gazing full upon her with stern and piercing eyes dost thou know me and dost thou know the wretch who lies there weltering in his bloodhim who within this instant he exultingly cried has met by my hand the punishment his duedost thou not know him methinks unhappy girl thou shouldst rememberardolphthe vile ardolph the betrayer of thy miserable mother of that mother who now lies extended on the ground in the wretched person of that dying female victoria was on the point of speaking when leonardo rushing wildly towards the bleeding body of ardolph exclaimed with a convulsive laugh whatdid the wretch hope to escape for ever the vengeance of my soulvillain and coward he pursued spurning the body with his foot that put thy trust for safety in the weakness of my youthful armdidst thou believe it would remain for ever weakand that thy infamy would pass unpunishedto rob us of our mother to destroy our fatherland to blast forever the fair honor and the happiness of their childrenah villain and coward didst thou dare to hope that the young and boyish leonardo would forget thee no nohe whose soul could feel disgrace and injury sufficiently to fly the spot where it had overwhelmed his miserable family could never never forget the wretch who had caused itcould never forget those accursed features stamped in indelible characters upon his burning brainno no i tell theenor age nor time nor circumstances could hide thee with a veil so thick that outraged honor could not pierce ita venetians outraged honorfor this blessed hour my young heart pantedfor this my maturer feelings encreasing as i grew in bitter sense of the wrong done us and in desire of revenge longed with wilder enthusiasmfor this i implored heaven and heaven he cried falling on his knees while a fierce but noble enthusiasm burnt in his eyes heaven has listened to mefathermy injured fatherthy wrongs are avenged he smiled exultingly on the disfigured corpse of the once gay but now justly punished ardolph and arose from his knees at this moment the wretched laurina uttered a faint sigh leonardo started and appeared recalled to himself he clasped his hands and tears started to his eyes he approached his wretched mother and victoria followed between them they raised her in their arms leonardo turned fiercely towards the silent though surprised banditti who stood around and in an angry voice exclaimed which among ye have dared thus to maltreat a female not any of us in one voice answered the banditti show came she thus wounded once of the band stepped forward and replied we had wandered far and were returning homewards when loud shrieks from a distance first called out attentionwe turned again and hastened to the spot from whence they appeared to proceed there we discovered him who lies bleeding yonder cruelly beating this signoraon perceiving us he attempted to drag her forwardshe fell and cut her temple against the point of the rock on this he redoubled his blows and barbarously kicked herthe signora must have upon her head wounds more dangerous than that which is apparent we secured the inhuman signor however while some of our bravos seized the mules and baggage which were following at a distancethey could not retain possession however without encountering the servants and muleteers whom they soon routed some one way some anothers then no more cried the chief haughtily i have heard enough the offended bravo bit his lips and muttered somewhat between his teeth to zofloya who stood beside him </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> him and regarded him with an approving air whathow mayest thou villain exclaimed leonardo passionately i say we did our dutyand peacebase born ruffian cried the chief ill hear no more the vindictive bravo laid his hand upon his daggerthe action was not unnoted by leonardohe left the feeble laurina in the arms of victoria and rushing towards him with one blow levelled him to the earth insolent ruffian he cried nearest thou to rebel against thy chief lend me a dagger he called aloud nit shall drink his hearts blood seventy hands at once tendered their daggers leonardo seizing one brandished it for a moment over the prostrate robberthen seeming to consider the object unworthy checked his rage and bade him rise the wily robber rose upon his knees and crossing his arms upon his bosom declined his head in token of submission the chief threw the weapon from him with a smile of contempt thou art unworthy of death from my hand he cried arise reptile the robber rose on his feet and joined his comrades with a sullen air leonardo returned to his motherhe regarded her with an air of pity and supporting her in his arms brought her forward and offered wine to her lips the wretched laurina swallowed a little and it appeared to revive herleonardo then commanded that a bed should be prepared the very best that the cavern could afford when ready with his own hands he endeavoured to render it more commodious but still it was a sorry couch for one who had till now reposed on beds of down and made the grievous transition at a period like the present on this however her languid limbs were stretchedthe wounds on her head were bathed and her gashed wrist bound upall these tender offices were performed by leonardo while victoria stood silently by regarding her wretched mother with a stern unpitying air or wholly indifferent to what was passing conversed with zofloya in another part of the cavern at length the miserable laurina sunk into a slumber and leonardo quitting then her lowly couch rejoined his companions supper was prepared and while partaking of it those of the bandit that had been out detailed more at large the particulars of the evenings adventure little more of moment was however related than what the bravo had already specifiedstill leonardo listened with the deepest attention making however no comment while victoria terrible to say seemed to exult in the awful fate that had overtaken her deeply punished mother the wine passed briskly aboutthe banditti resigned themselves by degrees to the arms of sleep reclining round the expiring embers of the firevictoria retired to her usual place of rest while leonardo motioning his female companion to retire approached the uneasy pillow of his mother with intent to watch beside her during the night thus by the wonderful and inscrutable ways of providence were gathered together under the same roof those whose fates were so intimately connected with each other the one suffering under the dreadful visitation of her crimeher children under its fatal consequences while the infamous author of all had met unprepared the fate due to his guilt as to his barbarity towards the woman he had betrayed not long had the hapless laurina retained that unworthy love for which she had made such sacrificesthe injured loredani no moreher son leonardo fled no one knew whithervictoria eloped from the confinement in which she had been placedno further obstacles no further alarms to encounter the passion of the ungenerous ardolph cooled apace nought existing nought occurring to give it the required zest he began to regret that he had resigned his liberty for a woman whose almost constant melancholy damped his spirits or whose strained attempts at gaiety but reproached him for expecting the effort he became first indifferent to and at length even hated the wretched victim of his artifices he retained no longer traces of the fascinating elegant ardolph but degenerated gradually into the harsh and savage tyrantgrief had stolen the roses from the cheeks of laurina remorse had faded her graceful formshe was no longer an object of triumph or of envy to exhibit to the worthless ephemera of the day and she was reproached with her broken charms the gay the infamous seducer became weary of his acquisition by degrees he absented himself from her for lengthened periodsmirthful and joyous when away he returned to her gloomy and severenext frequent infidelities struck the barbed arrow of despised love into her soulbitter reproaches and at length personal ill treatment even to a degree of barbarity closed the list of her outrages and filled up the measure of her punishment and misery it was in these dreadful momentsor in those of cheerless solitudesmarting to agony beneath the pangs and indignities of brutal tyranny that the wretched laurina reflected upon her past conduct upon the husband and the children she had abandonedupon the husband the fond husband that for her had died upon her children hating her and flying from her presenceah terrible and severe must be the compunctious visiting of the mother who stepping aside from the path of honor and of virtue becomes amenable for the distraction and death of a doting husband for the crimes and miseries of her offspring a while faintly may you triumph sad daughter of infamy glitter awhile the vain and despised pageant of the hour but sportive is your ignoble glorybitter and permanent your punishment and regret among other vices resorted to by the vile ungrateful ardolph was that of deep play in this he engaged with a spirit of enterprize so hazardous and wild that his fortune became rapidly impoverishment was the conviction of this that determined him to quit venice and retire to switzerlandin haughty terms he expressed his intention to laurina and brutally added that his </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> his exile from the gay world would be pleasing if unaccompanied by her but the lost and broken hearted mourner replied not to the insinuationto accompany him she felt unavoidable for spite of his baseness spite of his inhumanity she loved him still on their journey notwithstanding he continued to treat her with the utmost harshness and severity not till the period of their encounter on the alps however with leonardos band had he resorted to personal ill usage thus did it happen that his aggravated crimes and cruelty caused him to rush upon his fatefor terror for her life excited by the violence of his blows extorted loud shrieks from the terrified laurina these shrieks attracted and guided the robbers to the spot the barbarian was immediately secured by russian less ferocious than himself and deservedly met his death by the hands of one on whom he had entailed misery and destruction such are the retribution of a just providence which though sometimes tardy are generally sure even in this world about noon the following day the wretched laurina who had not during the night nor till the present period uttered aught but incoherent exclamations appearing wholly unconscious and insensible to surrounding objectsopened her dim eyesthey fell first upon the countenance of victoria who happened to be standing near hershe gazed for a few momentary degrees weakened memory resumed its power she identified her daughter and faintly shriekedshe passed her feeble hand over her eyes then raised it trembling to heaven and extended it towards victoria daughterbeloved daughter in broken accents she saidby what chance do i behold theebut no matters have not time to askforgiveforgive me victoria answered not neither did she extend her handbut the soul of leonardo was more noblehe likewise stood beside the deathbed of his mother though she knew him nothe bent over her and took her feeble hand which had sunk again upon her miserable couch smother he cried glancing angrily towards the cruel victoria smother dost thou forget thy son leonardo the wretched parent turned upon him her heavy eyes nature spoke resistless in her bosom and in the strong marked features the muscular figure of the chief of a banditti she recognized the once delicate and blooming boy that she had nurtured in her bosom and an anguished sigh convulsed her heart soh god she murmured can this beand dost thou pardon me say dost thou whom i deserted and abandoned smother as i love and pardon thee may heaven look down and speak peace to thy soul soh my leonardothy nature was ever nobleraise me in thine armsbeloved injured sonraise me in thine arms ififthou greatest not pollution she added shuddering violently the cavern at this time contained only victoria and leonardoat the further end blazed a bright wood fire but still it served not wholly to reveal its gloomy expanse to the dim sight of the expiring laurina near her abject couch upon a fragment of stone serving for a table burned a lamp which shed its red rays full upon the objects near her and partially revealed the rude horrors by which her last moments were encompassed here plumed hats here stiletto swords and other instruments of murder hung around and there the spoils of the slain were scattered in lawless profusionthe body of the murdered ardolph had been removed and cast perhapsmeriting no other burial adown some measureless abyss but his unwashed blood still dyed in a dark red stream the flinty ground while his garments crimsoned over and pierced in unnumbered holes by the fierce dagger of the avenging leonardo remained awful mementos scattered near upon such a scene of massacre and confusion leonardo in her last moments raised his mother in his arms she gazed wildly roundabout at this fearful moment thoughts of higher import appeared to possess her soulher eyes reverted again towards her daughter who remained still standing beside her with folded arms and the stern countenance of a relentless fiend daughterin a hollow voice cried the dying mother clasping the weak hand which she could just move over that which was wounded and incapable of motion daughterthy dying mother prays to thee for pardonahlook not so unkindly upon herunbend those stern featureslet me not enter the presence of offended godunpitiedunforgiven by theedaughter i sayoh victoria a deep and shuddering sigh interrupted further utterance and she remained gasping in the arms of leonardo speakspeak to thy poor mother victoria cried the superior sould leonardo hast thou been in thine own conduct so faultless and so pure that thou shouldst deny to thy mother the assurance of love and pardon in an hour like this hahthat is the very point exclaimed victoria with a wild frightful laughthat which i have been my mother made memother she pursued addressing the anguished laurina why didst thou desert thy children to follow the seducer who hath justly rewarded theetis thou who hast caused my ruin on thy head therefore will my sins be numberedcan ioh can i reflect upon my deeds of horror without arraigning thee as the primary cause thou haughtiest me to give the reins to lawless passionfor that i dishonoured my husbandcaused the death of his brother and murdered a defenceless orphan for these crimesall all i say rising out of thy example i am now a despised exile in the midst of robbersof robbers of whom the noble son who supports thee in his arms is chief for this infamous abandoned girl exclaimed leonardo palsied be thy tongue canst thou wretch without one compunctious pang strew with sharp thorns the dying pillow of thy motherkneel monster of barbarity kneel and solicit heaven and her for pardon the fierce countenance of victoria relaxed into a smile of contempt and she remained immoveable laurina still gasped in the arms of her son convulsive shuddering seized her shattered frameher </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> frameher eyes fixed on leonardo beheld his noble features irradiated with filial love and tendernessin the agony of approaching death she could only grasp his hand but the grasp spoke eloquent to his heart the anguished gratitude which filled her ownonce more she turned her piteous looks upon victoria who unfeelingly regarded her pallid countenance rendered doubly pallid by the blood stained bandage which bound her wounded forehead but spoke not excess of agony pressed upon the burning brain of the wretched mother the pulsation of her breaking heart encreased to violencethen it nearly ceasedthe film of death crept over her eyes cold damps bedewed her brows and in accents scarcely articulate she murmured terribleyet just godoh pardon pardonmercy the last word quivered on her lips violent and universal convulsion seized for a moment her frameit was the last struggle of life with deaththe struggle ended life became extinct for ever when leonardo could no longer doubt that his mother had expired he reclined her gently upon the rugged pillow now no longer uneasy to the departed sufferer and kneeling beside her corpse pressed her cold hand to his lips and bedewed it with the heartwrung tears of bitterest anguish fool exclaimed victoria from the opposite side of the couchhow canst thou weakly lament over the death of one who hath made thee what thou now artthe vile chief of a band of robberslet the noble chief weep thenwell he may when he remembers that instead of being thus distinguished he should have figured the highest nobleman in venice base obdurate hearted wretch replied leonardo with dignity the vile chief of a band of robbers can lament at once over the errors and over the miserable fate of a misguided motherdeeply too deeply by the death bed thou hast given her independently of the punishment her errors have received hath she expiated the wretched delusion of the moment nor wholly on her abandoned girl dare to affix thy guilt and crimesfar far beyond what her example ever taught thee no victoria thy base mind was naturally evila mothers example might have checked thy depravity but could never have rendered thee virtuous but for her gloomily returned victoria the accursed pleasures of illicit love would never have tempted me to sinshe first corrupted and allured my mindher example opened wide the floodgates of passion in my soulfrom its resistless turbulence bearing down all before it first came my crimes if crimes they are andbut who art thou that presumes to reproach mewhy do i reply to theedidst thou not attempt to murder in his sleep the man who never injured theedidst thou not spill the blood of thy sisterdidst thou not forsake thy brokenhearted fatherland art thou not now an outcast of societys lawless captain of banditti lurking amid dreary mountains to seize as he passes the unwary travellers despoil him of his allperhaps to killno doubt many a precipice among these solitudes safe but for thee and thy horde hath received the frequent corse of the defenceless butchered victimno doubt babbling and aggravating fiend provoke me no further cried the enraged leonardo starting on his feet the horrible victoria burst into a loud laugh and flew to the extremity of the cavern leonardos blood boiled in his veins but he cast his eyes upon his mothers corpse her livid features which still wore the cast of anguish appealed to his heart they seemed to sayat such a moment forbear a sacred sentiment pervaded his bosom by a powerful effort conquering his indignation he wreaked not merited vengeance upon a wretch that he remembered was his sister but turning hastily away he cast himself across the couch of his mother and covered his face with his hands at this juncture the figure of zofloya presented itself to victoria at the entrance of the cavern he was unperceived by leonardo and beckoned to her with his finger she flew joyfully towards him the moor received her with a smile but strange meaning appeared on his features and he pressed his finger on his lip to enjoin her silence victoria spoke not for to zofloya she was all yielding and obedience he gently took her arm and led her from the cavern they proceeded in silence till they gained the mountain when zofloya desiring her to be seated on a rugged projection and taking his station beside her spoke thus victoria thy brother hath offended thee but ere long thy revenge will be completedost thou remember the bravo that he struck last night ginotti by namei stood beside him i remember him well answered victoria i stood beside himdidst thou mark i did bitter hate and thirst of vengeance instantly filled his bosom against thy brother at the first streak of dawn he stole from the cavern sleep had not closed his eyes during the night he went forthwith the resolution of hurling destruction upon the head of his chief and rather than not sacrifice him to his vengeance implicate the whole of his associates ere now he hath given information to the government of turin and betrayed the covered recess deemed without clue impenetrable at an early hour on the morrow savoys duke will have dispatched a considerable force to mount cenis the avenue from the cavern will be surrounded and for those within there will be no escapethy brother will fall perhaps the first and hand what will be my fate eagerly enquired victoria with her usual regard for self must i fall likewise zofloya have i forsaken thee yet sternly enquired the moor return without fear to the cavern even were the troops already within its walls i would rescue thee but wherefore return zofloya i will it so replied the moor ina loud voice learn to rely upon me even in the heart of dangernow let us converse no more he added </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> added in a softened voice upon this subject victoria durst not reply they continued wandering for a short time among the mountains zofloya then caused her to return to the cavern but to her infinite dismay did not himself follow at the usual hour still without having seen him she was compelled to retire to repose indifferent respecting the fate of others but tormented with selfish terrors for her own it was the hour of noon on the following day when leonardo who had never quitted the cavern since the death of his unfortunate mother heard the usual signals for entrance given without the band were not often in the habits of returning at this hour he therefore conceived that somewhat extraordinary must have occurred and hastened to give them entrance several of the robbers rushed tumultuously in with looks of horror and alarm we are lost they exclaimed in terrified accents we are betrayed our retreat is discoveredan armed force now hastens to surround the entrance to the cavern every avenue of escape will be blocked up such of our comrades as are out will stand no chance for they will be secured by innumerable soldiers awaiting them in ambush for ourselves our temporary security will be presently penetrated we shall all be sacrificed unless our captain can discover to us any secret paths by which we may find a passage under the mountains and evade our foes my brave comrades returned leonardo with a cool and dignified air if the case be such as you represent all is over with usi know of no secret paths leading from this cave nor do i believe there are any its own concealed and secret situation its openhanging portico and labyrinthian avenues having ever been deemed sufficient protectionmalice or treachery could alone have revealed usall i can recommend therefore is that we sell dearly our liberty and our lives and yield not an inch that is not purchased by blood while thus he spoke the signals from without were rapidly repeated some of our brave fellows have found means to elude the vigilance of the guards cried leonardoour signal is unknown to any but ourselveshaste and give them entranceperhaps they bring further intelligence at this time the cavern contained only an inconsiderable number of banditti their chief leonardo his mistress and victoria who sat beside her trembling with apprehension of danger and dismayed at the nonappearance of zofloya whom she began to fear intended to abandon her in the common ruin the order of leonardo was obeyed the signals were exchanged the door thrown open when in rushed to the horror of all a numerous band of armed soldiers headed and conducted by ginotti the dastard whom leonardo in momentary passion had struck surprized and shocked even the brave soul of the chief was dauntedthe soldiers hastened to surround him with the pride of genuine nobility he waved his hand and instinctively they fell back but a few moments signors he cried hand i am yoursfor in an instant he beheld that resistance against an host would be vaini would but speak he continued a few words to this female the companion of my fortunes then will i no longer claim your courtesy he approached his mistress who more surprized than intimidated remained sitting beside victoria megalina strozzi he exclaimed the name in a moment electrified victoriashe beheld herself seated next a dire foe surrounded by death and dangershe looked for zofloya he was no where to be seen and her soul shook within hershe sat in fearful silence listening to the words of leonardo megalina strozzi he cried again then lowering his voice he proceeded i will not reproach thee nowi will not tell thee that thy delusions misled my youthful mind or have ultimately caused my ruinno i will not tell thee so for the original cause lies deeper and more remotebut look aroundat this moment oh megalina i consider only the love that i have borne thee the years that we have been united that thou hast uniformly shared my perils and my miseriesand at the remembrance my soul freely pardons whatever evil thou hast caused meyet less lightly wilt thou be judged of by others and suffer common ignominy with the lowest of our banda disgraceful death i have security against that in an agitated but low voice interrupted megalina snatching a stiletto from her bosom ibut first thou infamous victoria who in the splendor of youth crossed my path and robbed me of a lover thus do i thank the fate which has thrown thee in my powerthen springing on the defenceless victoria she would have plunged the weapon in her bosom when suddenly between them stood the moor zofloya victoria is mine he cried in a voice of thunder fired to phrenzy megalina without further hesitation buried the dagger in her own breastthus leonardo she exclaimed i escape an ignominious death hand thus cried leonardo rushing upon ginotti and ere his intention could be surmised plunging a poignard in his heartthus do i reward a traitor and disappoint him of his expected triumph ginotti fell bathed in blood and uttering hideous imprecationsthe guards hastened to seize the frantic leonardo but breaking with the strength of madness from their grasp he fled to the extremity of the cavern and before he could be again secured had given himself repeated wounds with the poignard still reeking from the heart of the treacherous ginottifainting bleeding profusely he staggered and would have fallen the soldiers supported him in their arms and some attempted to staunch his wounds but even in the agonies of death he struggled furiously to prevent them crying out repeatedly in broken accents of frantic joy tis too latetis too late heaven be praisedhe endeavoured to dash himself upon the earth when finding he was forcibly restrained and that </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> that his strength failed him he rolled his wild eyes around as in contempt of their further power and resigning himself calmly into their arms expired with a smile of triumph on his features finding that the chief of the robbers had thus escaped them the soldiers hastened to secure with all possible diligence the remainder of the band some approached and offered to seize zofloya supposing him to be at least second in command soh we are lost whispered victoria to him in accents of alarm fear not softly returned the moor but accustom thyself to rely upon me wholly signors he cried addressing himself to the guards retire immediately from the caverns you persist in remaining evil must betide youyou impede my movements and will yourselves sufferhere is my dagger take it and be now convinced i meditate not to escape your hands by means of self destruction selfish terror or awe perhaps both acted involuntarily upon the minds of the soldiers and they retreated to a distance zofloya then passing his arm round the waist of victoria stepped back a few pacessuddenly a frightful noise like the rumbling of thunder was heard the cavern and even the mountain itself seemed to shake to the foundation huge pieces from the walls and from the roof became as it were forcibly disjointedthe soldiers frantic from terror no longer retained their hold of the banditti but rushed in one common croud towards the entrance of the cavern pressing tumultuously forward to escape as expecting to meet death at every footstep even victoria though supported by the arm of zofloya yielded to the terrible impressions excited by this scene of dismaythe reiterated shouts of the soldiery of nan explosion an explosion and the feeling she had of her own inevitable dangerher senses became overpowered confused horrors danced in her fight her eyes closed and unable to preserve her fleeting faculties she swooned on recovering she beheld herself in the midst of a spacious plain reclining in the arms of zofloya and encompassed by myriads of guardsshe gazed wildly aroundscarcely could she believe that still she existed soh zofloya zofloya she cried in a voice of horrorwhere are we no longer in the cavern but in a situation equally perilousoh dost thou not mean at last to preserve me from impending fatebehold how we are surroundedno hope of escapewould that like leonardo i had preserved myself from the ignominious death that too well i see awaits me wilt thou not trust to me then in a terrible voice cried the moori tell thee i can save thee from the fate thou dreadestthough surrounded by numbers we are beheld of noneswear then thou wilt confide in entrust me wholly and in an instant i bear thee from the midst of them soh i swear i swear cried the agonised victoria more swift than a point of time was the transitionshe beheld herself no longer in the midst of armed soldiers but on the summit of a mighty rock zofloya led her to its uttermost brink extreme terror filled the soul of victoria but she could not speakinvoluntarily she cast downwards her eyesa dizzying precipice that made the senses stagger yawned at her feet far far in its bottomless abyss battled the deafening cataract which from the summit of the adjacent rock tumbled a broad tremendous stream till broken midway in its course by some rude projection it divided into numberless dancing sprays and branches of foam uniting again at a considerable distance beneath and thundering as it fell with resistless fury down the rugged sides of the precipice whose hollow bosom sternly reechoed to the mighty sounds victoria trembled for the spirit of the beauteous lilla seemed to rise to her view from the depth of the frightful abyss mournful it appeared and mangled with many a woundvictoria remembered that for her she had felt no pity the images of the dying berenza of the destroyed henriquez glided before her on the rocky steepremorse filled her guilty soul but filled it too late for it came accompanied by despairin utterable anguish she gazed around and wildly clasped her hands know then victoria cried the moor but not in the gentle voice in which he had been wont to address hernow then thou art emancipated from falling ruins from hostile guards from fear of shame and an ignominious deathalready hast thou witnessed my power therefore thou knowest what i am capable ofi have watched thee followed thee and served thee until nowif then i save thee for ever from all future accidents all future worldly miseryall future disgrace saywilt thou for that future resign thyself entirely to me alas zofloya answered the terrified victoria nam i not already in thy powercan i chuse then but be thine no evasion woman sternly cried the moorno forced concessions hast thou not always promised to be mine have i ever he added in a softened voice have i ever availed myself till now of that promise which thou modestbut yet i cannot victoria compel thee nor so dearly do i covet thee will thy forced compliance satisfy mesay then at oncewilt thou unequivocally give thyself to me heart and body and soul soh yes yes for ever answered victoria rejoiced at even the semblance of returning softness in the moor in whose power she so completely beheld herselfoh yes for ever but rescue me i implore thee at once from this frightful situation and hereafter thou shalt dispose of me as thou wilttaunt meno more oh zofloya with hopes of safety and of peace for my soul grows sick within me at the view of surrounding horrors yet awhile fair victoriathou must first swear to abide by what thou hast now said i swear then answered the trembling victoria hand thou hast said it often rash girl replied the moor </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> moor bursting into a loud laugh and fixing on her his terrible eyes from whose fiery glances victoria turned enhorrorednay turn not away he tauntingly pursuedbut look again andsee to whom thou hast sworn victoria raised her eyeshorrible was the sight which met themno traces of the beautiful zofloya remainedbut in his place stripped as in her dream of his gaudy habiliments stood a figure fierce gigantic and hideous to behold terror and despair seized the soul of victoria she shrieked and would have fallen from the dizzying heighth had not his hand who appeared zofloya no longer seized her with a grasp of iron by the neck dost thou mark vain fool he cried in a terrific voice which drowned the thundering echo of the watersbehold me as i amno longer that which i appeared to be but the sworn enemy of all created nature by men calledsatantis i that lay in wait for frail humanitybut rare too rarely it is that by allurement or temptation i seduce them to my toilsfew venture far as thou hast ventured in the alarming paths of sinthy loose and evil thoughts first pointed thee out to my keen my searching view and attracted me towards thee in the eager hope of preyyes i it was that under semblance of the moorish slave supposed the recovered favorite of henriquezappeared to thee first in thy dreams luring thee to attempt the completion of thy wildest wishesi found thee oh of most exquisite willingness and yielding readily to all my temptationsbut what hast thou gained for i have deceived thee throughoutyet hast thou permitted thyself to be led alongthou hast damned thy soul with unnumbered crimes rendering thyself by each more fully minethou hast enjoyed no moment of peace nor even the smallest of those fruits for which thou wast reduced so deeply to sinthus hath my triumph been richly compleated thou art at once betrayed and cursed and the glory of thy utter destruction is minethus then with a terrible laugh he pursued thus do i now perform my promise to thee of saving from future worldly ill as he spoke he grasped more firmly the neck of the wretched victoriawith one push he whirled her headlong down the dreadful abysses she fell his loud demoniac laugh his yells of triumph echoed in her ears and a mangled corse she was received into the foaming waters below readerconsider not this as a romance merelyover their passions and their weaknesses mortals cannot keep a curb too strong the progress of vice is gradual and imperceptible and the arch enemy ever waits to take advantage of the failings of mankind whose destruction is his glory that his seductions may prevail we dare not doubt for can we otherwise account for those crimes dreadful and repugnant to nature which human beings are sometimes tempted to commit either we must suppose that the love of evil is born with us which would be an insult to the deity or we must attribute them as appears more consonant with reason to the suggestions of infernal influence </highSuspense3>
