<chapter>chapter i the lady isabel in an easychair of the spacious and handsome library of his townhouse sat william earl of mount severn his hair was gray the smoothness of his expansive brow was defaced by premature wrinkles and his once attractive face bore the pale unmistakable look of dissipation one of his feet was cased in folds of linen as it rested on the soft velvet ottoman speaking of gout as plainly as any foot ever spoke yet it would seemto look at the man as he sat therethat he had grown old before his time and so he had his years were barely nine and forty yet in all save years he was an aged man a noted character had been the earl of mount severn not that he had been a renowned politician or a great general or an eminent statesman or even an active member in the upper house not for any of these had the earls name been in the mouths of men but for the most reckless among the reckless for the spendthrift among spendthrifts for the gamester above all gamesters and for a gay man outstripping the gayby these characteristics did the world know lord mount severn it was said his faults were those of his head that a better heart or a more generous spirit never beat in human form and there was much truth in this it had been well for him had he lived and died plain william vane up to his five and twentieth year he had been industrious and steady had kept his terms in the temple and studied late and early the sober application of william vane had been a by word with the embryo barristers around judge vane they ironically called him and they strove ineffectually to allure him away to idleness and pleasure but young vane was ambitious and he knew that on his own talents and exertions must depend his own rising in the world he was of excellent family but poor counting a relative in the old earl of mount severn the possibility of his succeeding to the earldom never occurred to him for three healthy lives two of them young stood between him and the title yet those have died off one of apoplexy one of fever in africa the third boating at oxford and the young temple student william vane suddenly found himself earl of mount severn and the lawful possessor of sixty thousand a year his first idea was that he should never be able to spend the money that such a sum year by year could not be spent it was a wonder his head was not turned by adulation at the onset for he was courted flattered and caressed by all classes from a royal duke downward he became the most attractive man of his day the lion in society for independent of his newlyacquired wealth and title he was of distinguished appearance and fascinating manners but unfortunately the prudence which had sustained william vane the poor law student in his solitary temple chambers entirely forsook william vane the young earl of mount severn and he commenced his career on a scale of speed so great that all staid people said he was going to ruin and the deuce headlong but a peer of the realm and one whose rentroll is sixty thousand per annum does not go to ruin in a day there sat the earl in his library now in his nineandfortieth year and ruin had not come yetthat is it had not overwhelmed him but the embarrassments which had clung to him and been the destruction of his tranquility the bane of his existence who shall describe them the public knew them pretty well his private friends knew better his creditors best but none save himself knew or could ever know the worrying torment that was his portion wellnigh driving him to distraction years ago by dint of looking things steadily in the face and by economizing he might have retrieved his position but he had done what most people do in such casesput off the evil day sine die and gone on increasing his enormous list of debts the hour of exposure and ruin was now advancing fast perhaps the earl himself was thinking so as he sat there before an enormous mass of papers which strewed the library table his thoughts were back in the past that was a foolish match of his that gretna green match for love foolish so far as prudence went but the countess had been an affectionate wife to him had borne with his follies and his neglect had been an admirable mother to their only child one child alone had been theirs and in her thirteenth year the countess had died if they had but been blessed with a sonthe earl moaned over the longcontinued disappointment stillhe might have seen a way out of his difficulties the boy as soon as he was of age would have joined with him in cutting off the entail and my lord said a servant entering the room and interrupting the earls castles in the air a gentleman is asking to see you who cried the earl sharply not perceiving the card the man was bringing no unknown person although wearing the externals of a foreign ambassador was ever admitted unceremoniously to the presence of lord mount severn years of duns had taught the servants caution his card is here my lord it is mr carlyle of west lynne mr carlyle of west lynne groaned the earl whose foot just then had an awful twinge what does he want show him up the servant did as he was bid and introduced mr carlyle look at the visitor well reader for he will play his part in this history he was a very tall man of seven and twenty of remarkably noble presence he was somewhat given to stooping his head when he spoke to any one shorter than himself it was a peculiar habit almost to be called a bowing habit and his father had possessed it before </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> before him when told of it he would laugh and say he was unconscious of doing it his features were good his complexion was pale and clear his hair dark and his full eyelids drooped over his deep gray eyes altogether it was a countenance that both men and women liked to look uponthe index of an honorable sincere naturenot that it would have been called a handsome face so much as a pleasing and a distinguished one though but the son of a country lawyer and destined to be a lawyer himself he had received the training of a gentleman had been educated at rugby and taken his degree at oxford he advanced at once to the earl in the straightforward way of a man of businessof a man who has come on business mr carlyle said the latter holding out his handhe was always deemed the most affable peer of the agei am happy to see you you perceive i cannot rise at least without great pain and inconvenience my enemy the gout has possession of me again take a seat are you staying in town i have just arrived from west lynne the chief object of my journey was to see your lordship what can i do for you asked the earl uneasily for a suspicion had crossed his mind that mr carlyle might be acting for some one of his many troublesome creditors mr carlyle drew his chair nearer to the earl and spoke in a low tone a rumor came to my ears my lord that east lynne was in the market a moment sir exclaimed the earl with reserve not to say hauteur in his tone for his suspicions were gaining ground are we to converse confidentially together as men of honor or is there something concealed behind i do not understand you said mr carlyle in a wordexcuse my speaking plainly but i must feel my groundare you here on the part of some of my rascally creditors to pump information out of me that otherwise they would not get my lord uttered the visitor i should be incapable of so dishonorable an action i know that a lawyer gets credit for possessing but lax notions on the score of honor but you can scarcely suspect that i should be guilty of underhand work toward you i never was guilty of a mean trick in my life to my recollection and i do not think i ever shall be pardon me mr carlyle if you knew half the tricks and ruses played upon me you would not wonder at my suspecting all the world proceed with your business i heard that east lynne was for private sale your agent dropped half a word to me in confidence if so i should wish to be the purchaser for whom inquired the earl myself you laughed the earl egad lawyering cant be such bad work carlyle nor is it rejoined mr carlyle with an extensive firstclass connection such as ours but you must remember that a good fortune was left me by my uncle and a large one by my father i know the proceeds of lawyering also not altogether my mother brought a fortune on her marriage and it enabled my father to speculate successfully i have been looking out for an eligible property to invest my money upon and east lynne will suit me well provided i can have the refusal of it and we can agree about the terms lord mount severn mused for a few moments before he spoke mr carlyle he began my affairs are very bad and ready money i must find somewhere now east lynne is not entailed neither is it mortgaged to anything like its value though the latter fact as you may imagine is not patent to the world when i bought it at a bargain eighteen years ago you were the lawyer on the other side i remember my father smiled mr carlyle i was a child at the time of course i ought to have said your father by selling east lynne a few thousands will come into my hands after claims on it are settled i have no other means of raising the wind and that is why i have resolved to part with it but now understand if it were known abroad that east lynne is going from me i should have a hornets nest about my ears so that it must be disposed of privately do you comprehend perfectly replied mr carlyle i would as soon you bought it as anyone else if as you say we can agree about terms what does your lordship expect for itat a rough estimate for particulars i must refer you to my men of business warburton ware not less than seventy thousand pounds too much my lord cried mr carlyle decisively and thats not its value returned the earl these forced sales never do fetch their value answered the plainspeaking lawyer until this hint was given me by beauchamp i had thought east lynne was settled upon your lordships daughter theres nothing settled on her rejoined the earl the contraction on his brow standing out more plainly that comes of your thoughtless runaway marriages i fell in love with general conways daughter and she ran away with me like a fool that is we were both fools together for our pains the general objected to me and said i must sow my wild oats before he would give me mary so i took her to gretna green and she became countess of mount severn without a settlement it was an unfortunate affair taking one thing with another when her elopement was made known to the general it killed him killed him interrupted mr carlyle it did he had disease of the heart and the excitement brought on the crisis my poor wife never was happy from that hour she blamed herself for her fathers death and i believe it led to her own she was ill for years the doctors called it consumption but it was more like a wasting insensibly away and consumption never had been in her family no luck ever attends runaway marriages i have noticed it since in many many instances something bad is sure to turn up from it there might have been a settlement executed after the marriage observed mr carlyle for the earl had stopped and seemed lost in thought i know there might but there was not my wife had possessed no fortune i was already deep in my career of extravagance and neither of us thought of making provision for our future children or if we thought of it we did not do it there is an old saying mr carlyle that what may be done at any time is never done mr carlyle bowed so my child is portionless resumed the earl with a suppressed sigh the thought that it may be an embarrassing thing for her were i to die before she is settled in life crosses my mind when i am in a serious mood that she will marry well there is little doubt for she possesses beauty in a rare degree and has been reared as an english girl should be not to frivolity and foppery she was trained by her mother who save for the mad act she was persuaded into by me was all goodness and refinement for the first twelve years of her life and since then by an admirable governess no fear that she will be decamping to gretna green she was a very lovely child observed the lawyer i remember that ay you have seen her at east lynne in her mothers lifetime but to return to business if you become the purchaser of the east lynne estate mr carlyle it must be under the rose the money that it brings after paying off the mortgage i must have as i tell you for my private use and you know i should not be able to touch a farthing of it if the confounded public got an inkling of the transfer in the eyes of the world the proprietor of east lynne must be lord mount severnat least for some little time afterwards perhaps you will not object to that mr carlyle considered before replying and then the conversation was resumed when it was decided that he should see warburton and ware the first thing in the morning and confer with them it was growing late when he rose to leave stay and dine with me said the earl mr carlyle hesitated and looked down at his dressa plain gentlemanly morning attire but certainly not a dinner costume for a peers table oh thats nothing said the earl we shall be quite alone except my daughter mrs vane of castle marling is staying with us she came up to present my child at the last drawingroom but i think i heard something about her dining out today if not we will have it by ourselves here oblige me by touching the bell mr carlyle the servant entered inquire whether mrs vane dines at home said the earl mrs vane dines out my lord was the mans immediate reply the carriage is at the door now very well mr carlyle remains at seven oclock the dinner was announced and the earl wheeled into the adjoining room as he and mr carlyle entered it at one door some one else came in by the opposite one whowhatwas it mr carlyle looked not quite sure whether it was a human beinghe almost thought it more like an angel a light graceful girlish form a face of surpassing beauty beauty that is rarely seen save from the imagination of a painter dark shining curls falling on her neck and shoulders smooth as a childs fair delicate arms decorated with pearls and a flowing dress of costly white lace altogether the vision did indeed look to the lawyer as one from a fairer world than this my daughter mr carlyle the lady isabel they took their seats at the table lord mount severn at its head in spite of his gout and his footstool and the young lady and mr carlyle opposite each other mr carlyle had not deemed himself a particular admirer of womens beauty but the extraordinary loveliness of the young girl before him nearly took away his senses and his selfpossession yet it was not so much the perfect contour or the exquisite features that struck him or the rich damask of the delicate cheek or the luxuriant falling hair no it was the sweet expression of the soft dark eyes never in his life had he seen eyes so pleasing he could not keep his gaze from her and he became conscious as he grew more familiar with her face that there was in its character a sad sorrowful look only at times was it to be noticed when the features were at repose and it lay chiefly in the very eyes he was admiring never does this unconsciously mournful expression exist but it is a sure index of sorrow and suffering but mr carlyle understood it not and who could connect sorrow with the anticipated brilliant future of isabel vane isabel observed the earl you are dressed yes papa not to keep old mrs levison waiting tea she likes to take it early and i know mrs vane must have kept her waiting dinner it was halfpast six when she drove from here i hope you will not be late tonight isabel it depends upon mrs vane then i am sure you will be when the young ladies in this fashionable world of ours turn night into day it is a bad thing for their roses what say you mr carlyle mr carlyle glanced at the roses on the cheeks opposite to him they looked too fresh and bright to fade lightly at the conclusion of dinner a maid entered the room with a white cashmere mantle placing it over the shoulders of her young lady as she said the carriage was waiting lady isabel advanced to the earl goodbye papa goodnight my love he answered drawing her toward him and kissing her sweet face tell mrs vane i will not have </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> have you kept out till morning hours you are but a child yet mr carlyle will you ring i am debarred from seeing my daughter to the carriage if your lordship will allow meif lady isabel will pardon the attendance of one little used to wait upon young ladies i shall be proud to see her to her carriage was the somewhat confused answer of mr carlyle as he touched the bell the earl thanked him and the young lady smiled and mr carlyle conducted her down the broad lighted staircase and stood bareheaded by the door of the luxurious chariot and handed her in she put out her hand in her frank pleasant manner as she wished him good night the carriage rolled on its way and mr carlyle returned to the earl well is she not a handsome girl he demanded handsome is not the word for beauty such as hers was mr carlyles reply in a low warm tone i never saw a face half so beautiful she caused quite a sensation at the drawingroom last weekas i hear this everlasting gout kept me indoors all day and she is as good as she is beautiful the earl was not partial lady isabel was wondrously gifted by nature not only in mind and person but in heart she was as little like a fashionable young lady as it was well possible to be partly because she had hitherto been secluded from the great world partly from the care bestowed upon her training during the lifetime of her mother she had lived occasionally at east lynne but mostly at a larger seat of the earls in wales mount severn since her mothers death she had remained entirely at mount severn under the charge of a judicious governess a very small establishment being kept for them and the earl paying them impromptu and flying visits generous and benevolent she was timid and sensitive to a degree gentle and considerate to all do not cavil at her being thus praisedadmire and love her whilst you may she is worthy of it now in her innocent girlhood the time will come when such praise would be misplaced could the fate that was to overtake his child have been foreseen by the earl he would have struck her down to death in his love as she stood before him rather than suffer her to enter upon it </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ii the broken cross lady isabels carriage continued its way and deposited her at the residence of mrs levison mrs levison was nearly eighty years of age and very severe in speech and manner or as mrs vane expressed it crabbed she looked the image of impatience when isabel entered with her cap pushed all awry and pulling at the black satin gown for mrs vane had kept her waiting dinner and isabel was keeping her from her tea and that does not agree with the aged with their health or with their temper i fear i am late exclaimed lady isabel as she advanced to mrs levison but a gentleman dined with papa today and it made us rather longer at table you are twentyfive minutes behind your time cried the old lady sharply and i want my tea emma order it in mrs vane rang the bell and did as she was bid she was a little woman of sixandtwenty very plain in face but elegant in figure very accomplished and vain to her fingers ends her mother who was dead had been mrs levisons daughter and her husband raymond vane was presumptive heir to the earldom of mount severn wont you take that tippet off child asked mrs levison who knew nothing of the newfashioned names for such articles mantles burnous and all the string of them and isabel threw it off and sat down by her the tea is not made grandmamma exclaimed mrs vane in an accent of astonishment as the servant appeared with the tray and the silver urn you surely do not have it made in the room where should i have it made inquired mrs levison it is much more convenient to have it brought in ready made said mrs vane i dislike the embarass of making it indeed was the reply of the old lady and get it slopped over in the saucers and as cold as milk you always were lazy emmaand given to use those french words id rather stick a printed label on my forehead for my part i speak french and let the world know it in that way who makes tea for you in general asked mrs vane telegraphing a contemptuous glance to isabel behind her grandmother but the eyes of lady isabel fell timidly and a blush rose to her cheeks she did not like to appear to differ from mrs vane her senior and her fathers guest but her mind revolted at the bare idea of ingratitude or ridicule cast on an aged parent harriet comes in and makes it for me replied mrs levison aye and sits down and takes it with me when i am alone which is pretty often what do you say to that madame emmayou with your fine notions just as you please of course grandmamma and theres the teacaddy at your elbow and the urns fizzing away and if we are to have any tea tonight it had better be made i dont know how much to put in grumbled mrs vane who had the greatest horror of soiling her hands or her gloves who in short had a particular antipathy to doing anything useful shall i make it dear mrs levison said isabel rising with alacrity i had used to make it quite as often as my governess at mount severn and i make it for papa do child replied the old lady you are worth ten of her isabel laughed merrily drew off her gloves and sat down to the table and at that moment a young and elegant man lounged into the room he was deemed handsome with his clearlycut features his dark eyes his raven hair and his white teeth but to a keen observer those features had not an attractive expression and the dark eyes had a great knack of looking away while he spoke to you it was francis captain levison he was grandson to the old lady and first cousin to mrs vane few men were so fascinating in manners at times and seasons in face and in form few men won so completely upon their hearers ears and few were so heartless in their hearts of hearts the world courted him and society honored him for though he was a graceless spendthrift and it was known that he was he was the presumptive heir to the old and rich sir peter levison the ancient lady spoke up captain levison lady isabel vane they both acknowledged the introduction and isabel a child yet in the ways of the world flushed crimson at the admiring looks cast upon her by the young guardsman strangestrange that she should make the acquaintance of these two men in the same day almost in the same hour the two of all the human race who were to exercise so powerful an influence over her future life thats a pretty cross child cried mrs levison as isabel stood by her when tea was over and she and mrs vane were about to depart on their evening visit she alluded to a golden cross set with seven emeralds which isabel wore on her neck it was of light delicate texture and was suspended from a thin short gold chain is it not pretty answered isabel it was given me by my dear mamma just before she died stay i will take it off for you i only wear it upon great occasions this her first appearance at the grand dukes seemed a very great occasion to the simplyreared and inexperienced girl she unclasped the chain and placed it with the cross in the hands of mrs levison why i declare you have nothing on but that cross and some rubbishing pearl bracelets uttered mrs vane to isabel i did not look at you before mamma gave me both the bracelets are those she used frequently to wear you oldfashioned child because your mamma wore those bracelets years ago is that a reason for your doing so retorted mrs vane why did you not put on your diamonds ididput on my diamonds but itook them off again stammered isabel what on earth for i did not like to look too fine answered isabel with a laugh and a blush they glittered so i feared it might be thought i had put them on to look fine ah i see you mean to set up in that class of people who pretend to despise ornaments scornfully remarked mrs vane it is the refinement of affectation lady isabel the sneer fell harmlessly on lady isabels ear she only believed something had put mrs vane out of temper it certainly had and that something though isabel little suspected it was the evident admiration captain levison evinced for her fresh young beauty it quite absorbed him and rendered him neglectful even of mrs vane here child take your cross said the old lady it is very pretty prettier on your neck than diamonds would be you dont want embellishing never mind what emma says francis levison took the cross and chain from her hand to pass them to lady isabel whether he was awkward or whether her hands were full for she held her gloves her handkerchief and had just taken up her mantle certain it is that it fell and the gentleman in his too quick effort to regain it managed to set his foot upon it and the cross was broken in two there now whose fault was that cried mrs levison isabel did not answer her heart was very full she took the broken cross and the tears dropped from her eyes she could not help it why you are never crying over a stupid bauble of a cross uttered mrs vane interrupting captain levisons expression of regret at his awkwardness you can have it mended dear interposed mrs levison lady isabel chased away the tears and turned to captain levison with a cheerful look pray do not blame yourself she goodnaturedly said the fault was as much mine as yours and as mrs levison says i can get it mended she disengaged the upper part of the cross from the chain as she spoke and clasped the latter round her throat you will not go with that thin string of gold on and nothing else uttered mrs vane why not returned isabel if people say anything i can tell them an accident happened to the cross mrs vane burst into a laugh of mocking ridicule if people say anything she repeated in a tone according with the laugh they are not likely to say anything but they will deem lord mount severns daughter unfortunately short of jewellery isabel smiled and shook her head they saw my diamonds at the drawingroom if you had done such an awkward thing for me frank levison burst forth the old lady my doors should have been closed against you for a month there if you are to go emma you had better go dancing off to begin an evening at ten oclock at night in my time we used to go at seven but its the custom now to turn night into day when george the third dined at one oclock upon boiled mutton and turnips put in the graceless captain who certainly held his grandmother in no greater reverence than did mrs vane he turned to isabel as he spoke to hand her downstairs thus she was conducted to her carriage the second time that night by a stranger mrs vane got down by herself as she best could and her temper was not improved by the process goodnight said she to the captain i shall not say goodnight you will find me there almost as soon as you you told me you were not coming some bachelors party in the way yes but i have changed my mind farewell for the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> the present lady isabel what an object you will look with nothing on your neck but a schoolgirls chain began mrs vane returning to the grievance as the carriage drove on oh mrs vane what does it signify i can only think of my broken cross i am sure it must be an evil omen an evilwhat an evil omen mamma gave me that cross when she was dying she told me to let it be to me as a talisman always to keep it safely and when i was in any distress or in need of counsel to look at it and strive to recall what her advice would be and to act accordingly and now it is brokenbroken a glaring gaslight flashed into the carriage right into the face of isabel i declare uttered mrs vane you are crying again i tell you what it is isabel i am not going to chaperone red eyes to the duchess of dartfords so if you cant put a stop to this i shall order the carriage home and go on alone isabel meekly dried her eyes sighing deeply as she did so i can have the pieces joined i dare say but it will never be the same cross to me again what have you done with the pieces irascibly asked mrs vane i folded them in the thin paper mrs levison gave me and put it inside my frock here it is touching the body i have no pocket on mrs vane gave vent to a groan she never had been a girl herselfshe had been a woman at ten and she complimented isabel upon being little better than an imbecile put it inside my frock she uttered in a torrent of scorn and you eighteen years of age i fancied you left off frocks when you left the nursery for shame isabel i meant to say my dress corrected isabel meant to say you are a baby idiot was the inward comment of mrs vane a few minutes and isabel forgot her grievance the brilliant rooms were to her as an enchanting scene of dreamland for her heart was in its springtide of early freshness and the satiety of experience had not come how could she remember trouble even the broken cross as she bent to the homage offered her and drank in the honeyed words poured forth into her ear halloo cried an oxford student with a long rentroll in prospective who was screwing himself against the wall not to be in the way of the waltzers i thought you had given up coming to these places so i had replied the fast nobleman addressed the son of a marquis but i am on the lookout so am forced into them again i think a ballroom the greatest bore in life on the lookout for what for a wife my governor has stopped supplies and has vowed by his beard not to advance another shilling or pay a debt till i reform as a preliminary step toward it he insists upon a wife and i am trying to choose one for i am deeper in debt than you imagine take the new beauty then who is she lady isabel vane much obliged for the suggestion replied the earl but one likes a respectable fatherinlaw and mount severn is going to smash he and i are too much in the same line and might clash in the long run one cant have everything the girls beauty is beyond common i saw that rake levison make up to her he fancies he can carry all before him where women are concerned so he does often was his quiet reply i hate the fellow he thinks so much of himself with his curled hair and shining teeth and his white skin and hes as heartless as an owl what was that hushedup business about miss charteris whos to know levison slipped out of the escapade like an eel and the woman protested that he was more sinned against than sinning threefourths of the world believed them and she went abroad and died and levison here he comes and mount severns daughter with him they were approaching at that moment francis levison and lady isabel he was expressing his regret at the untoward accident of the cross for the tenth time that night i feel that it can never be atoned for whispered he that the heartfelt homage of my whole life would not be sufficient compensation he spoke in a tone of thrilling gentleness gratifying to the ear but dangerous to the heart lady isabel glanced up and caught his eyes gazing upon her with the deepest tendernessa language hers had never yet encountered a vivid blush again arose to her cheek her eyelids fell and her timid words died away in silence take care take care my young lady isabel murmured the oxonian under his breath as they passed him that man is as false as he is fair i think he is a rascal remarked the earl i know he is i know a thing or two about him he would ruin her heart for the renown of the exploit because shes a beauty and then fling it away broken he has none to give in return for the gift just as much as my new racehorse has concluded the earl she is very beautiful </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iii barbara hare west lynne was a town of some importance particularly in its own eyes though being neither a manufacturing one nor a cathedral one nor even the chief town of the county it was somewhat primitive in its manners and customs passing out at the town toward the east you came upon several detached gentlemans houses in the vicinity of which stood the church of st jude which was more aristocratic in the matter of its congregation than the other churches of west lynne for about a mile these houses were scattered the church being situated at their commencement close to that busy part of the place and about a mile further on you came upon the beautiful estate which was called east lynne between the gentlemens houses mentioned and east lynne the mile of road was very solitary being much overshadowed with trees one house alone stood there and that was about threequarters of a mile before you came to east lynne it was on the left hand side a square ugly red brick house with a weathercock on the top standing some little distance from the road a flat lawn extended before it and close to the palings which divided it from the road was a grove of trees some yards in depth the lawn was divided by a narrow middle gravel path to which you gained access from the portico of the house you entered upon a large flagged hall with a reception room on either hand and the staircase a wide one facing you by the side of the staircase you passed on to the servants apartments and offices that place was called the grove and was the property and residence of richard hare esq commonly called mr justice hare the room to the left hand as you went in was the general sittingroom the other was very much kept boxed up in lavender and brown holland to be opened on state occasions justice and mrs hare had three children a son and two daughters annie was the elder of the girls and had married young barbara the younger was now nineteen and richard the eldestbut we shall come to him hereafter in this sittingroom on a chilly evening early in may a few days subsequent to that which had witnessed the visit of mr carlyle to the earl of mount severn sat mrs hare a pale delicate woman buried in shawls and cushions but the day had been warm at the window sat a pretty girl very fair with blue eyes light hair a bright complexion and small aquiline features she was listlessly turning over the leaves of a book barbara i am sure it must be teatime now the time seems to move slowly with you mamma it is scarcely a quarter of an hour since i told you it was but ten minutes past six i am so thirsty announced the poor invalid do go and look at the clock again barbara barbara hare rose with a gesture of impatience not suppressed opened the door and glanced at the large clock in the hall it wants nine and twenty minutes to seven mamma i wish you would put your watch on of a day four times you have sent me to look at that clock since dinner i am so thirsty repeated mrs hare with a sort of sob if seven oclock would but strike i am dying for my tea it may occur to the reader that a lady in her own house dying for her tea might surely order it brought in although the customary hour had not struck not so mrs hare since her husband had first brought her home to that house four and twentyyears ago she had never dared to express a will in it scarcely on her own responsibility to give an order justice hare was stern imperative obstinate and selfconceited she timid gentle and submissive she had loved him with all her heart and her life had been one long yielding of her will to his in fact she had no will his was all in all far was she from feeling the servitude a yoke some natures do not and to do mr hare justice his powerful will that must bear down all before it was in fault not his kindness he never meant to be unkind to his wife of his three children barbara alone had inherited his will barbara began mrs hare again when she thought another quarter of an hour at least must have elapsed well mamma ring and tell them to be getting it in readiness so that when seven strikes there may be no delay goodness mamma you know they do always have it ready and theres no such hurry for papa may not be at home but she rose and rang the bell with a petulant motion and when the man answered it told him to have tea in to its time if you knew dear how dry my throat is how parched my mouth you would have more patience with me barbara closed her book with a listless air and turned listlessly to the window she seemed tired not with fatigue but with what the french express by the word ennui here comes papa she presently said oh i am so glad cried poor mrs hare perhaps he will not mind having the tea in at once if i told him how thirsty i am the justice came in a middle sized man with pompous features and a pompous walk and a flaxen wig in his aquiline nose compressed lips and pointed chin might be traced a resemblance to his daughter though he never could have been half so goodlooking as was pretty barbara richard spoke up mrs hare from between her shawls the instant he opened the door well would you please let me have tea in now would you very much mind taking it a little earlier this evening i am feverish again and my tongue is so parched i dont know how to speak oh its near seven you wont have long to wait with this exceedingly gracious answer to an invalids request mr hare quitted the room again and banged the door he had not spoken unkindly or roughly simply with indifference but ere mrs hares meek sigh of disappointment was over the door reopened and the flaxen wig was thrust in again i dont mind if i do have it now it will be a fine moonlight night and i am going with pinner as far as beauchamps to smoke a pipe order it in barbara the tea was made and partaken of and the justice departed for mr beauchamps squire pinner calling for him at the gate mr beauchamp was a gentleman who farmed a great deal of land and who was also lord mount severns agent or </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> or steward for east lynne he lived higher up the road some little distance beyond east lynne i am so cold barbara shivered mrs hare as she watched the justice down the gravel path i wonder if your papa would say it was foolish of me if i told them to light a bit of fire have it lighted if you like responded barbara ringing the bell papa will know nothing about it one way or the other for he wont be home till after bedtime jasper mamma is cold and would like a fire lighted plenty of sticks jasper that it may burn up quickly said mrs hare in a pleading voice as if the sticks were jaspers and not hers mrs hare got her fire and she drew her chair in front and put her feet on the fender to catch its warmth barbara listless still went into the hall took a woolen shawl from the stand there threw it over her shoulders and went out she strolled down the straight formal path and stood at the iron gate looking over it into the public road not very public in that spot and at that hour but as lonely as one could wish the night was calm and pleasant though somewhat chilly for the beginning of may and the moon was getting high in the sky when will he come home she murmured as she leaned her head upon the gate oh what would life be like without him how miserable these few days have been i wonder what took him there i wonder what is detaining him corny said he was only gone for a day the faint echo of footsteps in the distance stole upon her ear and barbara drew a little back and hid herself under the shelter of the trees not choosing to be seen by any stray passerby but as they drew near a sudden change came over her her eyes lighted up her cheeks were dyed with crimson and her veins tingled with excess of rapturefor she knew those footsteps and loved them only too well cautiously peeping over the gate again she looked down the road a tall form whose very height and strength bore a grace of which its owner was unconscious was advancing rapidly toward her from the direction of west lynne again she shrank away true love is ever timid and whatever may have been barbara hares other qualities her love at least was true and deep but instead of the gate opening with the firm quick motion peculiar to the hand which guided it the footsteps seemed to pass and not to have turned at all toward it barbaras heart sank and she stole to the gate again and looked out with a yearning look yes sure enough he was striding on not thinking of her not coming to her and she in the disappointment and impulse of the moment called to him archibald mr carlyleit was no otherturned on his heel and approached the gate is it you barbara watching for thieves and poachers how are you how are you she returned holding the gate open for him to enter as he shook hands and striving to calm down her agitation when did you return only now by the eight oclock train which got in beyond its time having drawled unpardonably at the stations they little thought they had me in it as their looks betrayed when i got out i have not been home yet no what will cornelia say i went to the office for five minutes but i have a few words to say to beauchamp and am going up at once thank you i cannot come in now i intend to do so on my return papa has gone up to mr beauchamps mr hare has he he and squire pinner continued barbara they have gone to have a smoking bout and if you wait there with papa it will be too late to come in for he is sure not to be home before eleven or twelve mr carlyle bent his head in deliberation then i think it is of little use my going on said he for my business with beauchamp is private i must defer it until tomorrow he took the gate out of her hand closed it and placed the hand within his own arm to walk with her to the house it was done in a matteroffact real sort of way nothing of romance or sentiment hallowed it but barbara hare felt that she was in eden and how have you all been barbara these few days oh very well what made you start off so suddenly you never said you were going or came to wish us goodbye you have just expressed it barbarasuddenly a matter of business suddenly arose and i suddenly went upon it cornelia said you were only gone for a day did she when in london i find so many things to do is mrs hare better just the same i think mammas ailments are fancies half of them if she would rouse herself she would be better what is in that parcel you are not to inquire miss barbara it does not concern you it only concerns mrs hare is it something you have brought for mamma archibald of course a countrymans visit to london entails buying presents for his friends at least it used to be so in the oldfashioned days when people made their wills before starting and were a fortnight doing the journey in a wagon laughed barbara grandpapa used to tell us tales of that when we were children but is it really something for mamma dont i tell you so i have brought something for you oh what is it she uttered her color rising and wondering whether he was in jest or earnest theres an impatient girl what is it wait a moment and you shall see what it is he put the parcel or roll he was carrying upon a garden chair and proceeded to search his pockets every pocket was visited apparently in vain barbara i think it is gone i must have lost it somehow her heart beat as she stood there silently looking up at him in the moonlight was it lost what had it been but upon a second search he came upon something in the pocket of his coattail here it is i believe what brought it there he opened a small box and taking out a long gold chain threw it around her neck a locket was attached to it her cheeks crimson went and came her heart beat more rapidly she could not speak a word of thanks and mr carlyle took up the roll and walked on into the presence of mrs hare barbara followed in a few minutes her mother was standing up watching with pleased expectation the movements of mr carlyle no candles were in the room but it was bright with firelight now dont laugh at me quoth he untying the string of the parcel it is not a roll of velvet for a dress and it is not a roll of parchment conferring twenty thousand pounds a year but it isan air cushion it was what poor mrs hare so worn with sitting and lying had often longed for she had heard such a luxury was to be bought in london but never remembered to have seen one she took it almost with a greedy hand casting a grateful look at mr carlyle how am i to thank you for it she murmured through her tears if you thank me at all i will never bring you anything again cried he gaily i have been telling barbara that a visit to london entails bringing gifts for friends he continued do you see how smart i have made her barbara hastily took off the chain and laid it before her mother what a beautiful chain muttered mrs hare in surprise archibald you are too good too generous this must have cost a great deal this is beyond a trifle nonsense laughed mr carlyle ill tell you both how i happened to buy it i went into a jewellers about my watch which has taken to lose lately in a most unceremonious fashion and there i saw a whole display of chains hanging up some ponderous enough for a sheriff some light and elegant enough for barbara i dislike to see a thick chain on a ladys neck they put me in mind of the chain she lost the day she and cornelia went with me to lynchborough which loss barbara persisted in declaring was my fault for dragging her through the town sightseeing while cornelia did her shoppingfor it was then the chain was lost but i was only joking when i said so was the interruption of barbara of course it would have happened had you not been with me the links were always snapping well these chains in the shop in london put me in mind of barbaras misfortune and i chose one then the shopman brought forth some lockets and enlarged upon their convenience for holding deceased relatives hair not to speak of sweethearts until i told him he might attach one i thought it might hold that piece of hair you prize barbara he concluded dropping his voice what piece asked mrs hare mr carlyle glanced round the room as if fearful the very walls might hear his whisper richards barbara showed it me one day when she was turning out her desk and said it was a curl taken off in that illness mrs hare sank back in her chair and hid her face in her hands shivering visibly the words evidently awoke some poignant source of deep sorrow oh my boy my boy she wailedmy boy my unhappy boy mr hare wonders at my illhealth archibald barbara ridicules it but there lies the source of all my misery mental and bodily oh richard richard there was a distressing pause for the topic admitted of neither hope nor consolation put your chain on again barbara mr carlyle said after a while and i wish you health to wear it out health and reformation young lady barbara smiled and glanced at him with her pretty blue eyes so full of love what have you brought for cornelia she resumed something splendid he answered with a mock serious face only i hope i have not been taken in i bought her a shawl the venders vowed it was true parisian cashmere i gave eighteen guineas for it that is a great deal observed mrs hare it ought to be a very good one i never gave more than six guineas for a shawl in all my life and cornelia i dare say never more than half six laughed mr carlyle well i shall wish you good evening and go to her for if she knows i am back all this while i shall be lectured he shook hands with them both barbara however accompanied him to the front door and stepped outside with him you will catch cold barbara you have left your shawl indoors oh no i shall not how very soon you are leaving you have scarcely stayed ten minutes but you forget i have not been at home you were on your road to beauchamps and would not have been at home for an hour or two in that case spoke barbara in a tone that savored of resentment that was different that was upon business but barbara i think your mother looks unusually ill you know she suffers a little thing to upset her and last night she had what she calls one of her dreams answered barbara she says that it is a warning that something bad is going to happen and she has been in the most unhappy feverish state possible all day papa has been quite angry over her being so weak and nervous declaring that she ought to rouse herself out of her nerves of course we dare not tell him about the dream it related tothe mr carlyle stopped and barbara glanced round with a shudder and drew closer to him as she whispered he had not </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> not given her his arm this time yes to the murder you know mamma has always declared that bethel had something to do with it she says her dreams would have convinced her of it if nothing else did and she dreamt she saw him withwithyou know hallijohn whispered mr carlyle with hallijohn assented barbara with a shiver he was standing over him as he lay on the floor just as he did lay on it and that wretched afy was standing at the end of the kitchen looking on but mrs hare ought not to suffer dreams to disturb her peace by day remonstrated mr carlyle it is not to be surprised at that she dreams of the murder because she is always dwelling upon it but she should strive and throw the feeling from her with the night you know what mamma is of course she ought to do so but she does not papa wonders what makes her get up so ill and trembling of a morning and mamma has to make all sorts of evasive excuses for not a hint as you are aware must be breathed to him about the murder mr carlyle gravely nodded mamma does so harp about bethel and i know that dream arose from nothing in the world but because she saw him pass the gate yesterday not that she thinks that it was he who did it unfortunately there is no room for that but she will persist that he had a hand in it in some way and he haunts her dreams mr carlyle walked on in silence indeed there was no reply that he could make a cloud had fallen upon the house of mr hare and it was an unhappy subject barbara continued but for mamma to have taken it into her head that some evil is going to happen because she had this dream and to make herself miserable over it is so absurd that i have felt quite cross with her all day such nonsense you know archibald to believe that dreams give signs of what is going to happen so far behind these enlightened days your mammas trouble is great barbara and she is not strong i think all our troubles have been great sincesince that dark evening responded barbara have you heard from anne inquired mr carlyle willing to change the subject yes she is very well what do you think they are going to name the baby anne after her mamma so very ugly a name anne i do not think so said mr carlyle it is simple and unpretending i like it much look at the long pretentious names of our familyarchibald cornelia and yours toobarbara what a mouthful they all are barbara contracted her eyebrows it was equivalent to saying that he did not like her name they reached the gate and mr carlyle was about to pass out of it when barbara laid her hand on his arm to detain him and spoke in a timid voice archibald what is it i have not said a word of thanks to you for this she said touching the chain and locket my tongue seemed tied do not deem me ungrateful you foolish girl it is not worth them there now i am paid goodnight barbara he had bent down and kissed her cheek swung through the gate laughing and strode away dont say i never gave you anything he turned his head round to say goodnight all her veins were tingling all her pulses beating her heart was throbbing with its sense of bliss he had never kissed her that she could remember since she was a child and when she returned indoors her spirits were so extravagantly high that mrs hare wondered ring for the lamp barbara and you can get to your work but dont have the shutters closed i like to look out on these light nights barbara however did not get to her work she also perhaps liked looking out on a light night for she sat down at the window she was living the last half hour over again dont say i never gave you anything she murmured did he allude to the chain or to thekiss oh archibald why dont you say that you love me mr carlyle had been all his life upon intimate terms with the hare family his fathers first wifefor the late lawyer carlyle had been twice marriedhad been a cousin of justice hares and this had caused them to be much together archibald the child of the second mrs carlyle had alternately teased and petted anne and barbara hare boy fashion sometimes he quarreled with the pretty little girls sometimes he caressed them as he would have done had they been his sisters and he made no scruple of declaring publicly to the pair that anne was his favorite a gentle yielding girl she was like her mother whereas barbara displayed her own will and it sometimes clashed with young carlyles the clock struck ten mrs hare took her customary sup of brandy and water a small tumbler three parts full without it she believed she could never get to sleep it deadened unhappy thought she said barbara after making it had turned again to the window but she did not resume her seat she stood right in front of it her forehead bent forward against its middle pane the lamp casting a bright light was behind her so that her figure might be distinctly observable from the lawn had any one been there to look upon it she stood there in the midst of dreamland giving way to all its enchanting and most delusive fascinations she saw herself in anticipation the wife of mr carlyle the envied thrice envied of all west lynne for like as he was the dearest on earth to her heart so was he the greatest match in the neighborhood around not a mother but what coveted him for her child and not a daughter but would have said yes and thank you to an offer from the attractive archibald carlyle i never was sure quite sure of it till tonight murmured barbara caressing the locket and holding it to her cheek i always thought he meant something or he might mean nothing but to give me thisto kiss meoh archibald a pause barbaras eyes were fixed upon the moonlight if he would but say he loved me if he would but save the suspense of my aching heart but it must come i know it will and if that cantankerous toad of a corny barbara hare stopped what was that at the far end of the lawn just in advance of the shade of the thick trees their leaves were not causing the movement for it was a still night it had been there some minutes it was evidently a human form what was it surely it was making signs to her or else it looked as though it was that was certainly its arm moving and now it advanced a pace nearer and raised something which it wore on its heada battered hat with a broad brim a wideawake encircled with a wisp of straw barbara hares heart leaped as the saying runs into her mouth and her face became deadly white in the moonlight her first thought was to alarm the servants her second to be still for she remembered the fear and mystery that attached to the house she went into the hall shutting her mamma in the parlor and stood in the shade of the portico gazing still but the figure evidently followed her movement with its sight and the hat was again taken off and waved violently barbara hare turned sick with utter terror she must fathom it she must see who and what it was for the servants she dared not call and those movements were imperative and might not be disregarded but she possessed more innate courage than falls to the lot of some young ladies mamma she said returning to the parlor and catching up her shawl while striving to speak without emotion i shall just walk down the path and see if papa is coming mrs hare did not reply she was musing upon other things in that quiescent happy mood which a small portion of spirits will impart to one weak in body and barbara softly closed the door and stole out again to the portico she stood a moment to rally her courage and again the hat was waved impatiently barbara hare commenced her walk towards it in dread unutterable an undefined sense of evil filling her sinking heart mingling with which came with a rush of terror a fear of that other undefinable evilthe evil mrs hare had declared was foreboded by her dream </chapter>

<chapter>chapter iv the moonlight interview cold and still looked the old house in the moonbeams never was the moon brighter it lighted the farstretching garden it illuminated even the weathercock aloft it shone upon the portico and upon one who appeared in it stealing to the portico from the house had come barbara hare her eyes strained in dread affright on the grove of trees at the foot of the garden what was it that had stepped out of that groove of trees and mysteriously beckoned to her as she stood at the window turning her heart to sickness as she gazed was it a human being one to bring more evil to the house where so much evil had already fallen was it a supernatural visitant or was it but a delusion of her own eyesight not the latter certainly for the figure was now emerging again motioning to her as before and with a white face and shaking limbs barbara clutched her shawl around her and went down that path in the moonlight the beckoning form retreated within the dark recess as she neared it and barbara halted who and what are you she asked under her breath what do you want barbara was the whispered eager answer dont you recognize me too surely she didthe voice at any rateand a cry escaped her telling more of sorrow than of joy though betraying both she penetrated the trees and burst into tears as one in the dress of a farm laborer caught her in his arms in spite of his smockfrock and his strawwisped hat and his false whiskers black as erebus she knew him for her brother oh richard where have you come from what brings you here did you know me barbara was his rejoinder how was it likelyin this disguise a thought crossed my mind that it might be some one from you and even that made me sick with terror how could you run such a risk as to come here she added wringing her hands if you are discovered it is certain death deathuponyou know upon the gibbet returned richard hare i do know it barbara then why risk it should mamma see you it will kill her outright i cant live on as i am living he answered gloomily i have been working in london ever since in london interrupted barbara in london and have never stirred out of it but it is hard work for me and now i have an opportunity of doing better if i can get a little money perhaps my mother can let me have it it is what i have come to ask for how are you working what at in a stableyard a stableyard she uttered in a deeply shocked tone richard did you expect it would be as a merchant or a banker or perhaps as secretary to one of her majestys ministersor that i was a gentleman at large living on my fortune retorted richard hare in a tone of chafed anguish painful to hear i get twelve shillings a week and that has to find me in everything poor richard poor richard she wailed caressing his hand and weeping over it oh what a miserable nights work that was our only comfort is richard that you must have committed the deed in madness i did not commit it at all he replied what she exclaimed barbara i swear that i am innocent i swear i </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> i was not present when the man was murdered i swear that from my own positive knowledge my eyesight i know no more who did it than you the guessing at it is enough for me and my guess is as sure and true a one as that the moon is in the heavens barbara shivered as she drew close to him it was a shivering subject you surely do not mean to throw the guilt on bethel bethel lightly returned richard hare he had nothing to do with it he was after his gins and his snares that night though poacher as he is bethel is no poacher richard is he not rejoined richard hare significantly the truth as to what he is may come out some time not that i wish it to come out the man has done no harm to me and he may go on poaching with impunity till doomsday for all i care he and locksley richard interrupted his sister in a hushed voice mamma entertains one fixed idea which she cannot put from her she is certain that bethel had something to do with the murder then she is wrong why should she think so how the conviction arose at first i cannot tell you i do not think she knows herself but you remember how weak and fanciful she is and since that dreadful night she is always having what she calls dreamsmeaning that she dreams of the murder in all these dreams bethel is prominent and she says she feels an absolute certainty that he was in some way or other mixed up in it barbara he was no more mixed up in it than you andyou say that you were not i was not even at the cottage at the time i swear it to you the man who did the deed was thorn thorn echoed barbara lifting her head who is thorn i dont know who i wish i did i wish i could unearth him he was a friend of afys barbara threw back her neck with a haughty gesture richard what you forget yourself when you mention that name to me well returned richard it was not to discuss these things that i put myself in jeopardy and to assert my innocence can do no good it cannot set aside the coroners verdict of wilful murder against richard hare the younger is my father as bitter against me as ever quite he never mentions your name or suffers it to be mentioned he gave his orders to the servants that it never was to be spoken in the house again eliza could not or would not remember and she persisted in calling your room mr richards i think the woman did it heedlessly not maliciously to provoke papa she was a good servant and had been with us three years you know the first time she transgressed papa warned her the second he thundered at her as i believe nobody else in the world can thunder and the third he turned her from the doors never allowing her to get her bonnet one of the others carrying her bonnet and shawl to the gate and her boxes were sent away the same day papa took an oathdid you hear of it what oath he takes many this was a solemn one richard after the delivery of the verdict he took an oath in the justiceroom in the presence of his brother magistrates that if he could find you he would deliver you up to justice and that he would do it though you might not turn up for ten years to come you know his disposition richard and therefore may be sure he will keep it indeed it is most dangerous for you to be here i know that he never treated me as he ought cried richard bitterly if my health was delicate causing my poor mother to indulge me ought that to have been a reason for his ridiculing me on every possible occasion public and private had my home been made happier i should not have sought the society i did elsewhere barbara i must be allowed an interview with my mother barbara hare reflected before she spoke i do not see how it can be managed why cant she come out to me as you have done is she up or in bed it is impossible to think of it tonight returned barbara in an alarmed tone papa may be in at any moment he is spending the evening at beauchamps it is hard to have been separated from her for eighteen months and to go back without seeing her returned richard and about the money it is a hundred pounds that i want you must be here again tomorrow night richard the money no doubt can be yours but i am not so sure about your seeing mamma i am terrified for your safety but if it is as you say that you are innocent she added after a pause could it not be proved who is to prove it the evidence is strong against me and thorn did i mention him would be as a myth to other people nobody knew anything of him is he a myth said barbara in a low voice are you and i myths retorted richard so even you doubt me richard she suddenly exclaimed why not tell the whole circumstances to archibald carlyle if any one can help you or take measures to establish your innocence he can and you know that he is true as steel theres no other man living should be trusted with the secret that i am here except carlyle where is it they suppose that i am barbara some think that you are dead some that you are in australia the very uncertainty has nearly killed mamma a report arose that you had been seen at liverpool in an australianbound ship but we could not trace it to any foundation it had none i dodged my way to london and there i have been working in a stableyard i could not do better i was not brought up to anything and i did understand horses besides a man that the policerunners were after could be more safe in obscurity considering that he was a gentleman than barbara turned suddenly and placed her hand upon her brothers mouth be silent for your life she whispered heres papa voices were heard approaching the gatethose of justice hare and squire pinner the latter walked on the former came in the brother and sister cowered together scarcely daring to breathe you might have heard barbaras heart beating mr hare closed the gate and walked on up the path i must go richard said barbara hastily i dare not stay another minute be here again tomorrow night and meanwhile i will see what can be done she was speeding away but richard held her back you did not seem to believe my assertion of innocence barbara we are here alone in the still night with god above us as truly as that you and i must sometime meet him face to face i told you the truth it was thorn murdered hallijohn and i had nothing whatever to do with it barbara broke out of the trees and flew along but mr hare was already in locking and barring the door let me in papa she called out the justice opened the door again and thrusting forth his flaxen wig his aquiline nose and his amazed eyes gazed at barbara halloo what brings you out at this time of night young lady i went down to the gate to look for you she panted and hadhadstrolled over to the side path did you not see me barbara was truthful by nature and habit but in such a cause how could she avoid dissimulation thank you papa she said as she went in you ought to have been in bed an hour ago angrily responded mr justice hare </chapter>

<chapter>chapter v mr carlyles office in the centre of west lynne stood two houses adjoining each other one large the other much smaller the large one was the carlyle residence and the small one was devoted to the carlyle offices the name of carlyle bore a lofty standing in the county carlyle and davidson were known as firstclass practitioners no pettifogging lawyers were they it was carlyle davidson in the days gone by now it was archibald carlyle the old firm were brothersinlawthe first mrs carlyle having been mr davidsons sister she had died and left one child the second mrs carlyle died when her son was bornarchibald and his halfsister reared him loved him and ruled him she bore for him all the authority of a mother the boy had known no other and when a little child he had called her mamma corny mamma corny had done her duty by him that was undoubted but mamma corny had never relaxed her rule with an iron hand she liked to rule him now in great things as in small just as she had done in the days of his babyhood and archibald generally submitted for the force of habit is strong she was a woman of strong sense but in some things weak of judgment and the ruling passions of her life were love of archibald and love of saving money mr davidson had died earlier than mr carlyle and his fortunehe had never marriedwas left equally divided between cornelia and archibald archibald was no blood relation to him but he loved the openhearted boy better than his niece cornelia of mr carlyles property a small portion only was bequeathed to his daughter the rest to his son and in this perhaps there was justice since the 20000 pounds brought to mr carlyle by his second wife had been chiefly instrumental in the accumulation of his large fortune miss carlyle or as she was called in town miss corny had never married it was pretty certain she never would people thought that her intense love of her young brother kept her single for it was not likely that the daughter of the rich mr carlyle had wanted for offers other maidens confess to soft and tender impressions not so miss carlyle all who had approached her with the lovelorn tale she sent quickly to the rightabout mr carlyle was seated in his own private room in his office the morning after his return from town his confidential clerk and manager stood near him it was mr dill a little meeklooking man with a bald head he was on the rolls had been admitted years and years ago but he had never set up for himself perhaps he deemed the post of head manager in the office of carlyle davidson with its substantial salary sufficient for his ambition and manager he had been to them when the present mr carlyle was in long petticoats he was a single man and occupied handsome apartments near between the room of mr carlyle and that of the clerks was a small square space or hall having ingress also from the house passage another room opened from it a narrow one which was mr dills own peculiar sanctum here he saw clients when mr carlyle was out or engaged and here he issued private orders a little window not larger than a pane of glass looked out from the clerks office they called it old dills peephole and wished it anywhere else for his spectacles might be discerned at it more frequently than was agreeable the old gentleman had a desk also in their office and there he frequently sat he was sitting there in state this same morning keeping a sharp lookout around him when the door timidly opened and the pretty face of barbara hare appeared at it rosy with blushes can i see mr carlyle mr dill rose from his seat and shook hands with her she drew him into the passage and he closed the door perhaps he felt surprised for it was not the custom for ladies young and single to come there after mr carlyle presently miss barbara he is engaged just now the justices are with him the justices uttered barbara </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> barbara in alarm and papa one whatever shall i do he must not see me i would not have him see me here for the world an ominous sound of talking the justices were evidently coming forth mr dill laid hold of barbara whisked her through the clerks room not daring to take her the other way lest he should encounter them and shut her in his own what the plague brought papa here at this moment thought barbara whose face was crimson a few minutes and mr dill opened the door again they are gone now and the coasts clear miss barbara i dont know what opinion you must form of me mr dill she whispered but i will tell you in confidence that i am here on some private business for mamma who was not well enough to come herself it is a little private matter that she does not wish papa to know of child answered the manager a lawyer receives visits from many people and it is not the place of those about him to think he opened the door as he spoke ushered her into the presence of mr carlyle and left her the latter rose in astonishment you must regard me as a client and pardon my intrusion said barbara with a forced laugh to hide her agitation i am here on the part of mammaand i nearly met papa in your passage which terrified me out of my senses mr dill shut me into his room mr carlyle motioned to barbara to seat herself then resumed his own seat beside his table barbara could not help noticing how different his manners were in his office from his evening manners when he was off duty here he was the staid calm man of business i have a strange thing to tell you she began in a whisper butit is impossible that any one can hear us she broke off with a look of dread it would beit might bedeath it is quite impossible calmly replied mr carlyle the doors are double doors did you notice that they were nevertheless she left her chair and stood close to mr carlyle resting her hand upon the table he rose of course richard is here richard repeated mr carlyle at west lynne he appeared at the house last night in disguise and made signs to me from the grove of trees you may imagine my alarm he has been in london all this while half starving workingi feel ashamed to mention it to youin a stableyard and oh archibald he says he is innocent mr carlyle made no reply to this he probably had no faith in the assertion sit down barbara he said drawing her chair closer barbara sat down again but her manner was hurried and nervous is it quite sure that no stranger will be coming in it would look so peculiar to see me here but mamma was too unwell to come herselfor rather she feared papas questioning if he found out that she came be at ease replied mr carlyle this room is sacred from the intrusion of strangers what of richard he says that he was not in the cottage at the time the murder was committed that the person who really did it was a man of the name of thorn what thorn asked mr carlyle suppressing all signs of incredulity i dont know a friend of afys he said archibald he swore to it in the most solemn manner and i believe as truly as that i am now repeating it to you that he was speaking the truth i want you to see richard if possible he is coming to the same place tonight if he can tell his own tale to you perhaps you may find out a way by which his innocence may be made manifest you are so clever you can do anything mr carlyle smiled not quite anything barbara was this the purport of richards visitto say this oh no he thinks it is of no use to say it for nobody would believe him against the evidence he came to ask for a hundred pounds he says he has an opportunity of doing better if he can have that sum mamma has sent me to you she has not the money by her and she dare not ask papa for it as it is for richard she bade me say that if you will kindly oblige her with the money today she will arrange with you about the repayment do you want it now asked mr carlyle if so i must send to the bank dill never keeps much money in the house when im away not until evening can you manage to see richard it is hazardous mused mr carlyle for him i mean still if he is to be in the grove tonight i may as well be there also what disguise is he in a farm laborers the best he could adopt about here with large black whiskers he is stopping about three miles off he said in some obscure hidingplace and now continued barbara i want you to advise me had i better inform mamma that richard is here or not mr carlyle did not understand and said so i declare i am bewildered she exclaimed i should have premised that i have not yet told mamma it is richard himself who is here but that he has sent a messenger to beg for this money would it be advisable to acquaint her why should you not i think you ought to do so then i will i was fearing the hazard for she is sure to insist upon seeing him richard also wishes for an interview it is only natural mrs hare must be thankful to hear so far that he is safe i never saw anything like it returned barbara the change is akin to magic she says it has put life into her anew and now for the last thing how can we secure papas absence from home tonight it must be accomplished in some way you know his temper were i or mamma to suggest to him to go and see some friend or to go to the club he would immediately stop at home can you devise any plan you see i appeal to you in all my troubles she added like i and anne used to do when we were children it may be questioned if mr carlyle heard the last remark he had dropped his eyelids in thought have you told me all he asked presently lifting them i think so then i will consider it over and i shall not like to come here again interrupted barbara itit might excite suspicions some one might see me too and mention it to papa neither ought you to send to our house wellcontrive to be in the street at four this afternoon stay thats your dinner hour be walking up the street at three three precisely i will meet you he rose shook hands and escorted barbara through the small hall along the passage to the house door a courtesy probably not yet shown to any client by mr carlyle the house door closed upon her and barbara had taken one step from it when something large loomed down upon her like a ship in full sail she must have been the tallest lady in the worldout of a caravan a fine woman in her day but angular and bony now still in spite of the angles and the bones there was majesty in the appearance of miss carlyle whywhat on earth began she have you been with archibald for barbara hare wishing miss carlyle over in asia stammered out the excuse she had given mr dill your mamma sent you on business i never heard of such a thing twice i have been to see archibald and twice did dill answer that he was engaged and must not be interrupted i shall make old dill explain his meaning for observing a mystery over it to me there is no mystery answered barbara feeling quite sick lest miss carlyle should proclaim there was before the clerks or her father mamma wanted mr carlyles opinion upon a little private business and not feeling well enough to come herself she sent me miss carlyle did not believe a word what business asked she unceremoniously it is nothing that could interest you a trifling matter relating to a little money its nothing indeed then if its nothing why were you closeted so long with archibald he was asking the particulars replied barbara recovering her equanimity miss carlyle sniffed as she invariably did when dissenting from a problem she was sure there was some mystery astir she turned and walked down the street with barbara but she was none the more likely to get anything out of her mr carlyle returned to his room deliberated a few moments and then rang his bell a clerk answered it go to the bucks head if mr hare and the other magistrates are there ask them to step over to me the young man did as he was bid and came back with the noted justices at his heels they obeyed the summons with alacrity for they believed they had got themselves into a judicial scrape and that mr carlyle alone could get them out of it i will not request you to sit down began mr carlyle for it is barely a moment i shall detain you the more i think about this mans having been put in prison the less i like it and i have been considering that you had better all five come and smoke your pipes at my house this evening when we shall have time to discuss what must be done come at seven not later and you will find my fathers old jar replenished with the best broadcut and half a dozen churchwarden pipes shall it be so the whole five accepted the invitation eagerly and they were filing out when mr carlyle laid his finger on the arm of justice hare you will be sure to come hare he whispered we could not get on without you all heads with a slight inclination towards those going out are not gifted with the clear good sense of yours sure and certain responded the gratified justice fire and water shouldnt keep me away soon after mr carlyle was left alone another clerk entered miss carlyle is asking to see you sir and colonel bethels come again send in miss carlyle first was the answer what is it cornelia ah you may well ask what saying this morning that you could not dine at six as usual and then marching off and never fixing the hour how can i give my orders i thought business would have called me out but i am not going now we will dine a little earlier though cornelia say a quarter before six i have invited whats up archibald interrupted miss carlyle up nothing that i know of i am very busy cornelia and colonel bethel is waiting i will talk to you at dinnertime i have invited a party for tonight a party echoed miss carlyle four or five of the justices are coming in to smoke their pipes you must put out your fathers leaden tobaccobox and they shant come screamed miss carlyle do you think ill be poisoned with tobacco smoke from a dozen pipes you need not sit in the room nor they either clean curtains are just put up throughout the house and ill have no horrid pipes to blacken them ill buy you some new curtains cornelia if their pipes spoil these he quietly replied and now cornelia i really must beg you to leave me when i have come to the bottom of this affair with barbara hare resolutely returned miss corny dropping the point of the contest as to the pipes you are very clever archie but you cant do me i asked barbara what she came here for business for mamma touching money matters was her reply i ask you to hear your opinion about the scrape the bench have got into is yours now its </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense3> its neither one nor the other and i tell you archibald ill hear what it is i should like to know what you and barbara do with a secret between you mr carlyle knew her and her resolute expression well and he took his course to tell her the truth she was to borrow the words barbara had used to her brother with regard to him true as steel confide to miss carlyle a secret and she was trustworthy and impervious as he could be but let her come to suspect that there was a secret which was being kept from her and she would set to work like a ferret and never stop until it was unearthed mr carlyle bent forward and spoke in a whisper i will tell you if you wish cornelia but it is not a pleasant thing to hear richard hare has returned miss carlyle looked perfectly aghast richard hare is he mad it is not a very sane proceeding he wants money from his mother and mrs hare sent barbara to ask me to manage it for her no wonder poor barbara was flurried and nervous for theres danger on all sides is he at their house how could he be there and his father in it he is in hiding two or three miles off disguised as a laborer and will be at the grove tonight to receive this money i have invited the justices to get mr hare safe away from his own house if he saw richard he would undoubtedly give him up to justice andputting graver considerations asidethat would be pleasant for neither you nor for me to have a connection gibbeted for a willful murder would be an ugly blot on the carlyle escutcheon cornelia miss carlyle sat in silence revolving the news a contraction on her ample brow and now you know all cornelia and i do beg you to leave me for i am overwhelmed with work today </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vi richard hare the younger the bench of justices did not fail to keep their appointment at seven oclock they arrived at miss carlyles one following closely upon the heels of another the reader may dissent from the expression miss carlyles but it is the correct one for the house was hers not her brothers though it remained his home as it had been in his fathers time the house was among the property bequeathed to miss carlyle miss carlyle chose to be present in spite of the pipes and the smoke and she was soon as deep in the discussion as the justices were it was said in the town that she was as good a lawyer as her father had been she undoubtedly possessed sound judgment in legal matters and quick penetration at eight oclock a servant entered the room and addressed his master mr dill is asking to see you sir mr carlyle rose and came back with an open note in his hand i am sorry to find that i must leave you for half an hour some important business has arisen but i will be back as soon as i can who has sent for you immediately demanded miss corny he gave her a quiet look which she interpreted into a warning not to question mr dill is here and will join you to talk the affair over he said to his guests he knows the law better than i do but i will not be long he quitted his house and walked with a rapid step toward the grove the moon was bright as on the previous evening after he had left the town behind him and was passing the scattered villas already mentioned he cast an involuntary glance at the wood which rose behind them on his left hand it was called abbey wood from the circumstance that in old days an abbey had stood in its vicinity all traces of which save tradition had passed away there was one small house or cottage just within the wood and in that cottage had occurred the murder for which richard hares life was in jeopardy it was no longer occupied for nobody would rent it or live in it mr carlyle opened the gate of the grove and glanced at the trees on either side of him but he neither saw nor heard any signs of richards being concealed there barbara was at the window looking out and she came herself and opened the door to mr carlyle mamma is in the most excited state she whispered to him as he entered i knew how it would be has he come yet i have no doubt of it but he has made no signal mrs hare feverish and agitated with a burning spot on her delicate cheeks stood by the chair not occupying it mr carlyle placed a pocketbook in her hands i have brought it chiefly in notes he said they will be easier for him to carry than gold mrs hare answered only by a look of gratitude and clasped mr carlyles hand in both hers archibald i must see my boy how can it be managed must i go into the garden to him or may he come in here i think he might come in you know how bad the night air is for you are the servants astir this evening things seem to have turned out quite kindly spoke up barbara it happens to be annes birthday so mamma sent me just now into the kitchen with a cake and a bottle of wine desiring them to drink her health i shut the door and told them to make themselves comfortable that if we wanted anything we would ring then they are safe observed mr carlyle and richard may come in i will go and ascertain whether he is come said barbara stay where you are barbara i will go myself interposed mr carlyle have the door open when you see us coming up the path barbara gave a faint cry and trembling clutched the arm of mr carlyle there he is see standing out from the trees just opposite this window mr carlyle turned to mrs hare i shall not bring him in immediately for if i am to have an interview with him it must be got over first that i may go back home to the justices and keep mr hare all safe he proceeded on his way gained the trees and plunged into them and leaning against one stood richard hare apart from his disguise and the false and fierce black whiskers he was a blueeyed fair pleasantlooking young man slight and of middle height and quite as yielding and gentle as his mother in her this mild yieldingness of disposition was rather a graceful quality in richard it was regarded as a contemptible misfortune in his boyhood he had been nicknamed leafy dick and when a stranger inquired why the answer was that as a leaf was swayed by the wind so he was swayed by everybody about him never possessing a will of his own in short richard hare though of an amiable and loving nature was not overburdened with what the world calls brains brains he certainly had but they were not sharp ones is my mother coming out to me asked richard after a few interchanged sentences with mr carlyle no you are to go indoors your father is away and the servants are shut up in the kitchen and will not see you though if they did they could never recognize you in that trim a fine pair of whiskers richard let us go in then i am all in a twitter till i get away am i to have the money yes yes but richard your sister says you wish to disclose to me the true history of that lamentable night you had better speak while we are here it was barbara herself wanted you to hear it i think it of little moment if the whole place heard the truth from me it would do no good for i should get no beliefnot even from you try me richard in as few words as possible well there was a row at home about my going so much to hallijohns the governor and my mother thought i went after afy perhaps i did and perhaps i didnt hallijohn had asked me to lend him my gun and that evening when i went to see afwhen i went to see some onenever mind richard interrupted mr carlyle theres an old saying and it is sound advice tell the whole truth to your lawyer and your doctor if i am to judge whether anything can be attempted for you you must tell it to me otherwise i would rather hear nothing it shall be sacred trust then if i must i must returned the yielding richard i did love the girl i would have waited till i was my own master to make her my wife though it had been for years and years i could not do it you know in the face of my fathers opposition your wife rejoined mr carlyle with some emphasis richard looked surprised why you dont suppose i meant anything else i wouldnt have been such a blackguard well go on richard did she return your love i cant be certain sometimes i thought she did sometimes not she used to play and shuffle and she liked too much to be withhim i would think her capricioustelling me i must not come this evening and i must not come the other but i found out they were the evenings when she was expecting him we were never there together you forget that you have not indicted him by any name richard i am at fault richard hare bent forward till his black whiskers brushed mr carlyles shoulder it was that cursed thorn mr carlyle remembered the name barbara had mentioned who was thorn i never heard of him neither had anybody else i expect in west lynne he took precious good care of that he lives some miles away and used to come over in secret courting afy yes he did come courting her returned richard in a savage tone distance was no barrier he would come galloping over at dusk tie his horse to a tree in the wood and pass an hour or two with afy in the house when her father was not at home roaming about the woods with her when he was come to the point richardto the evening hallijohns gun was out of order and he requested the loan of mine i had made an appointment with afy to be at her house that evening and i went down after dinner carrying the gun with me my father called after me to know where i was going i said out with young beauchamp not caring to meet his opposition and the lie told against me at the inquest when i reached hallijohns going the back way along the fields and through the woodpath as i generally did go afy came out all reserve as she could be at times and said she was unable to receive me then that i must go back home we had a few words about it and as we were speaking locksley passed and saw me with the gun in my hand but it ended in my giving way she could do just what she liked with me for i loved the very ground she trod on i gave her the gun telling her it was loaded and she took it indoors shutting me out i did not go away i had a suspicion that she had got thorn there though she denied it to me and i hid myself in some trees near the house again locksley came in view and saw me there and called out to know why i was hiding i shied further off and did not answer himwhat were my private movements to himand that also told against me at the inquest not long afterwardstwenty minutes perhapsi heard a shot which seemed to be in the direction of the cottage somebody having a late pop at the partridges thought i for the sun </lowSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> sun was then setting and at the moment i saw bethel emerge from the trees and run in the direction of the cottage that was the shot that killed hallijohn there was a pause mr carlyle looked keenly at richard there in the moonlight very soon almost in the same moment as it seemed some one came panting and tearing along the path leading from the cottage it was thorn his appearance startled me i had never seen a man show more utter terror his face was livid his eyes seemed starting and his lips were drawn back from his teeth had i been a strong man i should surely have attacked him i was mad with jealousy for i then saw that afy had sent me away that she might entertain him i thought you said this thorn never came but at dusk observed mr carlyle i never knew him to do so until that evening all i can say is he was there then he flew along swiftly and i afterwards heard the sound of his horses hoofs galloping away i wondered what was up that he should look so scared and scutter away as though the deuce was after him i wondered whether he had quarreled with afy i ran to the house leaped up the two steps andcarlylei fell over the prostrate body of hallijohn he was lying just within on the kitchen floor dead blood was round about him and my gun just discharged was thrown near he had been shot in the side richard stopped for breath mr carlyle did not speak i called to afy no one answered no one was in the lower room and it seemed that no one was in the upper a sort of panic came over me a fear you know they always said at home i was a coward i could not have remained another minute with that dead man had it been to save my own life i caught up the gun and was making off when why did you catch up the gun interrupted mr carlyle ideas pass through our minds quicker than we can speak them especially in these sorts of moments was the reply of richard hare some vague notion flashed on my brain that my gun ought not to be found near the murdered body of hallijohn i was flying from the door i say when locksley emerged from the wood full in view and what possessed me i cant tell but i did the worst thing i could doflung the gun indoors again and got away although locksley called after me to stop nothing told against you so much as that observed mr carlyle locksley deposed that he had seen you leave the cottage gun in hand apparently in great commotion that the moment you saw him you hesitated as from fear flung back the gun and escaped richard stamped his foot aye and all owing to my cursed cowardice they had better have made a woman of me and brought me up in petticoats but let me go on i came upon bethel he was standing in that halfcircle where the trees have been cut now i knew that bethel if he had gone straight in the direction of the cottage must have met thorn quitting it did you encounter that hound i asked him what hound returned bethel that fine fellow that thorn who comes after afy i answered for i did not mind mentioning her name in my passion i dont know any thorn returned bethel and i did not know anybody was after afy but yourself did you hear a shot i went on yes i did he replied i suppose it was locksley for hes about this evening and i saw you i continued just at the moment the shot was fired turn round the corner in the direction of hallijohns so i did he said but only to strike into the wood a few paces up whats your drift did you not encounter thorn running from the cottage i persisted i have encountered no one he said and i dont believe anybodys about but ourselves and locksley i quitted him and came off concluded richard hare he evidently had not seen thorn and knew nothing and you decamped the same night richard it was a fatal step yes i was a fool i thought id wait quiet and see how things turned out but you dont know all three or four hours later i went to the cottage again and i managed to get a minutes speech with afy i never shall forget it before i could say one syllable she flew out at me accusing me of being the murderer of her father and she fell into hysterics out there on the grass the noise brought people from the houseplenty were in it thenand i retreated if she can think me guilty the world will think me guilty was my argument and that night i went right off to stop in hiding for a day or two till i saw my way clear it never came clear the coroners inquest sat and the verdict floored me over and afybut i wont curse herfanned the flame against me by denying that any one had been there that night she had been at home she said and had strolled out at the back door to the path that led from west lynne and was lingering there when she heard a shot five minutes afterward she returned to the house and found locksley standing over her dead father mr carlyle remained silent rapidly running over in his mind the chief points of richard hares communication four of you as i understand it were in the vicinity of the cottage that night and from one or the other the shot no doubt proceeded you were at a distance you say richard bethel also could not have been it was not bethel who did it interrupted richard it was an impossibility i saw him as i tell you in the same moment that the gun was fired but now where was locksley it is equally impossible that it could have been locksley he was within my view at the same time at right angles from me deep in the wood away from the paths altogether it was thorn did the deed beyond all doubt and the verdict ought to have been willful murder against him carlyle i see you dont believe my story what you say has startled me and i must take time to consider whether i believe it or not said mr carlyle in his straightforward manner the most singular thing is if you witnessed this thorns running from the cottage in the manner you describe that you did not come forward and denounce him i didnt do it because i was a fool a weak coward as i have been all my life rejoined richard i cant help it it was born with me and will go with me to my grave what would my word have availed that it was thorn when there was nobody to corroborate it and the discharged gun mine was a damnatory proof against me another thing strikes me as curious cried mr carlyle if this man thorn was in the habit of coming to west lynne evening after evening how was it that he never was observed this is the first time i have heard any strangers name mentioned in connection with the affair or with afy thorn chose byroads and he never came save that once but at dusk and dark it was evident to me at the time that he was striving to do it on the secret i told afy so and that it augured no good for her you are not attaching credit to what i say and it is only as i expected nevertheless i swear that i have related the facts as surely as that wei thorn afy and hallijohn must one day meet together before our maker i have told you the truth the words were solemn their tone earnest and mr carlyle remained silent his thoughts full to what end else should i say this went on richard it can do me no service all the assertion i could put forth would not go a jot toward clearing me no it would not assented mr carlyle if ever you are cleared it must be by proofs buti will keep my thought on the matter and should anything arisewhat sort of a man was this thorn in age he might be three or four and twenty tall and slender an outandout aristocrat and his connections where did he live i never knew afy in her boasting way would say he had come from swainson a ten mile ride from swainson quickly interrupted mr carlyle could it be one of the thorns of swainson none of the thorns that i know he was a totally different sort of man with his perfumed hands and his rings and his dainty gloves that he was an aristocrat i believe but of bad taste and style displaying a profusion of jewellery a half smile flitted over carlyles face was it real richard it was he would wear diamond shirtstuds diamond rings diamond pins brilliants all of the first water my impression was that he put them on to dazzle afy she told me once that she could be a grander lady if she chose than i could ever make her a lady on the cross i answered but never on the square thorn was not a man to entertain honest intentions to one in the station of afy hallijohn but girls are simple as geese by your description it could not have been one of the thorns of swainson wealthy tradesmen fathers of young families short stout and heavy as dutchmen staid and most respectable very unlikely men are they to run into an expedition of that sort what expedition questioned richard the murder the riding after afy richard where is afy richard hare lifted his eyes in surprise how should i know i was just going to ask you mr carlyle paused he thought richards answer an evasive one she disappeared immediately after the funeral and it was thoughtin short richard the neighborhood gave her credit for having gone after and joined you no did they what a pack of idiots i have never seen or heard of her carlyle since that unfortunate night if she went after anybody it was after thorn was the man goodlooking i suppose the world would call him so afy thought such an adonis had never been coined out of fable he had shiny black hair and whiskers dark eyes and handsome features but his vain dandyism spoilt him would you believe that his handkerchiefs were soaked in scent they were of the finest cambric silky as a hair as fine as the one barbara bought at lynneborough and gave a guinea for only hers had a wreath of embroidery around it mr carlyle could ascertain no more particulars and it was time richard went indoors they proceeded up the path what a blessing it is the servants windows dont look this way shivered richard treading on mr carlyles heels if they should be looking out upstairs his apprehensions were groundless and he entered unseen mr carlyles part was over he left the poor banned exile to his short interview with his hysterical and tearful mother richard nearly as hysterical as she and made the best of his way home again pondering over what he had heard the magistrates made a good evening of it mr carlyle entertained them to suppermutton chops and bread and cheese they took up their pipes for another whiff when the meal was over but miss carlyle retired to bed the smoke to which she had not been accustomed since her fathers death had made her head ache and her eyes smart about eleven they wished mr carlyle goodnight and departed but mr dill in obedience to a nod from his superior remained sit down a moment dill i want to ask you a question you are intimate with the thorns of swainson do they happen to have any relative a </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> a nephew or cousin perhaps a dandy young fellow i went over last sunday fortnight to spend the day with young jacob was the answer of mr dill one wider from the point than he generally gave mr carlyle smiled young jacob he must be forty i suppose about that but you and i estimate age differently mr archibald they have no nephew the old man never had but those two children jacob and edward neither have they any cousin rich men they are growing now jacob has set up his carriage mr carlyle mused but he expected the answer for neither had he heard of the brothers thorn tanners curriers and leatherdressers possessing a relative of the name dill said he something has arisen which in my mind casts a doubt upon richard hares guilt i question whether he had anything to do with the murder mr dill opened his eyes but his flight mr archibald and his stopping away suspicious circumstances i grant still i have good cause to doubt at the time it happened some dandy fellow used to come courting afy hallijohn in secret a tall slender man as he is described to me bearing the name of thorn and living at swainson could it have been one of the thorn family mr archibald remonstrated the old clerk as if those two respected gentlemen with their wives and babies would come sneaking after that flyaway afy no reflection on them returned mr carlyle this was a young man three or four and twenty a head taller than either i thought it might be a relative i have repeatedly heard them say that they are alone in the world that they are the two last of the name depend upon it it was nobody connected with them and wishing mr carlyle goodnight he departed the servant came in to remove the glasses and the obnoxious pipes mr carlyle sat in a brown study presently he looked round at the man is joyce gone to bed no sir she is just going send her here when you have taken away those things joyce came inthe upper servant at miss carlyles she was of middle height and would never see five and thirty again her forehead was broad her gray eyes were deeply set and her face was pale altogether she was plain but sensiblelooking she was the halfsister of afy hallijohn shut the door joyce joyce did as she was bid came forward and stood by the table have you ever heard from your sister joyce began mr carlyle somewhat abruptly no sir was the reply i think it would be a wonder if i did hear why so if she would go off after richard hare who had sent her father into his grave she would be more likely to hide herself and her doings than to proclaim them to me sir who was that other that fine gentleman who came after her the color mantled in joyces cheeks and she dropped her voice sir did you hear of him not at that time since he came from swainson did he not i believe so sir afy never would say much about him we did not agree upon the point i said a person of his rank would do her no good and afy flew out when i spoke against him mr carlyle caught her up his rank what was his rank afy bragged of his being next door to a lord and he looked like it i only saw him once i had gone home early and there sat him and afy his white hands were all glittering with rings and his shirt was finished off with shining stones where the buttons ought to be have you seen him since never since never but once and i dont think i should know him if i did see him he got up sir as soon as i went into the parlor shook hands with afy and left a fine upright man he was nearly as tall as you sir but very slim those soldiers always carry themselves well how do you know he was a soldier quickly rejoined mr carlyle afy told me so the captain she used to call him but she said he was not a captain yet awhilethe next grade to it aa lieutenant suggested mr carlyle yes sir that was itlieutenant thorn joyce said mr carlyle has it never struck you that afy is more likely to have followed lieutenant thorn than richard hare no sir answered joyce i have felt certain always that she is with richard hare and nothing can turn me from the belief all west lynne is convinced of it mr carlyle did not attempt to turn her from her belief he dismissed her and sat on still revolving the case in all its bearings richard hares short interview with his mother had soon terminated it lasted but a quarter of an hour both dreading interruptions from the servants and with a hundred pounds in his pocket and desolation in his heart the illfated young man once more quitted his childhoods home mrs hare and barbara watched him steal down the path in the telltale moonlight and gain the road both feeling that those farewell kisses they had pressed upon his lips would not be renewed for years and might not be forever </chapter>

<chapter>chapter vii miss carlyle at home the church clocks at west lynne struck eight one lovely morning in july and then the bells chimed out giving token that it was sunday east lynne had changed owners and now it was the property of mr carlyle he had bought it as it stood furniture and all but the transfer had been conducted with secrecy and was suspected by none save those engaged in the negotiations whether lord mount severn thought it might prevent any one getting on the scent or whether he wished to take farewell of a place he had formerly been fond of certain it is that he craved a week or twos visit to it mr carlyle most readily and graciously acquiesced and the earl his daughter and retinue had arrived the previous day west lynne was in ecstacies it called itself an aristocratic place and it indulged hopes that the earl might be intending to confer permanently the light of his presence by taking up his residence again at east lynne the toilettes prepared to meet his admiring eyes were prodigious and pretty barbara hare was not the only young lady who had thereby to encounter the paternal storm miss carlyle was ready for church at the usual time plainly but well dressed as she and archibald were leaving their house they saw something looming up the street flashing and gleaming in the sun a pink parasol came first a pink bonnet and feather came behind it a gray brocaded dress and white gloves the vain little idiot ejaculated miss carlyle but barbara smiled up the street toward them unconscious of the apostrophe well done barbara was the salutation of miss carlyle the justice might well call outyou are finer than a sunbeam not half so fine as many another in the church will be today responded barbara as she lifted her shy blue eyes and blushing face to answer the greetings of mr carlyle west lynne seems bent on outdressing the lady isabel you should have been at the milliners yesterday morning miss carlyle is all the finery coming out today gravely inquired mr carlyle as barbara turned with them toward the church and he walked by her side and his sisters for he had an objection almost invincible as a frenchmans to give his arm to two ladies of course replied barbara first impression is everything you know and the earl and his daughter will be coming to church suppose she should not be in peacocks plumes cried miss carlyle with an imperturbable face oh but she is sure to beif you mean richly dressed cried barbara hastily or suppose they should not come to church laughed mr carlyle what a disappointment to the bonnets and feathers after all barbara what are they to us or we to them resumed miss carlyle we may never meet we insignificant west lynne gentry shall not obtrude ourselves into east lynne it would scarcely be fittingor be deemed so by the earl and lady isabel thats just how papa went on grumbled barbara he caught sight of this bonnet yesterday and when by way of excuse i said i had it to call on them he asked whether i thought the obscure west lynne families would venture to thrust their calls on lord mount severn as though they were of the county aristocracy it was the feather that put him out it is a very long one remarked miss carlyle grimly surveying it barbara was to sit in the carlyle pew that day for she thought the farther she was from the justice the better there was no knowing but he might take a sly revengeful cut at the feather in the middle of service and so dock its beauty scarcely were they seated when some strangers came quietly up the aislea gentleman who limped as he walked with a furrowed brow and gray hair and a young lady barbara looked round with eagerness but looked away again they could not be the expected strangers the young ladys dress was too plaina clearlooking muslin dress for a hot summers day but the old beadle in his manycaped coat was walking before them sideways with his marshalling baton and he marshaled them into the east lynne pew unoccupied for so many years who in the world can they be whispered barbara to miss carlyle that old stupid is always making a mistake and putting people into the wrong places the earl and lady isabel the color flushed into barbaras face and she stared at miss corny why she has no silks and no feathers and no anything cried barbara shes plainer than anybody in the church plainer than any of the fine onesthan you for instance the earl is much altered but i should have known them both anywhere i should have known her from the likeness to her poor motherjust the same eyes and sweet expression aye those brown eyes so full of sweetness and melancholy few who had once seen could mistake or forget them and barbara hare forgetting where she was looked at them much that day she is very lovely thought barbara and her dress is certainly that of a lady i wish i had not had this streaming pink feather what fine jackdaws she must deem us all the earls carriage an open barouche was waiting at the gate at the conclusion of the service he handed his daughter in and was putting his gouty foot upon the step to follow her when he observed mr carlyle the earl turned and held out his hand a man who could purchase east lynne was worthy of being received as an equal though he was but a country lawyer mr carlyle shook hands with the earl approached the carriage and raised his hat to lady isabel she bent forward with her pleasant smile and put her hand into his i have many things to say to you said the earl i wish you would go home with us if you have nothing better to do be east lynnes guest for the remainder of the day he smiled peculiarly as he spoke and mr carlyle echoed it east lynnes guest that is what the earl was at present mr carlyle turned aside to tell his sister cornelia i shall not be home to dinner i am going with lord mount severn goodday barbara mr carlyle stepped into the carriage was followed by the earl and it drove away the sun shone still but the days brightness had gone out for barbara hare how does he know the earl so well how does he know lady isabel she reiterated in her astonishment archibald knows something of most people replied miss corny he saw the earl frequently when he was in town in the spring and lady isabel once or twice what a lovely face hers is barbara made no reply </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> reply she returned home with miss carlyle but her manner was as absent as her heart and that had run away to east lynne </chapter>

<chapter>chapter viii mr kanes concert before lord mount severn had completed the fortnight of his proposed stay the gout came on seriously it was impossible for him to move away from east lynne mr carlyle assured him he was only too pleased that he should remain as long as might be convenient and the earl expressed his acknowledgments he hoped soon to be reestablished on his legs but he was not the gout came and the gout wentnot positively laying him up in bed but rendering him unable to leave his rooms and this continued until october when he grew much better the county families had been neighborly calling on the invalid earl and occasionally carrying off lady isabel but his chief and constant visitor had been mr carlyle the earl had grown to like him in no common degree and was disappointed if mr carlyle spent an evening away from him so that he became as it were quite domesticated with the earl and isabel i am not quite equal to general society he observed to his daughter and it is considerate and kind of carlyle to come here and cheer my loneliness extremely kind said isabel i like him very much papa i dont know anybody that i like half as well was the rejoinder of the earl mr carlyle went up as usual the same evening and in the course of it the earl asked isabel to sing i will if you wish papa was the reply but the piano is so much out of tune that it is not pleasant to sing to it is there any one in west lynne who could come here and tune my piano mr carlyle she added turning to him certainly there is kane would do it shall i send him tomorrow i should be glad if it would not be giving you too much trouble not that tuning will benefit it greatly old thing that it is were we to be much at east lynne i should get papa to exchange it for a good one little thought lady isabel that that very piano was mr carlyles and not hers the earl coughed and exchanged a smile and a glance with his guest mr kane was the organist of st judes church a man of embarrassment and sorrow who had long had a sore fight with the world when he arrived at east lynne the following day dispatched by mr carlyle lady isabel happened to be playing and she stood by and watched him begin his work she was courteous and affableshe was so to every oneand the poor music master took courage to speak of his own affairs and to prefer a humble requestthat she and lord mount severn would patronize and personally attend a concert he was about to give the following week a scarlet blush came into his thin cheeks as he confessed that he was very poor could scarcely live and he was getting up this concert in his desperate need if it succeeded well he could then go on again if not he should be turned out of his home and his furniture sold for the two years rent he owedand he had seven children isabel all her sympathies awakened sought the earl oh papa i have to ask you the greatest favor will you grant it ay child you dont ask them often what is it i want you to take me to a concert at west lynne the earl fell back in surprise and stared at isabel a concert at west lynne he laughed to hear the rustics scraping the fiddle my dear isabel she poured out what she had just heard with her own comments and additions seven children papa and if the concert does not succeed he must give up his home and turn out into the streets with themit is you see almost a matter of life or death with him he is very poor i am poor myself said the earl i was so sorry for him when he was speaking he kept turning red and white and catching up his breath in agitation it was painful to him to tell of his embarrassments i am sure he is a gentleman well you may take a pounds worth of tickets isabel and give them to the upper servants a village concert oh papa it is notcant you see it is not if we you and i will promise to be present all the families round west lynne will attend and he will have the room full they will go because we dohe said so make a sacrifice for once dearest papa and go if it be only for an hour i shall enjoy it if theres nothing but a fiddle and a tambourine you gipsy you are as bad as a professional beggar therego and tell the fellow we will look in for half an hour she flew back to mr kane her eyes dancing she spoke quietly as she always did but her own satisfaction gladdened her voice i am happy to tell you that papa has consented he will take four tickets and we will attend the concert the tears rushed into mr kanes eyes isabel was not sure but they were in her own he was a tall thin delicatelooking man with long white fingers and a long neck he faltered forth his thanks with an inquiry whether he might be allowed to state openly that they would be present tell everybody said she eagerly everybody you come across if as you think it will be the means of inducing people to attend i shall tell all friends who call upon me and ask them to go when mr carlyle came up in the evening the earl was temporarily absent from the room isabel began to speak of the concert it is a hazardous venture for mr kane observed mr carlyle i fear he will only lose money and add to his embarrassments why do you fear that she asked because lady isabel nothing gets patronized at west lynnenothing native and people have heard so long of poor kanes necessities that they think little of them is he so very poor very he is starved half his time starved repeated isabel an expression of perplexity arising to her face as she looked at mr carlyle for she scarcely understood him do you mean that he does not have enough to eat of bread he may but not much better nourishment his salary as organist is thirty pounds and he gets a little stray teaching but he has his wife and children to keep and no doubt serves them before himself i dare say he scarcely knows what it is to taste meat the words brought a bitter pang to lady isabel not enough to eat never to taste meat and she in her carelessness her ignorance her indifferenceshe scarcely knew what term to give ithad not thought to order him a meal in their house of plenty he had walked from west lynne occupied himself an hour with her piano and set off to walk back again battling with his hunger a word from her and a repast had been set before him out of their superfluities such as he never sat down to and that word she had not spoken you are looking grave lady isabel im taking contrition to myself never mind it cannot now be helped but it will always be a dark spot on my memory what is it she lifted her repentant face to his and smiled never mind i say mr carlyle what is past cannot be recalled he looks like a gentleman who kane a gentleman bred his father was a clergyman kanes ruin was his love of musicit prevented his settling to any better paid profession his early marriage also was a drawback and kept him down he is young still mr carlyle i would not be one of your west lynne people for the world here is a young gentleman struggling with adversity and you wont put out your hand to help him he smiled at her warmth some of us will take ticketsi for one but i dont know about attending the concert i fear few would do that because thats just the thing that would serve him if one went another would well i shall try and show west lynne that i dont take a lesson from their book i shall be there before it begins and never come out till the last songs over i am not too grand to go if west lynne is you surely do not think of going i surely do think of it and papa goes with mei persuaded him and i have given mr kane the promise mr carlyle paused i am glad to hear it it will be a perfect boon to kane if it once gets abroad that lord mount severn and lady isabel intend to honor the concert there wont be standing room she danced round with a little gleeful step what high and mighty personages lord mount severn and lady isabel seem to be if you had any goodness of heart mr carlyle you would enlist yourself in the cause also i think i will he smiled papa says you hold sway at west lynne if you proclaim that you mean to go you will induce others i will proclaim that you do he answered that will be all sufficient but lady isabel you must not expect much gratification from the performance a tambourine will be quite enough for me i told papa so i shant think of music i shall think of poor mr kane mr carlyle i know you can be kind if you like i know you would rather be kind than otherwiseit is to be read in your face try and do what you can for him yes i will he warmly answered mr carlyle sold no end of tickets the following day or rather caused them to be sold he praised up the concert far and wide and proclaimed that lord mount severn and his daughter would not think of missing it mr kanes house was besieged for tickets faster than he could write his signature in their corner and when mr carlyle went home to luncheon at midday which he did not often do he laid down two at miss cornys elbow whats this concert tickets archibald you have never gone and bought these what would she have said had she known that the two were not the extent of his investment ten shillings to throw away upon two paltry bits of cardboard chafed miss carlyle you always were a noodle in money matters archibald and always will be i wish i had the keeping of your purse what i have given will not hurt me cornelia and kane is badly off think of his troop of children oh dear said miss corny i imagine he should think of them i suppose it was his own fault they came thats always it poor folks get a heap of children about them and then ask for pity i should say it would be more just if they asked for blame well there the tickets are bought and paid for so they may as well be used you will go with me cornelia and stick ourselves there upon empty benches like two geese and sit staring and counting the candles a pleasant evening you need not fear empty benches the mount severns are going and west lynne is in a fever racing after tickets i suppose you have got aa cap looking at the nondescript article decorating his sisters head that will be suitable to go in cornelia if not you had better order one this suggestion put up miss carlyle hadnt you better have your hair curled and your coat tails lined with white satin and a gold operaglass and a cocked hat retorted she my gracious me a fine new cap to go to their mess of a concert in after paying ten shillings for the tickets the worlds </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> worlds coming to something mr carlyle left her and her grumbling to return to the office lord mount severns carriage was passing at the moment and isabel vane was within it she caused it to stop when she saw mr carlyle and he advanced to her i have been to mr kanes myself for the tickets said she with a beaming look i came into west lynne on purpose i told the coachman to find out where he lived and he did i thought if the people saw me and the carriage there they would guess what i wanted i do hope he will have a full concert i am sure he will replied mr carlyle as he released her hand and lady isabel signed to the carriage to drive on as mr carlyle turned away he met otway bethel a nephew of colonel bethels who was tolerated in the colonels house because he had no other home and appeared incapable to making himself one some persons persisted in calling him a gentlemanas he was by birthothers a mauvais sujet the two are united sometimes he was dressed in a velveteen suit and had a gun in his hand indeed he was rarely seen without a gun being inordinately fond of sport but if all tales whispered were true he supplied himself with game in other ways than by shooting which had the credit of going up to london dealers for the last six months or near upon it he had been away from west lynne why where have you been hiding yourself exclaimed mr carlyle the colonel has been inconsolable come no gammon carlyle i have been on the tramp through france and germany man likes a change sometimes as to the revered colonel he would not be inconsolable if he saw me nailed up in a sixfoot box and carried out feet foremost bethel i have a question to ask you continued mr carlyle dropping his light manner and his voice together take your thoughts back to the night of hallijohns murder i wish you may get it cried mr bethel the reminiscence is not attractive youll do it quietly said mr carlyle it has been told me though it did not appear at the inquest that richard hare held a conversation with you in the wood a few minutes after the deed was done now who told you that interrupted bethel that is not the question my authority is indisputable it is true that he did i said nothing about it for i did not want to make the case worse against dick hare than it already was he certainly did accost me like a man flurried out of his life asking if you had seen a certain lover of afys fly from the cottage one thorn that was the purport thorn thorni think thorn was the name he mentioned my opinion was that dick was either wild or acting a part now bethel i want you to answer me truly the question cannot affect you either way but i must know whether you did see this thorn leave the cottage bethel shook his head i know nothing whatever about any thorn and i saw nobody but dick hare not but what a dozen thorns might have run from the cottage without my seeing them you heard the shot fired yes but i never gave a thought to mischief i knew locksley was in the wood and supposed it came from him i ran across the path bearing toward the cottage and struck into the wood on the other side by and by dick hare pitched upon me like one startled out of his seven senses and asked if i had seen thorn leave the cottage thornthat was the name and you had not i had seen nobody but dick excepting locksley my impression was that nobody else was about i think so still but richard now look you here carlyle i wont do dick hare an injury even by a single word if i can help it and it is of no use setting me on to it i should be the last to set you on to injure any one especially richard hare rejoined mr carlyle and my motive is to do richard hare good not harm i hold a suspicion no matter whence gathered that it was not richard hare who committed the murder but another can you throw any light upon the subject no i cant i have always thought poor wavering dick was nobodys enemy but his own but as to throwing any light on that nights work i cant do it cords should not have dragged me to the inquest to give evidence against dick and for that reason i was glad locksley never let out that i was on the spot how the deuce it got about afterward that i was i cant tell but that was no matter my evidence did not help on the verdict and talking of that carlyle how has it come to your knowledge that richard hare accosted me i have not opened my lips upon it to mortal man it is of no consequence now repeated mr carlyle i do know it and that is sufficient i was in hopes you had really seen this man thorn leave the cottage otway bethel shook his head i should not lay too much stress upon any thorns having been there were i you carlyle dick hare was as one crazy that night and might see shapes and forms where there were none </chapter>

<chapter>chapter ix the song and the dirge the concert was to take place on thursday and on the following saturday lord mount severn intended finally to quit east lynne the necessary preparations for departure were in progress but when thursday morning dawned it appeared a question whether they would not once more be rendered nugatory the house was roused betimes and mr wainwright the surgeon from west lynne summoned to the earls bedside he had experienced another and a violent attack the peer was exceedingly annoyed and vexed and very irritable i may be kept here a weeka montha fortnighta month longer now he uttered fretfully to isabel i am very sorry papa i dare say you do find east lynne dull dull thats not it i have other reasons for wishing east lynne to be quit of us and now you cant go to the concert isabels face flushed not go papa why who is to take you i cant get out of bed oh papa i must be there otherwise it would like almost as thoughas though we had announced what we did not mean to perform you know it was arranged that we should join the ducies the carriage can still take me to the concert room and i can go in with them just as you please i thought you would have jumped at any plea for staying away not at all laughed isabel i should like west lynne to see that i dont despise mr kane and his concert later in the day the earl grew alarmingly worse his paroxysms of pain were awful isabel who was kept from the room knew nothing of the danger and the earls groans did not penetrate to her ears she dressed herself in a gleeful mode full of laughing willfulness marvel her maid superintending in stiff displeasure for the attire chosen did not meet her approbation when ready she went into the earls room shall i do papa lord mount severn raised his swollen eyelids and drew the clothes from his flushed face a shining vision was standing before him a beauteous queen a gleaming fairy he hardly knew what she looked like she had put on a white lace hat and her diamonds the dress was rich and the jewels gleamed from her delicate arms and her cheeks were flushed and her curls were flowing the earl stared at her in amazement how could you dress yourself off like that for a concert you are out of yours senses isabel marvel thinks so too was the gay answer she has had a cross face since i told her what to put on but i did it on purpose papa i thought i would show those west lynne people that i think the poor mans moment worth going to and worth dressing for you will have the whole room gaping at you i dont mind ill bring you word all about it let them gape you vain child you have so dressed yourself to please your vanity but isabel youoooh isabel started as she stood the earls groan of pain was dreadful an awful twinge child there go along talking makes me worse papa shall i stay at home with you she gravely asked every consideration should give way to illness if you would like me to remain or if i can do any good pray let me quite the contrary i had rather you were away you can do no earthly good for i could not have you in the room goodbye darling if you see carlyle tell him i shall hope to see him tomorrow the room was partly full when mrs ducie her two daughters and lady isabel entered and were conducted to seats by mr kaneseats he had reserved for them at the upper end near the orchestra the same dazzling vision which had burst on the sight of lord mount severn fell on that of the audience in isabel with her rich white dress her glittering diamonds her flowing curls and her wondrous beauty the misses ducie plain girls in brown silks turned up their noses worse than nature had done it for them and mrs ducie heaved an audible sigh the poor motherless girl is to be pitied my dears she whispered she has nobody to point out to her suitable attire this ridiculous decking out must have been marvels doings but she looked like a lily among poppies and sunflowers whether the decking out was ridiculous or not was lord mount severn right when he accused her of dressing so in selfgratification very likely for has not the great preacher said that childhood and youth are vanity miss carlyle the justice and barbara also had seats near the orchestra for miss carlyle in west lynne was a person to be considered and not hidden behind others mr carlyle however preferred to join the gentlemen who congregated and stood round about the door inside and out there was scarcely standing room in the place mr kane had as was anticipated got a bumper and the poor man could have worshipped lady isabel for he knew he owed it to her it was very longcountry concerts generally areand was about three parts over when a powdered head larger than any cauliflower ever grown was discerned ascending the stairs behind the group of gentlemen which head when it brought its body in full view was discovered to belong to one of the footmen of lord mount severn the calves alone cased in their silk stockings were a sight to be seen and these calves betook themselves inside the concert room with a deprecatory bow for permission to the gentlemen they had to steer throughand there they came to a standstill the cauliflower extending forward and turning itself about from right to left well ill be jiffled cried an astonished old foxhunter who had been elbowed by the footman the cheek these fellows have the fellow in question did not appear however to be enjoying any great amount of cheek just at that moment for he looked perplexed humble and uneasy suddenly his eye fell upon mr carlyle and it lighted up beg pardon sir could you happen to inform me whereabouts my young lady is sitting at the other end of the room near the orchestra im sure i dont know however i am to get to her then returned the man more in selfsoliloquy than to mr carlyle the room is choke full and i dont like crushing by my lord is taken alarmingly worse sir he explained in an awestricken tone it is feared he is dying mr carlyle was painfully startled his screams of pain were awful sir mr wainwright and </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> and another doctor from west lynne are with him and an express has gone to lynneboro for physicians mrs mason said we were to fetch my young lady right home and not lose a moment and we brought the carriage sir wells galloping his horses all the way i will bring lady isabel said mr carlyle i am sure sir i should be under everlasting obligations if you would returned the man he worked his way through the concert roomhe was tall and slendermany looking daggers at him for a pathetic song was just then being given by a london lady he disregarded all and stood before isabel i thought you were not coming to speak to me tonight is it not a famous room i am so pleased more than famous lady isabel choosing his words that they might not alarm her lord mount severn does not find himself so well and he has sent the carriage for you papa not so well she quickly exclaimed not quite at any rate he wishes you to go home will you allow me to pilot you through the room oh my dear considerate papa she laughed he fears i shall be weary and would emancipate me before the time thank you mr carlyle but i will wait till the conclusion no no lady isabel it is not that lord mount severn is indeed worse her countenance changed to seriousness but she was not alarmed very well when the song is overnot to disturb the room i think you had better lose no time he urged never mind the song and the room she rose instantly and put her arm within mr carlyles a hasty word of explanation to mrs ducie and he led her away the room in its surprise making for them what space it might many an eye followed them but none more curiously and eagerly than barbara hares where is he going to take her to involuntarily uttered barbara how should i know returned miss corny barbara you have done nothing but fidget all the night whats the matter with you folks come to a concert to listen not to talk and fidget isabels mantle was procured from the anteroom where it had been left and she descended the stairs with mr carlyle the carriage was drawn up close to the entrance and the coachman had his reins gathered ready to start the footmannot the one who had gone upstairsthrew open the carriage door as he saw her he was new in the service a simple country native just engaged she withdrew her arm from mr carlyles and stood a moment before stepping in looking at the man is papa much worse oh yes my lady he was screaming shocking but they think hell live till morning with a sharp cry she seized the arm of mr carlyleseized it for support in her shock of agony mr carlyle rudely thrust the man away he would willingly have flung him at full length on the pavement oh mr carlyle why did you not tell me she shivered my dear lady isabel i am grieved that you are told now but take comfort you know how ill he frequently is and this may be but an ordinary attack step in i trust we shall find it nothing more are you going home with me certainly i shall not leave you to go alone she moved to the other side of the chariot making room for him thank you i will sit outside but the night is cold oh no he closed the door and took his seat by the coachman the footman got up behind and the carriage sped away isabel gathered herself into her corner and moaned aloud in her suspense and helplessness the coachman drove rapidly and soon whipped his horses through the lodgegates the housekeeper mrs mason waited at the halldoor to receive lady isabel mr carlyle helped her out of the carriage and gave her his arm up the steps she scarcely dared to inquire is he better may i go to his room she panted yes the earl was betterbetter in so far as that he was quiet and senseless she moved hastily toward his chamber mr carlyle drew the housekeeper aside is there any hope not the slightest sir he is dying the earl knew no one pain was gone for the present and he lay on his bed calm but his face which had death in it all too plainly startled isabel she did not scream or cry she was perfectly quiet save that she had a fit of shivering will he soon be better she whispered to mr wainwright who stood there the surgeon coughed well hehewe must hope it my lady but why does his face look like that it is palegray i never saw anybody else look so he has been in great pain my lady and pain leaves its traces on the countenance mr carlyle who had come and was standing by the surgeon touched his arm to draw him from the room he noticed the look on the earls face and did not like it he wished to question the surgeon lady isabel saw that mr carlyle was about to quit the room and beckoned to him do not leave the house mr carlyle when he wakes up it may cheer him to see you here he liked you very much i will not leave it lady isabel i did not think of doing so in timeit seemed an agethe medical men arrived from lynneboroughthree of themthe groom had thought he could not summon too many it was a strange scene they entered upon the ghastly peer growing restless again now battling with his departing spirit and the gala robes the sparkling gems adorning the young girl watching at his side they comprehended the case without difficulty that she had been suddenly called from some scene of gayety they stooped to look at the earl and felt his pulse and touched his heart and exchanged a few murmured words with mr wainwright isabel had stood back to give them place but her anxious eyes followed their every movement they did not seem to notice her and she stepped forward can you do anything for him will he recover they all turned at the address and looked at her one spoke it was an evasive answer tell me the truth she implored with feverish impatience you must not trifle with me do you not know me i am his only child and i am here alone the first thing was to get her away from the room for the great change was approaching and the parting struggle between the body and the spirit might be one of warfareno sight for her but in answer to their suggestion that she should go she only leaned her head upon the pillow by her father and moaned in despair she must be got out of the room cried one of the physicians almost angrily maam turning suddenly upon mrs mason are there no reserves in the houseno one who can exert influence over the young lady she has scarcely any relatives in the world replied the housekeeper no near ones and we happen to be just now quite alone but mr carlyle seeing the urgency of the case for the earl with every minute grew more excited approached and whispered her you are as anxious as we can be for your fathers recovery as anxious she uttered reproachfully you know what i would imply of course our anxiety can be as nothing to yours as nothingas nothing i think my heart will break thenforgive meyou should not oppose the wishes of his medical attendants they wish to be alone with him and time is being lost she rose up she placed her hands on her brow as if to collect the sense of the words and then she addressed the doctors is it really necessary that i should leave the roomnecessary for him it is necessary my ladyabsolutely essential she broke into a passion of tears and sobs as mr carlyle lead her to another apartment he is my dear father i have but him in the wide world she exclaimed i knowi know i feel for you all that you are feeling twenty times this night i have wishedforgive me the thoughtthat you were my sister so that i might express my sympathy more freely and comfort you tell me the truth then why i am kept away if you can show me sufficient cause i will be reasonable and obey but do not say again i should be disturbing him for it is not true he is too ill for you to see himhis symptoms are too painful in fact it would not be proper and were you to go in in defiance of advice you would regret it all your after life is he dying mr carlyle hesitated ought he to dissemble with her as the doctors had done a strong feeling was upon him that he ought not i trust to you not to deceive me she simply said i fear he isi believe he is she rose upshe grasped his arm in the sudden fear that flashed over her you are deceiving me and he is dead i am not deceiving you lady isabel he is not dead butit may be very near she laid her face down upon the soft pillow going forever from megoing forever oh mr carlyle let me see him for a minutejust one farewell will you not try for me he knew how hopeless it was but he turned to leave the room i will go and see but you will remain here quietlyyou will not come she bowed her head in acquiescence and he closed the door had she indeed been his sister he would probably have turned the key upon her he entered the earls chamber but not many seconds did he remain in it it is over he whispered to mrs mason whom he met in the corridor and mr wainwright is asking for you you are soon back cried isabel lifting her head may i go he sat down and took her hand shrinking from his task i wish i could comfort you he exclaimed in a tone of deep emotion her face turned of a ghastly whitenessas white as anothers not far away tell me the worst she breathed i have nothing to tell you but the worst may god support you dear lady isabel she turned to hide her face and its misery away from him and a low wail of anguish broke from her telling its own tale of despair the gray dawn of morning was breaking over the world advent of another bustling day in lifes history but the spirit of william vane earl of mount severn had soared away from it forever </chapter>

<chapter>chapter x the keepers of the dead events between the death of lord mount severn and his interment occurred quickly and to one of them the reader may feel inclined to demur as believing that it could have no foundation in fact in the actions of real life but must be a wild creation of the authors brain he would be wrong the author is no more fond of wild creations than the reader the circumstance did take place the earl died on friday morning at daylight the news spread rapidly it generally does on the death of a peer if he has been of note whether good or bad in the world and was known in london before the day was overthe consequence of which was that by saturday morning early a shoal of what the late peer would have called harpies had arrived to surround east lynne there were creditors of all sorts for small sums and for great for five or ten pounds up to five or ten thousand some were civil some impatient some loud and rough and angry some came to put in executions on the effects and someto arrest the body this last act was accomplished cleverly two men each with a remarkably hooked nose stole away from the hubbub of the clamorous and peering cunningly about made their way to </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> to the side or tradesmans entrance a kitchenmaid answered their gentle appeal at the bell is the coffin come yet said they coffinno was the girls reply the shell aint here yet mr jones didnt promise that till nine oclock and it havent gone eight it wont be long quoth they its on its road well go up to his lordships room please and be getting ready for it the girl called the butler two men from jones the undertakers sir announced she the shells coming on and they want to go up and make ready for it the butler marshaled them upstairs himself and introduced them to the room that will do said they as he was about to enter with them we wont trouble you to wait and closing the door upon the unsuspicious butler they took up their station on either side of the dead like a couple of illomened mutes they had placed an arrest upon the corpse it was theirs until their claim was satisfied and they sat down to thus watch and secure it pleasant occupation it may have been an hour later that lady isabel leaving her own chamber opened noiselessly that of the dead she had been in it several times during the previous day at first with the housekeeper afterward when the nameless dread was somewhat effaced alone but she felt nervous again this morning and had gained the bed before she ventured to lift her eyes from the carpet and encounter the sight then she started for there sat two strangelooking menand not attractive men either it darted through her mind that they must be people from the neighborhood come to gratify an idle and unpardonable curiosity her first impulse was to summon the butler her second to speak to them herself do you want anything here she quietly said much obleeged for the inquiry miss we are all right the words and tone struck her as being singular in the extreme and they kept their seats too as though they had a right to be there why are you here she repeated what are you doing well miss i dont mind telling you for i suppose you are his daughterpointing his left thumb over his shoulder at the late peerand we hear he have got no other relative anigh him we have been obleeged miss to perform an unpleasant dooty and secure him the words were like greek to her and the men saw that they were he unfortunately owed a slight amount of money missas you perhaps be aware on and our employers is in deep so as soon as they heard what had happened they sent us down to arrest the dead corpse and we have done it amazement horror fear struggled together in the shocked mind of lady isabel arrest the dead she had never heard of a like calamity nor could she have believed in such arrest it for what purpose what to do to disfigure itto sell it with a panting heart and ashy lips she turned from the room mrs mason happened to be passing near the stairs and isabel flew to her laying hold of her with both hands in her terror as she burst into a fit of nervous tears those menin there she gasped what men my lady returned mrs mason surprised i dont know i dont know i think they are going to stop there they say they have taken papa after a pause of bewildered astonishment the housekeeper left her standing where she was and went to the earls chamber to see if she could fathom the mystery of the words isabel leaned against the balustrades partly for support partly that she seemed afraid to stir from them and the ominous disturbances downstairs reached her ears strangers interlopers appeared to be in the hall talking vehemently and complaining in bitter tones more and more terrified she held her breath to listen wheres the good of your seeing the young lady cried the butler in a tone of remonstrance she knows nothing about the earls affairs she is in grief enough just now without any other worry i will see her returned a dogged voice if shes too startup and mighty to come down and answer a question or two why ill find my way on to her here we are a shameful crowd of us swindled out of our own told theres nobody we can speak to nobody here but the young lady and she must not be troubled she didnt find it trouble to help to spend our money she has got no honor and feelings of a lady if she dont come and speak to us there repressing her rebellious emotions lady isabel glided partly down the staircase and softy called to the butler what is all this she asked i must know oh my lady dont go amongst those rough men you cant do any good pray go back before they see you i have sent for mr carlyle and expect him here momentarily did papa owe them all money she said shivering im afraid he did my lady she went swiftly on and passing through the few stragglers in the hall entered the diningroom where the chief mass had congregated and the hubbub was loudest all anger at least external anger was hushed at her sight she looked so young so innocent so childlike in her pretty morning dress of peachcolored muslin her fair face shaded by its falling curls so little fit to combat with or understand their business that instead of pouring forth complaints they hushed them into silence i heard some one calling out that i ought to see you she began her agitation causing the words to come forth in a jerking manner what did you want with me then they poured forth their complaints but not angrily and she listened till she grew sick there were many and formidable claims promissory notes and i o us overdue bills and underdue bills heavy outstanding debts of all sorts and trifles comparatively speaking for housekeeping servants liveries outdoor servants wages bread and meat what was isabel vane to answer what excuse to offer what hope or promise to give she stood in bewilderment unable to speak turning from one to the other her sweet eyes full of pity and contrition the fact is young lady spoke up one who bore the exterior of a gentleman we should not have come down troubling youat least i can answer for myselfbut his lordships men of business warburton ware to whom many of us hastened last evening told us there would not be a shilling for anybody unless it could be got from furniture when it comes to that it is first come first served and i got down by morning light and levied an execution which was levied before you came put in a man who might be brother to the two upstairs to judge by his nose but whats such furniture as this to our claimsif you come to combine em no more than a bucket of water is to the thames what can i do shivered lady isabel what is it you wish me to do i have no money to give you i no miss broke in a quiet pale man if report tells me you are worse wronged than we are for you wont have a roof to put your head under or a guinea to call your own he has been a scoundrel to everybody interrupted an intemperate voice he has ruined thousands the speech was hissed down even they were not men gratuitously to insult a delicate young lady perhaps youll just answer us a question miss persisted the voice in spite of the hisses is there any ready money that can but another person had entered the roommr carlyle he caught sight of the white face and trembling hands of isabel and interrupted the last speaker with scant ceremony what is the meaning of this he demanded in a tone of authority what do you want if you are a friend of the late peers you ought to know what we want was the response we want our debts paid but this is not the place to come to returned mr carlyle your coming here flocking in this extraordinary manner will do no good you must go to warburton ware we have been to them and received their answera cool assurance that therell be nothing for anybody at any rate youll get nothing here observed mr carlyle to the assembly collectively allow me to request that you leave the house at once it was little likely that they would for him and they said it then i warn you of the consequences of a refusal quietly said mr carlyle you are trespassing upon a strangers property this house is not lord mount severns he sold it some time back they knew better some laughed and said these tricks were stale listen gentlemen rejoined mr carlyle in the plain straightforward manner that carried its own truth to make an assertion that could be disproved when the earls affairs come to be investigated would be simply foolish i give you my word of honor as a gentlemannay as a fellowmanthat this estate with the house and all it contains passed months ago from the hands of lord mount severn and during his recent sojourn here he was a visitor in it go and ask his men of business who purchased it was the inquiry mr carlyle of west lynne some of you may possibly know him by reputation some of them did a cute young lawyer observed a voice as his father was before him i am he proceeded mr carlyle and being a cute lawyer as you do me the honor to decide you cannot suppose i should risk my money upon any sale not perfectly safe and legal i was not an agent in the affair i employed agents for it was my own money that i invested and east lynne is mine is the purchase money paid over inquired more than one it was paid over at the timelast june what did lord mount severn do with the money i do not know replied mr carlyle i am not cognizant of lord mount severns private affairs significant murmurs arose strange that the earl should stop two or three months at a place that wasnt his it may appear so to you but allow me to explain returned mr carlyle the earl expressed a wish to pay east lynne a few days visit by way of farewell and i acceded before the few days were over he was taken ill and remained from that time too ill to quit it this very daythis day gentlemen as we stand here was at length fixed for his departure and you tell us you bought the furniture everything as it stands you need not doubt my word for the proofs will be forthcoming east lynne was in the market for sale i heard of it and became the purchaserjust as i might have bought an estate from any of you and now as this is my house and you have no claim upon me i shall be obliged to you to withdraw perhaps youll claim the horses and carriages next sir cried the man with the hooked nose mr carlyle raised his head haughtily what is mine is mine legally purchased and paid fora fair just price the carriages and horses i have nothing to do with lord mount severn brought them down with him and i have got a safe watcher over them in the out premises to see as they dont run away nodded the man complacently and if i dont mistake theres a safe watcher over something else upstairs what a cursed scoundrel mount severn was whatever he may have been it does not give you the right to outrage the feelings of his daughter warmly interrupted mr carlyle and i should have thought that men calling themselves englishmen would have disdained the shame allow me lady isabel he added imperatively taking her hand to lead her from the room i will remain and deal with this business but she hesitated and </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense3> and stopped the injury her father had done these men was telling painfully on her sense of right and she essayed to speak a word of apology of sorrow she thought she ought to do so she did not like them to deem her quite heartless but it was a painful task and the color went and came in her pale face and her breath was labored with the excess of her tribulation i am very sorry she stammered and with the effort of speaking emotion quite got the better of her and she burst into tears i did not know anything of all this my fathers affairs were not spoken of before me i believe i have not anything if i had i would divide it amongst you as equally as i could but should the means ever be in my powershould money ever be mine i will thankfully pay all your claims all your claims lady isabel little thought what that all would comprise however such promises made at such a moment fell heedlessly upon the ear scarcely one present but felt sympathy and sorrow for her and mr carlyle drew her from the room he closed the door upon the noisy crew and then sobs came forth hysterically i am so grieved lady isabel had i foreseen this annoyance you should have been spared it can you go upstairs alone or shall i call mrs mason oh yes i can go alone i am not ill only frightened and sick this is not the worst she shivered there are two men upupwith papa up with papa mr carlyle was puzzled he saw that she was shaking from head to foot as she stood before him i cannot understand it and it terrifies me she continued attempting an explanation they are sitting in the room close to him they have taken him they say a blank thunderstruck pause mr carlyle looked at herhe did not speak and then he turned and looked at the butler who was standing near but the man only responded by giving his head a half shake and mr carlyle saw that it was an ominous one i will clear the house of these he said to lady isabel pointing back to the diningroom and then join you upstairs two ruffians sir and they have got possession of the body whispered the butler in mr carlyles ear as lady isabel departed they obtained entrance to the chamber by a sly deceitful trick saying they were the undertakers men and that he cant be buried unless their claims are paid if its for a month to come it has upset all our stomachs sir mrs mason while telling mefor she was the first one to know itwas as sick as she could be at present mr carlyle returned to the diningroom and bore the brunt of the anger of those savages and it may be said illused men not that it was vented upon himquite the contrarybut on the memory of the unhappy peer who lay overhead a few had taken the precaution to insure the earls life and they were the best off they left the house after a short space of time for mr carlyles statement was indisputable and they knew the law better than to remain trespassers on his property but the custodians of the dead could not be got rid of mr carlyle proceeded to the deathchamber and examined their authority a similar case had never occurred under his own observation though it had under his fathers and mr carlyle remembered hearing of it the body of a church dignitary who had died deeply in debt was arrested as it was being carried through the cloisters to its grave in the cathedral these men sitting over lord mount severn enforced heavy claims and there they must sit until the arrival of mr vane from castle marlingnow the earl of mount severn on the following morning sunday mr carlyle proceeded again to east lynne and found to his surprise that there was no arrival isabel sat in the breakfastroom alone the meal on the table untouched and she shiveringas it seemedon a low ottoman before the fire she looked so ill that mr carlyle could not forbear remarking upon it i have not slept and i am very cold she answered i did not close my eyes all night i was so terrified terrified at what he asked at those men she whispered it is strange that mr vane has not come is the post in i dont know she apathetically replied i have received nothing she had scarcely spoke when the butler entered with his salver full of letters most of them bearing condolence with lady isabel she singled out one and hastened to open it for it bore the castle marling postmark it is mrs vanes handwriting she remarked to mr carlyle castle marling saturday my dear isabeli am dreadfully grieved and shocked at the news conveyed in mr carlyles letter to my husband for he has gone cruising in his yacht and i opened it goodness knows where he may be round the coast somewhere but he said he should be home for sunday and as he is pretty punctual in keeping his word i expect him be assured he will not lose a moment in hastening to east lynne i cannot express what i feel for you and am too bouleversee to write more try and keep up your spirits and believe me dear isabel with sincere sympathy and regret faithfully yours emma mount severn the color came into isabels pale cheek when she read the signature she thought had she been the writer she should in that first early letter have still signed herself emma vane isabel handed the note to mr carlyle it is very unfortunate she sighed mr carlyle glanced over it as quickly as mrs vanes illegible writing allowed him and drew in his lips in a peculiar manner when he came to the signature perhaps at the same thought which had struck isabel had mrs vane been worth a rush she would have come herself knowing your lonely situation he uttered impulsively isabel leaned her head upon her hand all the difficulties and embarrassments of her position came crowding on her mind no orders had been given in preparation for the funeral and she felt that she had no right to give any the earls of mount severn were buried at mount severn but to take her father thither would involve great expense would the present earl sanction that since the previous morning she seemed to have grown old in the worlds experience her ideas were changed the bent of her thoughts had been violently turned from its course instead of being a young lady of high position of wealth and rank she appeared to herself more in the light of an unfortunate pauper and interloper in the house she was inhabiting it has been the custom in romance to present young ladies especially if they be handsome and interesting as being entirely oblivious of matteroffact cares and necessities supremely indifferent to future prospects of povertypoverty that brings hunger and thirst and cold and nakedness but be assured this apathy never existed in real life isabel vanes grief for her fatherwhom whatever may have been the aspect he wore for others she had deeply loved and reverencedwas sharply poignant but in the midst of that grief and of the singular troubles his death had brought forth she could not shut her eyes to her own future its blank uncertainty its shadowedforth embarrassments did obtrude themselves and the words of that plainspeaking creditor kept ringing in her ears you wont have a roof to put your head under or a guinea to call your own where was she to go with whom to live she was in mr carlyles house now and how was she to pay the servants money was owing to them all mr carlyle how long has this house been yours she asked breaking the silence it was in june that the purchase was completed did lord mount severn never tell you he had sold it to me no never all these things are yours glancing round the room the furniture was sold with the house not these sort of things he added his eye falling on the silver on the breakfast table not the plate and linen not the plate and linen then those poor men who were here yesterday have a right to them she quickly cried i scarcely know i believe the plate goes with the entailand the jewels go also the linen cannot be of consequence either way are my clothes my own he smiled as he looked at her smiled at her simplicity and assured her that they were nobodys else i did not know she sighed i did not understand so many strange things have happened in the last day or two that i seem to understand nothing indeed she could not understand she had no definite ideas on the subject of this transfer of east lynne to mr carlyle plenty of indefinite ones and they were haunting her fears of debt to him and of the house and its contents being handed over to him in liquidation perhaps only partial were working in her brain does my father owe you any money she breathed in a timid tone not any he replied lord mount severn was never indebted to me in his life yet you purchased east lynne as any one else might have done he answered discerning the drift of her thoughts i was in search of an eligible estate to invest money in and east lynne suited me i feel my position mr carlyle she resumed the rebellious fears forcing themselves to her eyes thus to be intruding upon you for a shelter and i cannot help myself you can help grieving me he gently answered which you do much when you talk of obligation the obligation is on my side lady isabel and when i express a hope that you will continue at east lynne while it can be of service however prolonged that period may be i assure you i say it in all sincerity you are very kind she faltered and for a few days until i can think untiloh mr carlyle are papas affairs really so bad as they said yesterday she broke off her perplexities recurring to her with vehement force is there nothing left now mr carlyle might have given the evasive assurance that there would be plenty left just to tranquilize her but to have used deceit with her would have pricked against every feeling of his nature and he saw how implicitly she relied upon his truth i fear things are not very bright he answered that is so far as we can see at present but there may have been some settlement effected for you that you do not know of warburton ware no she interrupted i never heard of a settlement and i am sure there is none i see the worst plainly i have no home no home and no money this house is yours the town house and mount severn go to mr vane and i have nothing but surely mr vane will be delighted to welcome you to your old home the houses pass to himit almost seems as though you had the greater right in them than he or mrs vane my home with them she retorted as if the words had stung her what are you saying mr carlyle i beg your pardon lady isabel i should not have presumed to touch upon these points myself but nay i think i ought to beg yours she interrupted more calmly i am only grateful for the interest you take in themthe kindness you have shown but i could not make my home with mrs vane mr carlyle rose he could do no good by remaining and did not think it well to intrude longer he suggested that it might be more pleasant if isabel had a friend with her mrs ducie would no doubt be willing to come and she was a kind motherly woman isabel shook her head with a passing shudder have </lowSuspense3> <highSuspense1> have strangers here withallthatin papas chamber she uttered mrs ducie drove over yesterday perhaps to remaini dont know but i was afraid of questions and would not see her when i think ofthati feel thankful that i am alone the housekeeper stopped mr carlyle as he was going out sir what is the news from castle marling pound said there was a letter is mr vane coming he was out yachting mrs vane expected him home yesterday so it is to be hoped he will be here today whatever will be done if he does not come she breathed the leaden coffin ought to be soldered down for you know air the state he was in when he died it can be soldered down without mr vane of coursewithout mr vane its not that sir will those men allow it to be done the undertakers were here this morning at daybreak and those men intimated that they were not going to lose sight of the dead the words sounded significant to us but we asked them no questions have they a right to prevent it sir upon my word i cannot tell replied mr carlyle the proceeding is so rare a one that i know little what right of law they have or have not do not mention this to lady isabel and when mr vawhen lord mount severn arrives send down to apprise me of it </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xi the new peerthe banknote a postchaise was discerned thundering up the avenue that sunday afternoon it contained the new peer lord mount severn the more direct line of rail from castle marling brought him only to within five miles of west lynne and thence he had travelled in a hired chaise mr carlyle soon joined him and almost at the same time mr warburton arrived from london absence from town at the period of the earls death had prevented mr warburtons earlier attendance business was entered upon immediately the present earl knew that his predecessor had been an embarrassed man but he had no conception of the extent of the evil they had not been intimate and rarely came in contact as the various items of news were now detailed to himthe wasteful expenditure the disastrous ruin the total absence of provision for isabelhe stood petrified and aghast he was a tall stout man of threeandforty years his nature honorable his manner cold and his countenance severe it is the most iniquitous piece of business i ever heard of he exclaimed to the two lawyers of all the reckless fools mount severn must have been the worst unpardonably improvident as regards his daughter was the assenting remark improvident it must have been rank madness retorted the earl no man in his senses could leave a child to the mercy of the world as he has left her she has not a shillingliterally not a shilling in her possession i put the question to her what money there was in the house when the earl died twenty or twentyfive pounds she answered which she had given to mason who required it for housekeeping purposes if the girl wants a yard of ribbon for herself she has not the pence to pay for it can you realize such a case to the mind continued the excited peer i will stake my veracity that such a one never occurred yet no money for her own personal wants exclaimed mr carlyle not a halfpenny in the world and there are no funds and will be none that i can see for her to draw upon quite correct my lord nodded mr warburton the entailed estates go to you and what trifling matter of personal property may be left the creditors will take care of i understand east lynne is yours cried the earl turning sharply upon mr carlyle isabel has just said so it is was the reply it became mine last june i believe his lordship kept the fact a close secret he was obliged to keep it a secret interposed mr warburton addressing lord mount severn for not a stiver of the purchase money could he have fingered had it got wind except ourselves and mr carlyles agents the fact was made known to none it is strange sir that you could not urge the claims of his child upon the earl rejoined the new peer to mr warburton his tone one of harsh reproof you were in his confidence you knew the state of his affairs it was in your line of duty to do it knowing the state of his affairs my lord we knew how useless the urging it would be returned mr warburton your lordship has but a faint idea of the burdens lord mount severn had upon him the interest alone upon his debts was frightfuland the deuces own work it was to get it not to speak of the kites he let loose he would fly them and nothing could stop him and they had to be provided for oh i know replied the earl with a gesture of contempt drawing one bill to cover another that was his system draw echoed mr warburton he would have drawn a bill on aldgate pump it was a downright mania with him urged to it by his necessities i conclude put in mr carlyle he had no business to have such necessities sir cried the earl wrathfully but let us proceed to business what money is there lying at his bankers mr warburton do you know none was the blank reply we overdrew the account ourselves a fortnight ago to meet one of his pressing liabilities we hold a little and had he lived a week or two longer the autumn rents would have been paid inthough they must have been as quickly paid out again im glad theres something what is the amount my lord answered mr warburton shaking his head in a selfcondoling manner i am sorry to tell you that what we hold will not half satisfy our own claims money actually paid out of our pockets then where on earth is the money to come from sir for the funeralfor the servants wagesfor everything in fact there is none to come from anywhere was the reply of mr warburton lord mount severn strode the carpet more fiercely wicked improvidence shameful profligacy calloushearted man to live a rogue and die a beggarleaving his daughter to the charity of strangers her case presents the worst feature of the whole remarked mr carlyle what will she do for a home she must of course find it with me replied his lordship and i should hope a better one than this with all these debts and duns at his elbow mount severns house could not have been a bower of roses i fancy she knew nothing of the state of affairs had seen little if anything of the embarrassments returned mr carlyle nonsense said the peer mr carlyle is right my lord observed mr warburton looking over his spectacles lady isabel was in safety at mount severn till the spring and the purchase money from east lynnewhat the earl could touch of itwas a stopgap for many things and made matters easy for the moment however his imprudences are at an end now no they are not at an end returned lord mount severn they leave their effects behind them i hear there was a fine scene yesterday morning some of the unfortunate wretches he has taken in made their appearance here all the way from town oh they are jews half of them slightingly spoke mr warburton if they do lose a little it will be an agreeable novelty to them jews have as much right to their own as we have mr warburton was the peers angry reprimand and if they were turks and infidels it would not excuse mount severns practices isabel says it was you mr carlyle who contrived to get rid of them by convincing them that east lynne and its furniture belonged to me but there are those two men upstairs in possession ofof him i could not get rid of them the earl looked at him i do not understand you did you not know that they have seized the corpse asked mr carlyle dropping his voice two men have been posted over it like sentinels since yesterday morning and theres a third in the house i hear who relieves each other by turn that they may go down in the hall and take their meals the earl had halted in his walk and drawn near to mr carlyle his mouth open his face a marvel of consternation by george was all mr warburton uttered and snatched off his glasses mr carlyle do i understand you arightthat the body of the late earl has been seized for a debt demanded the peer solemnly seize a dead body am i awake or dreaming it is what they have done they got into the room by stratagem is it possible that transactions so infamous are permitted by our law ejaculated the earl arrest a dead man i never heard of such a thing i am shocked beyond expression isabel said something about two men i remember but she was so full of grief and agitation altogether that i but half comprehended what she did say upon the subject why what will be done cant we bury him i fancy not the housekeeper told me this morning she feared they would not even suffer the coffin to be closed down and that ought to be done with all convenient speed it is perfectly horrible uttered the earl who has done itdo you know inquired mr warburton somebody of the name of anstey replied mr carlyle in the absence of any member of the family i took upon myself to pay the chamber a visit and examine into the mens authority the claim is about three thousand pounds if its anstey who has done it it is a personal debt of the earls really owing every pound of it observed mr warburton a sharp man though that anstey to hit upon such a scheme and a shameless and a scandalous man added lord mount severn well this is a pretty thing whats to be done while they consult let us look for a moment at lady isabel she sat alone in great perplexity indulging the deepest grief lord mount severn had intimated to her kindly and affectionately that henceforth she must find her home with him and his wife isabel returned a faint thank you and as soon as he left her burst into a paroxysm of rebellious tears have her home with mrs vane she uttered to her own heart no never rather would she dierather would she eat a crust and drink water and so on and so on young demoiselles are somewhat prone to indulge in these flights of fancy but they are in most cases impracticable and foolishexceedingly so in that of lady isabel vane work for their living it may appear very feasible in theory but theory and practice are as opposite as light and dark the plain fact was that isabel had no alternative whatever save that of accepting a home with lady mount severn and the conviction that it must be so stole over her spirit even while her hasty lips were protesting that she would not two mourners only attended the funeralthe earl and mr carlyle the latter was no relative of the deceased and but a very recent friend but the earl had invited him probably not liking the parading solus his trappings of woe some of the county aristocracy were pallbearers and many private carriages followed all was bustle on the following morning the earl was to depart and isabel was to depart but not together in the course of the day the domestics would disperse the earl was speeding to london and the chaise to convey him to the railway station at west lynne was already at the door when mr carlyle arrived i was getting fidgety fearing you would not be here for i have barely five minutes to spare observed the earl as he shook hands you are sure you fully understood about the tombstone perfectly replied mr carlyle </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> carlyle how is lady isabel very downhearted i fear poor child for she did not breakfast with me replied the earl mason privately told me that she was in a convulsion of grief a bad man a bad man was mount severn he emphatically added as he rose and rang the bell let lady isabel be informed that i am ready to depart and that i wait to see her he said the servant who answered it and while she is coming mr carlyle he added allow me to express my obligations to you how i should have got along in this worrying business without you i cannot divine you have promised mind to pay me a visit and i shall expect it speedily promised conditionallythat i find myself in your neighborhood smiled mr carlyle should isabel entered dressed also and ready for she was to depart immediately after the earl her crape veil was over her face but she threw it back my time is up isabel and i must go is there anything you wish to say to me she opened her lips to speak but glanced at mr carlyle and hesitated he was standing at the window his back towards them i suppose not said the earl answering himself for he was in a fever of hurry to be off like many others are when starting on a journey you will have no trouble whatever my dear only mind you get some refreshments in the middle of the day for you wont be at castle marling before dinnertime tell mrs vatell lady mount severn that i had no time to write but will do so from town but isabel stood before him in an attitude of uncertaintyof expectancy it may be said her color varying what is it you wish to say something she certainly did wish to say something but she did not know how it was a moment of embarrassment to her intensely painful and the presence of mr carlyle did not tend to lessen it the latter had no idea his absence was wished for bless me isabel i declare i forgot all about it cried the earl in a tone of vexation not being accustomed tothis aspect of affairs is so new he broke off his disjointed sentences unbuttoned his coat drew out his purse and paused over its contents isabel i have run myself very short and have but little beyond what will take me to town you must make three pounds do for now my dear once at castle marlingpound has the funds for the journeylady mount severn will supply you but you must tell her or she will not know he shot some gold out of his purse as he spoke and left two sovereigns and two half sovereigns on the table farewell my dear make yourself happy at castle marling i shall be home soon passing from the room with mr carlyle he stood talking with that gentleman a minute his foot on the step of the chaise and the next was being whisked away mr carlyle returned to the breakfastroom where isabel an ashy whiteness having replaced the crimson on her cheeks was picking up the gold will you do me a favor mr carlyle i will do anything i can for you she pushed a sovereign and a half toward him it is for mr kane i told marvel to send in and pay him but it seems she forgot it or put it off and he is not paid the tickets were a sovereign the rest is for tuning the piano will you kindly give it him if i trust one of the servants it may be forgotten again in the hurry of their departure kanes charge for tuning a piano is five shillings remarked mr carlyle but he was a long time occupied with it and did something with the leathers it is not too much besides i never ordered him anything to eat he wants money even worse than i do she added with a poor attempt at a smile but for thinking of him i should not have mustered the courage to beg of lord mount severn as you have just heard me do in that case do you know what i should have done what should you have done he smiled i should have asked you to pay him for me and i would have repaid you as soon as i had any money i had a great mind to ask you do you know it would have been less painful than being obliged to beg of lord mount severn i hope it would he answered in a low earnest tone what else can i do for you she was about to answer nothingthat he had done enough but at that moment their attention was attracted by a bustle outside and they moved to the window it was the carriage coming round for lady isabelthe late earls chariot which was to convey her to the railway station six or seven miles off it had four posthorses to it the number having been designated by lord mount severn who appeared to wish isabel to leave the neighborhood in as much state as she had entered it the carriage was packed and marvel was perched outside all is ready she said and the time is come for me to go mr carlyle i am going to leave you a legacythose pretty gold and silver fish that i bought a few weeks back but why do you not take them take them to lady mount severn no i would rather leave them with you throw a few crumbs into the globe now and then her face was wet with tears and he knew that she was talking hurriedly to cover her emotion sit down a few minutes he said nono i had better go at once he took her hand to conduct her to the carriage the servants were gathered in the hall waiting for her some had grown gray in her fathers service she put out her hand she strove to say a word of thanks and of farewell and she thought she would choke at the effort of keeping down the sobs at length it was over a kind look around a yearning wave of the hand and she passed on with mr carlyle pound had ascended to his place by marvel and the postboys were awaiting the signal to start but mr carlyle had the carriage door open again and was bending in holding her hand i have not said a word of thanks to you for all your kindness mr carlyle she cried her breath very labored i am sure you have seen that i could not i wish i could have done more i wish i could have shielded you from the annoyances you have been obliged to endure he answered should we never meet again oh but we shall meet again she interrupted you promised lord mount severn true we may so meet casuallyonce in a way but our ordinary paths in life lie far and wide apart god forever bless you dear lady isabel the postboys touched their horses and the carriage sped on she drew down the blinds and leaned back in an agony of tearstears for the house she was leaving for the father she had lost her last thoughts had been of gratitude to mr carlyle but she had more cause to be grateful to him than she yet knew of emotion soon spent itself and as her eyes cleared she saw a bit of crumpled paper lying on her lap which appeared to have fallen from her hand mechanically she took it up and opened it it was a banknote for one hundred pounds ah reader you will say that this is a romance of fiction and a farfetched one but it is verily and indeed true mr carlyle had taken it with him to east lynne that morning with its destined purpose lady isabel strained her eyes and gazed at the notegazed and gazed again where could it have come from what had brought it there suddenly the undoubted truth flashed upon her mr carlyle had left it in her hand her cheeks burned her fingers trembled her angry spirit rose up in arms in that first moment of discovery she was ready to resent it as an insult but when she came to remember the sober facts of the last few days her anger subsided into admiration of his wondrous kindness did he not know that she was without a home to call her own without moneyabsolutely without money save what would be given her in charity when lord mount severn reached london and the hotel which the vanes were in the habit of using the first object his eyes lighted on was his own wife whom he had believed to be safe at castle marling he inquired the cause lady mount severn gave herself little trouble to explain she had been up a day or twocould order her mourning so much better in personand william did not seem well so she bought him up for a change i am sorry you came to town emma remarked the earl after listening isabel is gone today to castle marling lady mount severn quickly lifted her head whats she gone there for it is the most disgraceful piece of business altogether returned the earl without replying to the immediate question mount severn has died worse than a beggar and theres not a shilling for isabel it never was expected there would be much but theres nothingnot a penny nothing for her own personal expenses i gave her a pound or two today for she was completely destitute the countess opened her eyes where will she live what will become of her she must live with us she with us interrupted lady mount severn her voice almost reaching a scream that she never shall she must emma there is nowhere else for her to live i have been obliged to decide it so and she is gone as i tell you to castle marling today lady mount severn grew pale with anger she rose from her seat and confronted her husband the table being between them listen raymond i will not have isabel vane under my roof i hate her how could you be cajoled into sanctioning such a thing i was not cajoled and my sanction was not asked he mildly replied i proposed it where else is she to be i dont care where was the obstinate retort never with us she is at castle marling nowgone to it as her home resumed the earl and even you when you return will scarcely venture to turn her out again into the road or to the workhouse she will not trouble you long carelessly continued the earl one so lovely as isabel will be sure to marry early and she appears as gentle and sweettempered a girl as i ever saw so whence can arise your dislike to her i dont pretend to guess many a man will be ready to forget her want of fortune for the sake of her face she shall marry the first who asks her snapped the angry lady ill take care of that </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xii life at castle marling isabel had been in her new home about ten days when lord and lady mount severn arrived at castle marling which was not a castle you may as well be told but only the name of a town nearly contiguous to which was their residence a small estate lord mount severn welcomed isabel lady mount severn also after a fashion but her manner was so repellant so insolently patronizing that it brought the indignant crimson to the cheeks of lady isabel and if this was the case at the first meeting what do you suppose it must have been as time went on galling slights petty vexations chilling annoyances were put upon her trying her powers of endurance to the very length of their tether she would wring her hands when alone and passionately wish that she could find another refuge the earl and countess had two children both boys and in february the younger </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> younger one always a delicate child died this somewhat altered their plans instead of proceeding to london after easter as had been decided upon they would not go till may the earl had passed part of the winter at mount severn looking after the repairs and renovations that were being made there in march he went to paris full of grief for the loss of his boyfar greater grief than was experienced by lady mount severn april approached and with it easter to the unconcealed dismay of lady mount severn her grandmother mrs levison wrote her word that she required change and should pass easter with her at castle marling lady mount severn would have given her diamonds to have got out of it but there was no escapediamonds that were once isabelsat least that isabel had worn on the monday in passion week the old lady arrived and with her francis levison they had no other guests things went on pretty smoothly till good friday on good friday afternoon isabel strolled out with little william vane captain levison joined them and they never came in till nearly dinnertime when the three entered together lady mount severn doing penance all the time and nursing her rage against isabel for mrs levison kept her indoors there was barely time to dress for dinner and isabel went straight to her room her dress was off her dressinggown on marvel was busy with her hair and william chattering at her knee when the door was flung open and my lady entered where have you been demanded she shaking with passion isabel knew the signs strolling about in the shrubberies and grounds answered isabel how dare you so disgrace yourself i do not understand you said isabel her heart beginning to beat unpleasantly marvel you are pulling my hair when women liable to intemperate fits of passion give the reins to them they neither know nor care what they say lady mount severn broke into a torrent of reproach and abuses most degrading and unjustifiable is it not sufficient that you are allowed an asylum in my house but you must also disgrace it three hours have you been hiding yourself with francis levison you have done nothing but flirt with him from the moment he came you did nothing else at christmas the attack was longer and broader but that was the substance of it and isabel was goaded to resistance to anger little less great than that of the countess thisand before her attendant she an earls daughter so much better born than emma mount severn to be thus insultingly accused in the others mad jealousy isabel tossed her hair from the hands of marvel rose up and confronted the countess constraining her voice to calmness i do not flirt she said i have never flirted i leave thatand she could not wholly suppress in tone the scorn she feltto married women though it seems to me that it is a fault less venial in them than in single ones there is but one inmate of this house who flirts so far as i have seen since i have lived in it is it you or i lady mount severn the home truth told on her ladyship she turned white with rage forgot her manners and raising her right hand struck isabel a stinging blow upon the left cheek confused and terrified isabel stood in pain and before she could speak or act my ladys left hand was raised to the other cheek and a blow left on that lady isabel shivered as with a sudden chill and cried outa sharp quick crycovered her outraged face and sank down upon the dressing chair marvel threw up her hands in dismay and william vane could not have burst into a louder roar had he been beaten himself the boyhe was of a sensitive naturewas frightened my good reader are you one of the inexperienced ones who borrow notions of fashionable life from the novels got in a library taking their highflown contents for gospel and religiously believing that lords and ladies live upon stilts speak eat move breathe by the rules of goodbreeding only are you under the delusiontoo many arethat the days of dukes and duchesses are spent discussing pictures tastes shakespeare and the musical glassesthat they are strung on polite wires of silver and cant get off the hinges never giving vent to angry tempers to words unorthodox as commonplace mortals do that will come to pass when the great creator shall see fit to send men into the world free from baneful tempers evil passions from the sins bequeathed from the fall of adam lady mount severn finished up the scene by boxing william for his noise jerked him out of the room and told him he was a monkey isabel vane lived through the livelong night weeping tears of anguish and indignation she would not remain at castle marlingwho would after so great an outrage yet where was she to go fifty times in the course of the night did she wish that she was laid beside her father for her feelings obtained the mastery of her reason in her calm moments she would have shrunk from the idea of death as the young and healthy must do she rose on the saturday morning weak and languid the effects of the night of grief and marvel brought her breakfast up william vane stole into her room afterward he was attached to her in a remarkable degree mammas going out he exclaimed in the course of the morning look isabel isabel went to the window lady mount severn was in the pony carriage francis levison driving we can go down now isabel nobody will be there she assented and went down with william but scarcely were they in the drawingroom when a servant entered with a card on a salver a gentleman my lady wishes to see you to see me returned isabel in surprise or lady mount severn he asked for you my lady she took up the card mr carlyle oh she uttered in a tone of joyful surprise show him in it is curious nay appalling to trace the thread in a human life how the most trivial occurrences lead to the great events of existence bringing forth happiness or misery weal or woe a client of mr carlyles travelling from one part of england to the other was arrested by illness at castle marlinggrave illness it appeared to be inducing fears of death he had not as the phrase goes settled his affairs and mr carlyle was telegraphed for in haste to make his will and for other private matters a very simple occurrence it appeared to mr carlyle this journey and yet it was destined to lead to events that would end only with his own life mr carlyle entered unaffected and gentlemanly as ever with his noble form his attractive face and his drooping eyelids she advanced to meet him holding out her hand her countenance betraying her pleasure this is indeed unexpected she exclaimed how very pleased i am to see you business brought me yesterday to castle marling i could not leave it again without calling on you i hear that lord mount severn is absent he is in france she rejoined i said we should be sure to meet again do you remember mr carlyle you isabel suddenly stopped for with the word remember she also remembered somethingthe hundred pound noteand what she was saying faltered on her tongue confused indeed grew she for alas she had changed and partly spent it how was it possible to ask lady mount severn for money and the earl was nearly always away mr carlyle saw her embarrassment though he may not have detected its cause what a fine boy exclaimed he looking at the child it is lord vane said isabel a truthful earnest spire i am sure he continued gazing at his open countenance how old are you my little man i am six sir and my brother was four isabel bent over the childan excuse to cover her perplexity you do not know this gentleman william it is mr carlyle and he has been very kind to me the little lord had turned his thoughtful eyes on mr carlyle apparently studying his countenance i shall like you sir if you are kind to isabel are you kind to her very very kind murmured lady isabel leaving william and turning to mr carlyle but not looking at him i dont know what to say i ought to thank you i did not intend to use theto use it but ii hush he interrupted laughing at her confusion i do not know what you are talking of i have a great misfortune to break to you lady isabel she lifted her eyes and her glowing cheeks somewhat aroused from her own thoughts two of your fish are dead the gold ones are they i believe it was the frost killed them i dont know what else it could have been you may remember those bitter days we had in january they died then you are very good to take care of them all this while how is east lynne looking dear east lynne is it occupied not yet i have spent some money upon it and it repays the outlay the excitement of his arrival had worn off and she was looking herself again pale and sad he could not help observing that she was changed i cannot expect to look so well at castle marling as i did at east lynne she answered i trust it is a happy home to you said mr carlyle speaking upon impulse she glanced up at him a look that he would never forget it certainly told of despair no she said shaking her head it is a miserable home and i cannot remain in it i have been awake all night thinking where i can go but i cannot tell i have not a friend in the wide world never let people talk secrets before children for be assured that they comprehend a vast deal more than is expedient the saying that little pitchers have great ears is wonderfully true lord vane held up his hand to mr carlyle isabel told me this morning that she should go away from us shall i tell you why mamma beat her yesterday when she was angry be quiet william interrupted lady isabel her face in a flame two great slaps upon her cheeks continued the young viscount and isabel cried so and i screamed and then mamma hit me but boys are made to be hit nurse says so marvel came into the nursery when we were at tea and told nurse about it she says isabels too goodlooking and thats why mamma isabel stopped the childs tongue rang a peal on the bell and marched him to the door dispatching him to the nursery by the servant who answered it mr carlyles eyes were full of indignant sympathy can this be true he asked in a low tone when she returned to him you do indeed want a friend i must bear my lot she replied obeying the impulse which prompted her to confide in mr carlyle at least till lord mount severn returns and then i really do not know she said the rebellious tears rising faster than she could choke them down he has no other home to offer me but with lady mount severn i cannot and will not remain she would break my heart as she has already wellnigh broken my spirit i have not deserved it of her mr carlyle no i am sure you have not he warmly answered i wish i could help you what can i do you can do nothing she said what can any one do i wish i wish i could help you he repeated east lynne was not take it for all in all a pleasant home to you but it seems you changed for the worse when you left not a pleasant home she echoed its reminiscences appearing delightful in that moment for it must be remembered that all things are estimated by comparison indeed it was i may </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> may never have so pleasant a one again mr carlyle do not disparage east lynne to me would i could awake and find the last few months but a hideous dreamthat i could find my dear father alive againthat we were still living peacefully at east lynne it would be a very eden to me now what was mr carlyle about to say what emotion was it that agitated his countenance impeded his breath and dyed his face bloodred his better genius was surely not watching over him or those words had never been spoken there is but one way he began taking her hand and nervously playing with it probably unconscious that he did so only one way in which you could return to east lynne and that wayi may not presume perhaps to point it out she looked at him and waited for an explanation if my words offend you lady isabel check them as their presumption deserves and pardon me may idare ioffer you to return to east lynne as its mistress she did not comprehend him in the slightest degree the drift of his meaning never dawned upon her return to east lynne as its mistress she repeated in bewilderment and as my wife no possibility of misunderstanding him now and the shock and surprise were great she had stood there by mr carlyles side conversing confidentially with him esteeming him greatly feeling as if he were her truest friend on earth clinging to him in her heart as to a powerful haven of refuge loving him almost as she would a brother suffering her hand to remain in his but to be his wife the idea had never presented itself to her in any shape until this moment and her minds first emotion was one of entire opposition her first movement to express it as she essayed to withdraw herself and her hand away from him but not so mr carlyle did not suffer it he not only retained that hand but took the other also and spoke now the ice was broken eloquent words of love not unmeaning phrases of rhapsody about hearts and darts and dying for her such as somebody else might have given utterance to but earnesthearted words of deep tenderness calculated to win upon the minds good sense as well as upon the ear and heart and it may be that had her imagination not been filled up with that somebody else she would have said yes there and then they were suddenly interrupted lady mount severn entered and took in the scene at a glance mr carlyles bent attitude of devotion his imprisonment of the hands and isabels perplexed and blushing countenance she threw up her head and her little inquisitive nose and stopped short on the carpet her freezing looks demanded an explanation as plainly as looks can do it mr carlyle turned to her and by way of sparing isabel proceeded to introduce himself isabel had just presence of mind left to name her lady mount severn i am sorry that lord mount severn should be absent to whom i have the honor of being known he said i am mr carlyle i have heard of you replied her ladyship scanning his good looks and feeling cross that his homage should be given where she saw it was given but i had not heard that you and lady isabel vane were on the extraordinary terms of intimacy thatthat madam he interrupted as he handed a chair to her ladyship and took another himself we have never yet been on terms of extraordinary intimacy i was begging the lady isabel to grant that we may be i was asking her to become my wife the avowal was as a shower of incense to the countess and her ill humor melted into sunshine it was a solution to her great difficulty a loophole by which she might get rid of her bete noire the hated isabel a flush of gratification lighted her face and she became full of graciousness to mr carlyle how very grateful isabel must feel to you quoth she i speak openly mr carlyle because i know that you were cognizant of the unprotected state in which she was left by the earls improvidence putting marriage for her at any rate a high marriage nearly out of the question east lynne is a beautiful place i have heard for its size it is not large replied mr carlyle as he rose for isabel had also risen and was coming forward and pray what is lady isabels answer quickly asked the countess turning to her not to her did isabel condescend to give an answer but she approached mr carlyle and spoke in a low tone will you give me a few hours for consideration i am only too happy that you should accord it consideration for it speaks to me of hope was his reply as he opened the door for her to pass out i will be here again this afternoon it was a perplexing debate that lady isabel held with herself in the solitude of her chamber whilst mr carlyle touched upon ways and means to lady mount severn isabel was little more than a child and as a child she reasoned looking neither far nor deep the shallow palpable aspect of affairs alone presenting itself to her view that mr carlyle was not of rank equal to her own she scarcely remembered east lynne seemed a very fair settlement in life and in point of size beauty and importance it was far superior to the house she was now in she forgot that her position in east lynne as mr carlyles wife would not be what it had been as lord mount severns daughter she forgot that she would be tied to a quiet house shut out from the great world the pomps and vanities to which she was born she liked mr carlyle much she experienced pleasure in conversing with him she liked to be with him in short but for that other illomened fancy which had crept over her there would have been danger of her falling in love with mr carlyle and oh to be removed forever from the bitter dependence on lady mount severneast lynne would in truth after that seem what she had called it eden so far it looks favorable mentally exclaimed poor isabel but there is the other side of the question it is not only that i do not love mr carlyle but i fear i do love or very nearly love francis levison i wish he would ask me to be his wifeor that i had never seen him isabels soliloquy was interrupted by the entrance of mrs levison and the countess what the latter had said to the old lady to win her to the cause was best known to herself but she was eloquent in it they both used every possible argument to induce her to accept mr carlyle the old lady declaring that she had never been introduced to any one she was so much taken with and mrs levison was incapable of asserting what was not true that he was worth a dozen emptyheaded men of the great world isabel listened now swayed one way now the other and when afternoon came her head was aching with perplexity the stumbling block that she could not get over was francis levison she saw mr carlyle approach from her window and went down to the drawingroom not in the least knowing what her answer was to be a shadowy idea was presenting itself that she would ask him for longer time and write her answer in the drawingroom was francis levison and her heart beat wildly which said beating might have convinced her that she ought not to marry another where have you been hiding yourself cried he did you hear of our mishap with the pony carriage no was her answer i was driving emma into town the pony took fright kicked plunged and went down upon his knees she took fright in turn got out and walked back so i gave the brute some chastisement and a race and brought him to the stables getting home in time to be introduced to mr carlyle he seems an outandout good fellow isabel and i congratulate you what she uttered dont start we are all in the family and my lady told i wont betray it abroad she says east lynne is a place to be coveted i wish you happiness isabel thank you she returned in a sarcastic tone though her throat beat and her lips quivered you are premature in your congratulations captain levison am i keep my good wishes then till the right man comes i am beyond the pale myself and dare not think of entering the happy state he added in a pointed tone i have indulged dreams of it like others but i cannot afford to indulge them seriously a poor man with uncertain prospects can only play the butterfly perhaps to his lifes end he quitted the room as he spoke it was impossible for isabel to misunderstand him but a feeling shot across her mind for the first time that he was false and heartless one of the servants appeared showing in mr carlyle nothing false or heartless about him he closed the door and approached her but she did not speak and her lips were white and trembling mr carlyle waited well he said at length in a gentle tone have you decided to grant my prayer yes but she could not go on what with one agitation and another she had difficulty in conquering her emotion buti was going to tell you presently he whispered leading her to a sofa we can both afford to wait now oh isabel you have made me very happy i ought to tell you i must tell you she began again in the midst of hysterical tears though i have said yes to your proposal i do notyetit has come upon me by surprise she stammered i like you very much i esteem and respect you but i do not love you i should wonder if you did but you will let me earn your love isabel oh yes she earnestly answered i hope so he drew her closer to him bent his face and took from her lips his first kiss isabel was passive she supposed he had gained the right to do so my dearest it is all i ask </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiii a moonlight walk the sensations of mr carlyle when he returned to west lynne were much like those of an eton boy who knows he has been in mischief and dreads detection always open as to his own affairsfor he had nothing to concealhe yet deemed it expedient to dissemble now he felt that his sister would be bitter at the prospect of his marrying instinct had taught him that years past and he believed that of all women the most objectionable to her would be lady isabel for miss carlyle looked to the useful and had neither sympathy nor admiration for the beautiful he was not sure but she might be capable of endeavoring to frustrate the marriage should news of it reach her ears and her indomitable will had caused many strange things in her life therefore you will not blame mr carlyle for observing entire reticence as to his future plans a family of the name of carew had been about taking east lynne they wished to rent it furnished for three years upon some of the minor arrangements they and mr carlyle were opposed but the latter declined to give way during his absence at castle marling news had arrived from themthey had acceded to all his terms and would enter upon east lynne as soon as it was convenient miss carlyle was full of congratulations it was off their hands she said but the fist letter mr carlyle wrote wasto decline them he did not tell this to miss carlyle the final touches to the house were given preparatory to the reception of its inhabitants and three maids and two men servants hired and sent there upon board wages until the family should </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> should arrive one evening three weeks subsequent to mr carlyles visit to castle marling barbara hare called at miss carlyles and found them going to tea much earlier than usual we dined earlier said miss corny and i ordered tea as soon as the dinner went away otherwise archibald would have taken none i am as well without tea and i have a mass of business to get through yet you are not as well without it cried miss corny and i dont choose you should go without it take off your bonnet barbara he does things like nobody else he is off to castle marling tomorrow and never could open his lips till just now that he was going is that invalidbrewster or whatever his name islaid up at castle marling still exclaimed barbara he is still there said mr carlyle barbara sprang up the moment tea was over dill is waiting for me in the office and i have some hours work before me however i suppose you wont care to put up with peters attendance so make haste with your bonnet barbara she took his arm and they walked on mr carlyle striking the hedge and the grass with her parasol another minute and the handle was in two i thought you would do it said barbara while he was regarding the parasol with ludicrous dismay never mind it is an old one i will bring you another to replace it what is the color brown i wont forget hold the relics a minute barbara he put the pieces in her hand and taking out a note case made a note in pencil whats that for she inquired he held it close to her eyes that she might discern what he had written brown parasol b h a reminder for me barbara in case i forget barbaras eyes detected another item or two already entered in the note case piano plate i jot down the things as they occur to me that i must get in london he explained otherwise i should forget half in london i thought you were going in an opposite directionto castle marling it was a slip of the tongue but mr carlyle repaired it i may probably have to visit london as well as castle marling how bright the moon looks rising there barbara so brightthat or the skythat i saw your secret answered she piano plate what can you want with either archibald they are for east lynne he quietly replied oh for the carews and barbaras interest in the item was gone they turned into the road just below the grove and reached it mr carlyle held the gate open for barbara you will come in and say goodnight to mamma she was saying today what a stranger you have made of yourself lately i have been busy and i really have not the time tonight you must remember me to her instead and cordially shaking her by the hand he closed the gate it was two or three mornings after the departure of mr carlyle that mr dill appeared before miss carlyle bearing a letter she was busy regarding the effect of some new muslin curtains just put up and did not pay attention to him will you please take the letter miss cornelia the postman left it in the office with ours it is from mr archibald why what has he got to write to me about retorted miss corny does he say when he is coming home you had better see miss cornelia mine does not castle marling may 1st my dear corneliai was married this morning to lady isabel vane and hasten briefly to acquaint you with the fact i will write you more fully tomorrow or the next day and explain all things your ever affectionate brother archibald carlyle it is a hoax was the first gutteral sound that escaped from miss carlyles throat when speech came to her mr dill only stood like a stone image it is a hoax i say raved miss carlyle what are you standing there for like a gander on one leg she reiterated venting her anger upon the unoffending man is it a hoax or not i am overdone with amazement miss corny it is not a hoax i have had a letter too it cant be trueit cant be true he had no more thought of being married when he left here three days ago than i have how can we tell that miss corny how are we to know he did not go to be married i fancy he did go to be married shrieked miss corny in a passion he would not be such a fool and to that fine ladychild nono he has sent this to be put in the county journals said mr dill holding forth a scrap of paper they are married safe enough miss carlyle took it and held it before her her hand was cold as ice and shook as if with palsy marriedon the 1st inst at castle marling by the chaplain to the earl of mount severn archibald carlyle esquire of east lynne to the lady isabel mary vane only child of william late earl of mount severn miss carlyle tore the paper to atoms and scattered it mr dill afterward made copies from memory and sent them to the journal offices but let that pass i will never forgive him she deliberately uttered and i will never forgive or tolerate her </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xiv the earls astonishment the announcement of the marriage in the newspapers was the first intimation of it lord mount severn received he was little less thunderstruck than miss corny and came steaming to england the same day thereby missing his wifes letter which gave her version of the affair he met mr carlyle and lady isabel in london where they were staying at one of the westend hotelsonly for a day or two however for they were going further isabel was alone when the earl was announced what is the meaning of this isabel began he without the circumlocution of greeting you are married yes she answered with her pretty innocent blush some time ago and to carlyle the lawyer how did it come about isabel began to think how it did come about sufficiently to give a clear answer he asked me she said and i accepted him he came to castle marling at easter and asked me then i was very much surprised the earl looked at her attentively why was i kept in ignorance of this isabel i did not know you were kept in ignorance of it mr carlyle wrote to you as did lady mount severn lord mount severn was a man in the dark and looked like it i suppose this comes soliloquized he aloud of your fathers having allowed the gentleman to dance daily attendance at east lynne and so you fell in love with him indeed no answered she in an amused tone i never thought of such a thing as falling in love with mr carlyle then dont you love him abruptly asked the earl no she whispered timidly but i like him muchoh very much and he is so good to me the earl stroked his chin and mused isabel had destroyed the only reasonable conclusion he had been able to come to as to the motives for the hasty marriage if you do not love mr carlyle how comes it that you are so wise in the distinction between liking and love it cannot be that you love anybody else the question turned home and isabel turned crimson i shall love my husband in time was all she answered as she bent her head and played nervously with her watch chain my poor child involuntarily exclaimed the earl but he was one who liked to fathom the depth of everything who has been staying at castle marling since i left he asked sharply mrs levison came down i alluded to gentlemenyoung men only francis levison she replied francis levison you have never been so foolish as to fall in love with him the question was so pointed so abrupt and isabels selfconsciousness moreover so great that she betrayed lamentable confusion and the earl had no further need to ask pity stole into his hard eyes as they fixed themselves on her downcast glowing face isabel he gravely began captain levison is not a good man if ever you were inclined to think him one dispossess your mind of the idea and hold him at arms distance drop his acquaintanceencourage no intimacy with him i have already dropped it said isabel and i shall not take it up again but lady mount severn must think well of him or she would not have him there she thinks none too well of him none can of francis levison returned the earl significantly before isabel could reply mr carlyle entered he held out his hand to the earl the earl did not appear to see it isabel said he i am sorry to turn you out but i suppose you have but this one sittingroom i wish to say a few words to mr carlyle she quitted them and the earl wheeled round and faced mr carlyle speaking in a stern haughty tone how came this marriage about sir do you possess so little honor that taking advantage of my absence you must intrude yourself into my family and clandestinely espouse lady isabel vane mr carlyle stood confounded and confused he drew himself up to his full height looking every whit as fearless and far more noble than the peer my lord i do not understand you yet i speak plainly what is it but a clandestine procedure to take advantage of a guardians absence and beguile a young girl into a marriage beneath her there has been nothing clandestine in my conduct toward lady isabel vane there shall be nothing but honor in my conduct toward lady isabel carlyle your lordship has been misinformed i have not been informed at all retorted the earl i was allowed to learn this from the public papersi the only relative of lady isabel when i proposed for lady isabel but a month ago sarcastically interrupted the earl but a month ago calmly repeated mr carlyle my first action after isabel accepted me was to write to you but that i imagine you may not have received the letter by stating you first heard of our marriage through the papers i should say the want of courtesy lay on your lordships side for having vouchsafed me no reply to it what were the contents of the letter i stated what had occurred mentioning what i was able to do in the way of settlements and also that both isabel and myself wished the ceremony to take place as soon as might be and pray where did you address the letter lady mount severn could not give me the address she said if i would intrust the letter to her she would forward it with the rest she wrote for she expected daily to hear from you i did give her the letter and i heard no more of the matter except that her ladyship sent me a message when isabel was writing to me that as you had returned no reply you of course approved is this the fact cried the earl my lord coldly replied mr carlyle whatever may be my defects in your eyes i am at least a man of truth until this moment the suspicion that you were in ignorance of the contemplated marriage never occurred to me so far then i beg your pardon mr carlyle but how came the marriage about at allhow came it to be hurried over in this unseemly fashion you made the offer at easter isabel tells me and you married her three weeks after it and i would have married her and brought her away with me the day i did make it had it been practicable returned mr carlyle i have acted throughout for her comfort and happiness oh indeed exclaimed the earl returning to his disagreeable tone perhaps you will put me in possession of the facts and of your motives i </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> i warn you that the facts to you will not bear a pleasant sound lord mount severn allow me to be the judge of that said the earl business took me to castle marling on good friday on the following day i called at your house after your own and isabels invitation it was natural i should in fact it would have been a breach of good feeling not to do so i found isabel illtreated and miserable far from enjoying a happy home in your house what sir interrupted the earl illtreated and miserable illtreated even to blows my lord the earl stood as one petrified staring at mr carlyle i learnt it i must premise through the chattering revelations of your little son isabel of course would not have mentioned it to me but when the child had spoken she did not deny it in short she was too brokenhearted too completely bowed in spirit to deny it it aroused all my feelings of indignationit excited in me an irresistible desire to emancipate her from this cruel life and take her where she would find affection and i hope happiness there was only one way which i could do this and i risked it i asked her to become my wife and to return to her home at east lynne the earl was slowly recovering from his petrifaction then am i to understand that when you called that day at my house you carried no intention with you of proposing to isabel not any it was an impromptu step the circumstances under which i found her calling it forth the earl paced the room perplexed still and evidently disturbed may i inquire if you love her he abruptly said mr carlyle paused ere he spoke and a red flush dyed his face those sort of feelings man rarely acknowledges to man lord mount severn but i will answer you i do love her passionately and sincerely i learnt to love her at east lynne but i could have carried my love silently within me to the end of my life and never betrayed it and probably should have done so but for the unexpected visit to castle marling if the idea of making her my wife had never previously occurred to me as practicable it was that i deemed her rank incompatible with my own as it was said the earl country solicitors have married peers daughters before now remarked mr carlyle i only add another to the list but you cannot keep her as a peers daughter i presume east lynne will be her home our establishment will be small and quiet as compared with her fathers i explained to isabel how quiet at the first and she might have retracted had she wished i explained also in full to lady mount severn east lynne will descend to our eldest son should we have children my profession is most lucrative my income good were i to die tomorrow isabel would enjoy east lynne and about three thousand pounds per annum i gave these details in the letter which appears to have miscarried the earl made no immediate reply he was absorbed in thought your lordship perceives i hope that there has been nothing clandestine in my conduct to lady isabel lord mount severn held out his hand i refused my hand when you came in mr carlyle as you may have observed perhaps you will refuse yours now though i should be proud to shake it when i find myself in the wrong i am not above acknowledging the fact and i must state my opinion that you have behaved most kindly and honorably mr carlyle smiled and put his hand into the earls the latter retained it while he spoke in a whisper of course i cannot be ignorant that in speaking of isabels illtreatment you alluded to my wife has it transpired beyond yourselves you may be sure that neither isabel nor myself would mention it we shall dismiss it from among our reminiscences let it be as though you had never heard it it is past and done with isabel said the earl as he was departing that evening for he remained to spend the day with them i came here this morning almost prepared to strike your husband and i go away honoring him be a good and faithful wife to him for he deserves it of course i shall she answered in surprise lord mount severn steamed on to castle marling and there he had a stormy interview with his wifeso stormy that the sounds penetrated to the ears of the domestics he left again the same day in anger and proceeded to mount severn he will have time to cool down before we meet in london was the comment of my lady </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xv coming home miss carlyle having resolved upon her course quitted her own house and removed to east lynne with peter and her handmaidens in spite of mr dills grieved remonstrances she discharged the servants whom mr carlyle had engaged all save one man on a friday night about a month after the wedding mr carlyle and his wife came home they were expected and miss carlyle went through the hall to receive them and stood on the upper steps between the pillars of the portico an elegant chariot with four posthorses was drawing up miss carlyle compressed her lips as she scanned it she was attired in a handsome dark silk dress and a new cap her anger had had time to cool down in the last month and her strong common sense told her that the wiser plan would be to make the best of it mr carlyle came up the steps with isabel you here cornelia that was kind how are you isabel this is my sister lady isabel put forth her hand and miss carlyle condescended to touch the tips of her fingers i hope you are well maam she jerked out mr carlyle left them together and went back to search for some trifles which had been left in the carriage miss carlyle led the way to a sittingroom where the suppertray was laid you would like to go upstairs and take your things off before upper maam she said in the same jerking tone to lady isabel thank you i will go to my rooms but i do not require supper we have dined then what would you like to take asked miss corny some tea if you please i am very thirsty tea ejaculated miss corny so late as this i dont know that they have boiling water youd never sleep a wink all night maam if you took tea at eleven oclock oh then never mind replied lady isabel it is of no consequence do not let me give trouble miss carlyle whisked out of the room upon what errand was best known to herself and in the hall she and marvel came to an encounter no words passed but each eyed the other grimly marvel was very stylish with five flounces to her dress a veil and a parasol meanwhile lady isabel sat down and burst into bitter tears and sobs a chill had come over her it did not seem like coming to east lynne mr carlyle entered and witnessed the grief isabel he uttered in amazement as he hastened up to her my darling what ails you i am tired i think she gently answered and coming into the house again made me think of papa i should like to go to my rooms archibald but i dont know which they are neither did mr carlyle know but miss carlyle came whisking in again and said the best rooms those next the library should she go up with my lady mr carlyle preferred to go himself and he held out his arm to isabel she drew her veil over her face as she passed miss carlyle the branches were not lighted and the room looked cold and comfortless things seem all sixes and sevens in the house remarked mr carlyle i fancy the servants must have misunderstood my letter and not have expected us until tomorrow night on returning to the sittingroom mr carlyle inquired the cause of the servants negligence i sent them away because they were superfluous encumbrances hastily replied miss carlyle we have four in the house and my lady has brought a fine maid i see making five i have come up here to live mr carlyle felt checkmated he had always bowed to the will of miss corny but he had an idea that he and his wife should be better without her and your house he exclaimed i have let it furnished the people enter today so you cannot turn me out of east lynne into the road or to furnished lodgings archibald therell be enough expense without our keeping on two houses and most people in your place would jump at the prospect of my living here your wife will be mistress i do not intend to take her honors from her but i will save her a world of trouble in managementbe as useful to her as a housekeeper she will be glad of that inexperienced as she is i dare say she never gave a domestic order in her life this was a view of the case to mr carlyle so plausibly put that he began to think it might be all for the best he had great reverence for his sisters judgment force of habit is strong upon all of us still he did not know did you buy that fine piano which has arrived angrily asked miss carlyle it was my present to isabel miss corny groaned what did it cost the cost is of no consequence the old piano here was a bad one and i bought a better what did it cost repeated miss carlyle a hundred and twenty guineas he answered obedience to her will was yet powerful within him miss corny threw up her hands and eyes but at that moment peter entered with some hot water which his master had rung for mr carlyle rose and looked on the sideboard where is the wine peter the servant put it out port and sherry mr carlyle drank a glass and then proceeded to mix some wine and water shall i mix some for you cornelia he asked ill mix for myself if i want any whos that for isabel he quitted the room carrying the wine and water and entered his wifes she was sitting half buried it seemed in the armchair her face muffled up as she raised it he saw that it was flushed and agitated that her eyes were bright and her frame was trembling what is the matter he hastily asked i got nervous after marvel went she whispered laying hold of him as if for protection from terror i came back to the chair and covered my head over hoping some one would come up i have been talking to cornelia but what made you nervous oh i was very foolish i kept thinking of frightful things they would come into my mind do not blame me archibald this is the room papa died in blame you my darling he uttered with deep feeling i thought of a dreadful story about the bats that the servants toldi dare say you never heard it and i kept thinking suppose they were at the windows now behind the blinds and then i was afraid to look at the bed i fancied i might seeyou are laughing yes he was smiling for he knew that these moments of nervous fear are best met jestingly he made her drink the wine and water and then he showed her where the bell was ringing it as he did so its position had been changed in some late alterations to the house your rooms shall be changed tomorrow isabel no let us remain in these i shall like to feel that papa was once their occupant i wont get nervous again but even as she spoke her actions belied her words mr carlyle had gone to the door and opened it and she flew close up to him cowering </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> cowering behind him shall you be gone very long archibald she whispered not more than an hour he answered but he hastily put back one of his hands and held her tightly in his protecting grasp marvel was coming along the corridor in answer to the ring have the goodness to let miss carlyle know that i am not coming down again tonight he said yes sir mr carlyle shut the door and then looked at his wife and laughed he is very kind to me thought isabel with the morning began the perplexities of lady isabel carlyle but first of all just fancy the group at breakfast miss carlyle descended in the startling costume the reader has seen took her seat at the breakfasttable and there sat bolt upright mr carlyle came down next and then lady isabel entered in an elegant halfmourning dress with flowing black ribbons good morning maam i hope you slept well was miss carlyles salutation quite well thank you she answered as she took her seat opposite miss carlyle miss carlyle pointed to the top of the table that is your place maam but i will pour out the coffee and save you the trouble if you wish it i should be glad if you would answered lady isabel so miss carlyle proceeded to her duties very stern and grim the meal was nearly over when peter came in and said the butcher had come up for orders miss carlyle looked at lady isabel waiting of course for her to give them isabel was silent with perplexity she had never given such an order in her life totally ignorant was she of the requirements of a household and did not know whether to suggest a few pounds of meat or a whole cow it was the presence of that grim miss corny which put her out alone with her husband she would have said what ought i to order archibald tell me peter waited asomething to roast and boil if you please stammered lady isabel she spoke in a low tone embarrassment makes cowards of us and mr carlyle repeated it after her he knew no more about housekeeping than she did something to roast and boil tell the man peter up started miss corny she could not stand that are you aware lady isabel that an order such as that would only puzzle the butcher shall i give the necessary orders for today the fishmonger will be here presently oh i wish you would cried the relieved lady isabel i have not been accustomed to it but i must learn i dont think i know anything about housekeeping miss cornys answer was to stalk from the room isabel rose from her chair like a bird released from its cage and stood by his side have you finished archibald i think i have dear oh heres my coffee there i have finished now let us go around the grounds he rose laid his hands playfully on her slender waist and looked at her you may as well ask me to take a journey to the moon it is past nine and i have not been to the office for a month the tears rose in her eyes i wish you would be always with me east lynne will not be east lynne without you i will be with you as much as ever i can my dearest he whispered come and walk with me through the park she ran for her bonnet gloves and parasol mr carlyle waited for her in the hall and they went out together he thought it a good opportunity to speak about his sister she wishes to remain with us he said i do not know what to decide on the one hand i think she might save you the worry of household management on the other i fancy we shall be happier by ourselves isabels heart sank within her at the idea of that stern miss corny mounted over her as resident guard but refined and sensitive almost painfully considerate of the feelings of others she raised no word of objection as you and miss carlyle please she answered isabel he said i wish it to be as you please i wish matters to be arranged as may best please you and i will have them so arranged my chief object in life now is your happiness he spoke in all the sincerity of truth and isabel knew it and the thought came across her that with him by her side her loving protector miss carlyle could not mar her lifes peace let her stay archibald she will not incommode us at any rate it can be tried for a month or two and we shall see how it works he musingly observed they reached the park gates i wish i could go with you and be your clerk she cried unwilling to release his hand i should not have all that long way to go back by myself he laughed and shook his head telling her that she wanted to bribe him into taking her back but it could not be and away he went after saying farewell </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvi domestic troubles isabel wandered back and then wandered through the rooms they looked lovely not as they had seemed to look in her fathers time in her dressingroom knelt marvel unpacking she rose when lady isabel entered can i speak to you a moment if you please my lady what is it then marvel poured forth her tale that she feared so small an establishment would not suit her and if my lady pleased she would like to leave at oncethat day anticipating it she had not unpacked her things there has been some mistake about the servants marvel but it will be remedied as soon as possible and i told you before i married that mr carlyles establishment would be a limited one my lady perhaps i could put up with that but i never could stop in the house with that female guy had been on the tip of marvels tongue but she remembered in time of whom she was speakingwith miss carlyle i fear my lady we have both got tempers that would slash and might be flying at each other i could not stop my lady for untold gold and if you please to make me forfeit my running months salary why i must do it so when i have set your ladyships things to rights i hope youll allow me to go lady isabel would not condescend to ask her to remain but she wondered how she should manage the inconvenience she drew her desk toward her what is the amount due to you she inquired as she unlocked it up to the end of the quarter my lady cried marvel in a brisk tone no coldly answered lady isabel up to today i have not had time to reckon my lady lady isabel took a pencil and paper made out the account and laid it down in gold and silver on the table it is more than you deserve marvel she remarked and more than you would get in most places you ought to have given me proper notice marvel melted into tears and began a string of excuses she should never have wished to leave so kind a lady but for attendant illconveniences and she hoped my lady would not object to testify to her character lady isabel quitted the room in the midst of it and in the course of the day marvel took her departure joyce telling her that she ought to be ashamed of herself i couldnt help myself retorted marvel and i am sorry to leave her for shes a pleasant young lady to serve well i know id have helped myself was joyces remark i would not go off in this unhandsome way from a good mistress perhaps you wouldnt loftily returned marvel but my inside feelings are delicate and cant bear to be trampled upon the same house is not going to hold me and that tall female image whos more fit to be carried about at a foreign carnival than some that they do carry so marvel left and when lady isabel went to her room to dress for dinner joyce entered it i am not much accustomed to a ladys maids duties began she but miss carlyle has sent me my lady to do what i can for you if you will allow me isabel thought it was kind of miss carlyle and if you please to trust me with the keys of your things i will take charge of them for you my lady until you are suited with a maid joyce resumed i dont know anything about the keys answered isabel i never keep them joyce did her best and lady isabel went down it was nearly six oclock the dinner hour and she strolled to the park gates hoping to meet mr carlyle taking a few steps out she looked down the road but could not see him coming so she turned in again and sat down under a shady tree out of view of the road it was remarkably warm weather for the closing days of may half an hour and then mr carlyle came pelting up passed the gates and turned on to the grass there he saw his wife she had fallen asleep her head leaning against the trunk of a tree her bonnet and parasol lay at her feet her scarf had dropped and she looked like a lovely child her lips partly open her cheeks flushed and her beautiful hair falling around it was an exquisite picture and his heart beat quicker within him as he felt that it was all his own a smile stole to his lips as he stood looking at her she opened her eyes and for a minute could not remember where she was then she started up oh archibald have i been asleep ay and might have been stolen and carried off i could not afford that isabel i dont know how it came about i was listening for you what have you been doing all day he asked as he drew her arm within his and they walked on oh i hardly know she sighed trying the new piano and looking at my watch wishing the time would go quicker that you might come home the ponies and carriage have arrived archibald i know they have my dear have you been out of doors much no i waited for you and then she told him about marvel he felt vexed saying she must replace her with all speed isabel said she knew of one a young woman who had left lady mount severn while she isabel was at castle marling her health was delicate and lady mount severns place too hard for her she might suit write to her said mr carlyle the carriage came rounda beautiful little equipageand isabel was ready as mr carlyle drove slowly down the dusty road they came upon miss corny striding along in the sun with a great umbrella over her head she would not turn to look at them once more as in the year gone by st judes church was in a flutter of expectation it expected to see a whole paraphernalia of bridal finery and again it was doomed to disappointment for isabel had not put off the mourning for her father she was in blacka thin gauze dressand her white bonnet had small black flowers inside and out for the first time in his life mr carlyle took possession of the pew belonging to east lynne filling the place where the poor earl used to sit not so miss cornyshe sat in her own barbara was there with the justice and mrs hare her face wore a gray dusky hue of which she was only too conscious but could not subdue her covetous eyes would wander to that other face with its singular loveliness and its sweetly earnest eyes sheltered under the protection of him for whose sheltering protection she had so long yearned poor barbara did not benefit much by the services that day afterward they went across the churchyard to the </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> the west corner where stood the tomb of lord mount severn isabel looked at the inscription her veil shading her face not here and now my darling he whispered pressing her arm to his side for he felt her silent sobs strive for calmness it seems but the other day he was at church with me and nowhere mr carlyle suddenly changed their places so that they stood with their backs to the hedge and to any staring stragglers who might be lingering on the road there ought to be railings round the tomb she presently said after a successful battle with her emotion i thought so and i suggested it to lord mount severn but he appeared to think differently i will have it done i put you to great expense she said taking one thing with another mr carlyle glanced quickly at her a dim fear penetrating his mind that his sister might have been talking in her hearing an expense i would not be without for the whole world you know it isabel and i have nothing to repay you with she sighed he looked expressively amused and gazing into her face the expression of his eyes made her smile here is john with the carriage she exclaimed let us go archibald standing outside the gates talking to the rectors family were several ladies one of them barbara hare she watched mr carlyle place his wife in the carriage she watched him drive away barbaras lips were white as she bowed in return to his greeting the heat is so great murmured barbara when those around noticed her paleness ah you ought to have gone in the phaeton with mr and mrs hare as they desired you i wished to walk returned the unhappy barbara what a pretty girl that is uttered lady isabel to her husband what is her name barbara hare </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xvii visit of the hare family the county carriages began to pour to east lynne to pay the wedding visit as it is called to mr and lady isabel carlyle of course they displayed themselves in their most courtly state mr carlyle always a popular man had gained double his former importance by his marriage with the daughter of the late earl of mount severn among the earliest visitors went justice and mrs hare with barbara isabel was in her dressinggown attended by joyce whom she was just asking to take the place of her late maid if miss carlyle would consent to the transfer joyces face lighted up with pleasure at the proposal oh my lady you are very kind i should so like it i would serve you faithfully to the best of my ability isabel laughed but miss carlyle may not be inclined to transfer you i think she would be my lady she said a day or two ago that i appeared to suit you and you might have me altogether if you wished provided i could still make her gowns i make them to please her you see my lady do you make her caps also demurely asked lady isabel joyce smiled yes my lady but i am allowed to make them only according to her own pattern joyce if you become my maid you must wear smarter caps yourself i do not wish you to be fine like marvel oh my lady i shall never be fine shuddered joyce and joyce believed she had cause to shudder at finery she was about to speak further when a knock came to the dressingroom door joyce went to open it and saw one of the housemaids a girl who had recently been engaged a native of west lynne isabel heard the colloquy is my lady there yes some visitors pete ordered me to come and tell you i say joyce its the hares and shes with them i watched her get out of the carriage who sharply returned joyce why miss barbara only fancy her coming to pay the wedding visit here my lady had better take care that she dont get a bowl of poison mixed for her masters out or else id have given a shilling to see the interview between the three joyce sent the girl away shut the door and turned to her mistress quite unconscious that the halfwhispered conversation had been audible some visitors are in the drawingroom my lady susan says mr justice hare and mrs hare and miss barbara isabel descended her mind full of the mysterious words spoken by susan the justice was in a new flaxen wig obstinatelooking and pompous mrs hare pale delicate and ladylike barbara beautiful such was the impression they made upon isabel they paid rather a long visit isabel quite falling in love with the gentle and suffering mrs hare and had risen to leave when miss carlyle entered she wished them to remain longerhad something she said to show barbara the justice declined he had a brother justice coming to dine with him at five and it was then halfpast four barbara might stop if she liked barbaras faced turned crimson but nevertheless she accepted the invitation immediately proffered her by miss carlyle to remain at east lynne for the rest of the day dinner time approached and isabel went to dress for it joyce was waiting and entered upon the subject of the service my lady i have spoken to miss carlyle and she is willing that i should be transferred to you but she says i ought first to acquaint you with certain unpleasant facts in my history and the same thought had occurred to me miss carlyle is not over pleasant in manner my lady but she is very upright and just what facts asked lady isabel sitting down to have her hair brushed my lady ill tell you as shortly as it can my father was a clerk in mr carlyles officeof course i mean the late mr carlyle my mother died when i was eight years old and my father afterwards married again a sister of mr kanes wife mr kane the music master yes my lady she and mrs kane were quite ladies had been governesses people said she lowered herself greatly in marrying my father however they did marry and at the end of the year my little sister afy was born we lived in a pretty cottage in the wood and were happy but in twelve months more my stepmother died and an aunt of hers adopted afy i lived with my father going to school then to learn dressmaking and finally going out to work to ladies houses after many years afy came home her aunt had died and her income with her but not the vanity and love of finery that afy had acquired she did nothing but dress herself and read novels my father was angry he said no good could come of it she had several admirers mr richard hare miss barbaras own brother continued joyce lowering her voice and she flirted with them all my father used to go out to shoot on fine evenings after office or to his duties as secretary to the library and so afy was generally all alone until i came home at nine oclock and was free to flirt with her beaux had she any she favored particularly was it thought asked lady isabel the chief one my lady was richard hare she got acquainted with somebody else a stranger who used to ride over from a distance to see her but i fancy there was nothing in itrichard was the one and it went on tilltillhe killed her father who uttered the startled isabel richard hare my lady father had told afy that mr richard should not come there any longer for when gentlemen go in secret after poor girls its well known they have not got marriage in their thoughts father would have interfered more than he did but that he judged well of mr richard and did not think he was one to do afy real harmbut he did not know how flighty she was however one day he heard people talk about it in west lynne coupling her name and mr richards offensively together and at night he told afy before me that it should not go on any longer and she must not encourage him my lady the next night richard hare shot my father how very dreadful whether it was done on purpose or that they had a scuffle and the gun went off accidentally and killed my father no one can tell afy said she had been in the woods at the back of the house and when she came in father lay dead and mr locksley was standing over him he said he had heard the shot and come up just in time to see richard fly from the house his shoes covered with blood he has never been heard of since but there is a judgment of murder out against him and the fear and shame is killing his mother by inches and afy the worst is to come my lady afy followed him directly after the inquest and nothing has been known since of either of them i was taken ill after all these shocks with nervous fever and miss carlyle took care of me and i have remained with her ever since this was what i had to tell you my lady before you decided to take me into service it is not every lady who would like to engage one whose sister has turned out so badly lady isabel did not see that it could make any difference or that it ought to she said so and then leaned back in her chair and mused what dress my lady joyce what was that i heard you and susan gossiping over at the door lady isabel suddenly asked about miss hare giving me a bowl of poison something in the dramatic line that would be you should tell susan not to make her whispers so loud it was only a bit of nonsense my lady these ignorant servants will talk and every one at west lynne knew miss barbara was in love with mr carlyle but i dont fancy she would have been the one to make him happy with all her love a hot flush passed over the brow of lady isabel a sensation very like jealousy flew to her heart no woman likes to hear of anothers being or having been attached to her husband a doubt always arises whether the feeling may not have been reciprocated lady isabel descended she wore a costly black lace dress its low body and sleeves trimmed with as costly white and ornaments of jet she looked inexpressibly beautiful and barbara turned from her with a feeling of sinking jealousy from her beauty from her attire even from the fine soft handkerchief which displayed the badge of her rankthe coronet of an earls daughter barbara looked well too she was in a light blue silk robe and her pretty cheeks were damask with her minds excitement on her neck she wore the gold chain given her by mr carlylestrange that she had not discarded that they stood together at the window looking at mr carlyle as he came up the avenue he saw them and nodded lady isabel watched the damask cheeks turn to crimson at sight of him how do you do barbara he cried as he shook hands come to pay us a visit at last you have been rather tardy over it and how are you my darling he whispered over his wife but she missed his kiss of greeting well would she have had him give it her in public no but she was in the mood to notice the omission dinner over miss carlyle beguiled barbara out of doors barbara would far rather have remained in his presence of course they discussed lady isabel how do you like her abruptly asked barbara alluding to lady isabel better than i thought i should acknowledged miss carlyle i had expected airs and graces and pretence and i must say she is free from them she seems quite wrapped up in archibald and watches for his coming home like a cat </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> cat watches for a mouse she is dull without him barbara compelled her manner to indifference i suppose it is natural i suppose it is absurd was the retort of miss carlyle i give them little of my company especially in an evening they go strolling out together or she sings to him he hanging over her as if she were of gold to judge by appearances she is more precious to him than any gold that was ever coined into money ill tell you what i saw last night archibald had what he is not often subject to a severe headache and he went into the next room after dinner and lay on the sofa she carried a cup of tea to him and never came back leaving her own on the table till it was perfectly cold i pushed open the door to tell her so there was my ladys cambric handkerchief soaked in eaudecologne lying on his forehead and there was my lady herself kneeling down and looking at him he with his arm thrown around her there now i just ask you barbara whether theres any sense in fadding with a man like that if ever he did have a headache before he was married i used to mix him up a good dose of salts and senna and tell him to go to bed early and sleep the pain off barbara made no reply but she turned her face from miss carlyle on barbaras return to the house she found that mr carlyle and lady isabel were in the adjoining room at the piano and barbara had an opportunity of hearing that sweet voice she did as miss carlyle confessed to have done pushed open the door between the two rooms and looked in it was the twilight hour almost too dusk to see but she could distinguish isabel seated at the piano and mr carlyle standing behind her she was singing one of the ballads from the opera of the bohemian girl when other lips why do you like that song so much archibald she asked when she had finished it i dont know i never liked it so much until i heard it from you i wonder if they are come in shall we go into the next room just this one firstthis translation from the german twere vain to tell thee all i feel theres real music in that song yes there is do you know archibald your taste is just like papas he liked all these quiet imaginative songs and so do you and so do i she laughingly added if i must speak the truth she ceased and began the song singing it exquisitely in a low sweet earnest tone the chords of the accompaniment at its conclusion dying off gradually into silence there archibald i am sure i have sung you ten songs at least she said leaning her head back against him and looking at him from her upturned face you ought to pay me he did pay her holding the dear face to him and taking from it some impassioned kisses barbara turned to the window a low moan of pain escaping her as she pressed her forehead on one of its panes and looked forth at the dusky night isabel came in on her husbands arm are you here alone miss hare i really beg your pardon i supposed you were with miss carlyle where is cornelia barbara i have just come in was barbaras reply i dare say she is following me so she was for she entered a moment after her voice raised in anger at the gardener who had disobeyed her orders and obeyed the wishes of lady isabel the evening wore on to ten and as the timepiece struck the hour barbara rose from her chair in amazement i did not think it was so late surely some one must have come for me i will inquire was lady isabels answer and mr carlyle touched the bell no one had come for miss hare then i fear i must trouble peter cried barbara mamma may be gone to rest tired and papa must have forgotten me it would never do for me to get locked out she gaily added as you were one night before said mr carlyle significantly he alluded to the night when barbara was in the grove of trees with her unfortunate brother and mr hare was on the point unconsciously of locking her out she had given mr carlyle the history but its recollection now called up a smart pain and a change passed over her face oh dont archibald she uttered in the impulse of the moment dont recall it isabel wondered can peter take me continued barbara i had better take you said mr carlyle it is late barbaras heart beat at the words beat as she put her things onas she said goodnight to lady isabel and miss carlyle it beat to throbbing as she went out with him and took his arm all just as it used to beonly now that he was the husband of another only it was a warm lovely june night not moonlight but bright with its summer twilight they went down the park into the road which they crossed and soon came to a stile from that stile there led a path through the fields which would pass the back of justice hares barbara stopped at it would you choose the field way tonight barbara the grass will be damp and this is the longest way but we shall escape the dust of the road oh very well if you prefer it it will not make three minutes difference he is very anxious to get home to her mentally exclaimed barbara i shall fly out upon him presently or my heart will burst mr carlyle crossed the stile helped over barbara and then gave her his arm again he had taken her parasol as he had taken it the last night they had walked togetheran elegant little parasol this of blue silk and white lace and he did not switch the hedges with it that night was present to barbara now with all its words and its delusive hopes terribly present to her was their bitter ending there are women of warm impulsive temperaments who can scarcely help in certain moments of highly wrought excitement overstepping the bounds of nature and decorum and giving the reins to temper tongue and imaginationmaking a scene in short barbara had been working herself into this state during the whole evening the affection of isabel for her husband her voice his caressesseen through the half open doorshad maddened her she felt it impossible to restrain her excitement mr carlyle walked on utterly unconscious that a storm was brewing more than that he was unconscious of having given cause for one and dashed into an indifferent common place topic in the most provoking manner when does the justice begin haymaking barbara there was no reply barbara was swelling and panting and trying to keep her emotion down mr carlyle tried again barbara i asked you which day your papa cut his hay still no reply barbara was literally incapable of making one the steam of excitement was on nearly to its highest pitch her throat was working the muscles of her mouth began to twitch and a convulsive sob or what sounded like it broke from her mr carlyle turned his head hastily barbara are you ill what is it on it came passion temper wrongs and nervousness all boiling over together she shrieked she sobbed she was in strong hysterics mr carlyle halfcarried halfdragged her to the second stile and placed her against it his arm supporting her and an old cow and two calves wondering what the disturbance could mean at that sober time of night walked up and stared at them barbara struggled with her emotionstruggled manfullyand the sobs and shrieks subsided not the excitement or the passion she put away his arm and stood with her back to the stile leaning against it mr carlyle felt inclined to fly to the pond for water but he had nothing but his hat to get it in are you better barbara what can have caused it what can have caused it she burst forth giving full swing to the reins and forgetting everything you can ask me that mr carlyle was struck dumb but by some inexplicable laws of sympathy a dim and very unpleasant consciousness of the truth began to steal over him i dont understand you barbara if i have offended you in any way i am truly sorry truly sorry no doubt was the retort the sobs and the shrieks alarmingly near what do you care for me if i go under the sod tomorrow stamping it with her foot you have your wife to care for what am i hush he interposed glancing round more mindful for her than she was for herself hush yes you would like me to hush what is my misery to you i would rather be in my grave archibald carlyle than endure the life i have led since you married her my pain is greater than i well know how to bear i cannot affect to misunderstand you he said feeling more at a nonplus than he had felt for many a day and heartily wishing the whole female creation save isabel somewhere but my dear barbara i never gave you cause to think ithat icared for you more than i did never gave me cause she gasped when you have been coming to our house constantly almost like my shadow when you gave me this dashing open her mantle and holding up the locket to his view when you have been more intimate with me than a brother stay barbara there it isa brother i have been nothing else it never occurred to me to be anything else he added in his straightforward truth ay as a brother nothing else and her voice rose once more with her excitement it seemed that she would not long control it what cared you for my feelings what recked you that you gained my love barbara hush he implored do be calm and reasonable if i ever gave you cause to think i regarded you with deeper feelings i can only express to you my deep regret my repentance and assure you it was done unconsciously she was growing calmer the passion was fading leaving her face still and white she lifted it toward mr carlyle you treated me ill in showing signs of love if you felt it not why did you kiss me i kissed you as i might kiss a sister or perhaps as a pretty girl man likes to do so the close terms on which our families have lived excused if it did not justify a degree of familiarity that might have been unseemly in you need not tell me that hotly interrupted barbara had it been a stranger who had won my love and then thrown me from him do you suppose i would have reproached him as i am now reproaching you no i would have died rather than that he should have suspected it if she had not come between us should you have loved me do not pursue this unthankful topic he besought almost wishing the staring cow would run away with her i ask you should you have loved me persisted barbara passing her handkerchief over her ashy lips i dont know how can i know do i not say to you barbara that i only thought of you as a friend a sister i cannot tell what might have been i could bear it better but that it was known she murmured all west lynne had coupled us together in their prying gossip and they have only pity to cast on me now i would far rather you have killed me archibald i can but express to you my deep regret he repeated i can only hope you will soon forget it all let the remembrance of this conversation pass away with tonight let us still be to each other as friendsas brother and sister believe me he concluded </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> concluded in a deeper tone the confession has not lessened you in my estimation he made a movement as though he would get over the stile but barbara did not stir the tears were silently coursing down her pallid face at that moment there was an interruption is that you miss barbara barbara started as if she had been shot on the other side of the stile stood wilson their upper maid how long might she have been there she began to explain that mr hare had sent jasper out and mrs hare had thought it better to wait no longer for the mans return so had dispatched her wilson for miss barbara mr carlyle got over the stile and handed over miss barbara you need not come any further now she said to him in a low tone i should see you home was his reply and he held out his arm barbara took it they walked in silence arrived at the back gate of the grove which gave entrance to the kitchen garden wilson went forward mr carlyle took both barbaras hands in his goodnight barbara god bless you she had had time for reflection and the excitement gone she saw her outbreak in all its shame and folly mr carlyle noticed how subdued and white she looked i think i have been mad she groaned i must have been mad to say what i did forget that it was uttered i told you i would you will not betray me totoyour wife she panted barbara thank you goodnight but he still retained her hands in a short time barbara i trust you will find one more worthy to receive your love than i have been never she impulsively answered i do not love and forget so lightly in the years to come in my old age i shall still be nothing but barbara hare mr carlyle walked away in a fit of musing the revelation had given him pain and possibly a little bit of flattery into the bargain for he was fond of pretty barbara fond in his waynot hersnot with the sort of fondness he felt for his wife he asked his conscience whether his manner to her in the past days had been a tinge warmer than we bestow upon a sister and he decided that it might have been but he most certainly never cast a suspicion to the mischief it was doing i heartily hope shell soon find somebody to her liking and forget me was his concluding thought as to living and dying barbara hare thats all moonshine and sentimental rubbish that girls like to archibald he was passing the very last tree in the park the nearest to his house and the interruption came from a dark form standing under it is it you my dearest i came out to meet you have you not been very long i think i have he answered as he drew his wife to his side and walked on with her we met one of the servants at the second stile but i went on all the way you have been intimate with the hares quite so cornelia is related to them do you think barbara pretty very thenintimate as you werei wonder you never fell in love with her mr carlyle laughed a very conscious laugh considering the recent interview did you archibald the words were spoken in a low tone almost or he fancied it a tone of emotion and he looked at her in amazement did i what isabel you never loved barbara hare loved her what is your head running on isabel i never loved but one and that one i made my own my cherished wife </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xviii miss carlyleisabel unhappy another year came in isabel would have been altogether happy but for miss carlyle that lady still inflicted her presence upon east lynne and made it the bane of its household she deferred outwardly to lady isabel as the mistress but the real mistress was herself isabel was little more than an automaton her impulses were checked her wishes frustrated her actions tacitly condemned by the imperiouslywilled miss carlyle poor isabel with her refined manners and her timid and sensitive temperament had no chance against the strongminded woman and she was in a state of galling subjection in her own house not a day passed but miss carlyle by dint of hints and innuendoes contrived to impress upon lady isabel the unfortunate blow to his own interests that mr carlyles marriage had been the ruinous expense she had entailed upon the family it struck a complete chill to isabels heart and she became painfully impressed with the incubus she must be to mr carlyleso far as his pocket was concerned lord mount severn with his little son had paid them a short visit at christmas and isabel had asked him apparently with unconcern whether mr carlyle had put himself very much out to the way to marry her whether it had entailed on him an expense and a style of living he would not otherwise have deemed himself justified in affording lord mount severns reply was an unfortunate one his opinion was that it had he said and that isabel ought to feel grateful to him for his generosity she sighed as she listened and from thenceforth determined to put up with miss carlyle more timid and sensitive by nature than many would believe or can imagine reared in seclusion more simply and quietly than falls to the general lot of peers daughters completely inexperienced isabel was unfit to battle with the worldtotally unfit to battle with miss carlyle the penniless state in which she was left at her fathers death the want of a home save that accorded her at castle marling even the hundredpound note left in her hand by mr carlyle all had imbued her with a deep consciousness of humiliation and far from rebelling at or despising the small establishment comparatively speaking provided for her by mr carlyle she felt thankful to him for it but to be told continuously that this was more than he could afford that she was in fact a blight upon his prospects was enough to turn her heart to bitterness oh that she had had the courage to speak out openly to her husband that he might by a single word of earnest love and assurance have taken the weight from her heart and rejoiced it with the truththat all these miserable complaints were but the phantoms of his narrowminded sister but isabel never did when miss corny lapsed into her grumbling mood she would hear in silence or gently bend her aching forehead in her hands never retorting never before mr carlyle was the ladys temper vented upon her plenty fell to his own share when he and his sister were alone and he had become so accustomed to the sort of thing all his lifehad got used to it like the eels do to skinningthat it went as the saying runs in at one ear and out at the other making no impression he never dreamt that isabel also received her portion it was a morning early in april joyce sat in its gray dawn over a large fire in the dressingroom of lady isabel carlyle her hands clasped to pain and the tears coursing down her cheeks joyce was frightened she had had some experience in illness but illness of this nature she had never witnessed and she was fervently hoping never to witness it again in the adjoining room lay lady isabel sick nearly unto death the door from the corridor slowly opened and miss carlyle slowly entered she had probably never walked with so gentle a step in all her life and she had got a thickwadded mantle over her head and ears down she sat in a chair quite meekly and joyce saw that her face looked as gray as the early dawn joyce whispered she is there any danger oh maam i trust not but its hard to witness and it must be awful to bear it is our common curse joyce you and i may congratulate ourselves that we have not chose to encounter it joyce she added after a pause i trust theres no danger i should not like her to die miss carlyle spoke in a low dread tone was she fearing that if her poor young sisterinlaw did die a weight would rest on her own conscience for all timea heavy everpresent weight whispering that she might have rendered her short year of marriage more happy had she chosen and that she had not so chosen but had deliberately steeled every crevice of her heart against her very probably she looked anxious and apprehensive in the mornings twilight if theres any danger joyce why do you think theres danger maam interrupted joyce are other people not as ill as this it is to be hoped they are not rejoined miss carlyle and why is the express gone to lynneborough for dr martin up started joyce awe struck an express for dr martin oh maam who sent it when did it go all i know is thats its gone mr wainwright went to your master and he came out of his room and sent john galloping to the telegraph office at west lynne where could your ears have been not to hear the horse tearing off i heard it i know that and a nice fright it put me in i went to mr carlyles room to ask what was amiss and he said he did not know himselfnothing he hoped and then he shut his door again in my face instead of stopping to speak to me as any other christian would joyce did not answer she was faint with apprehension and there was a silence broken only by the sounds from the next room miss carlyle rose and a fanciful person might have thought she was shivering i cant stand this joyce i shall go if they want coffee or anything of that it can be sent here ask i will presently in a few minutes answered joyce with a real shiver you are not going in are you maam she uttered in apprehension as miss carlyle began to steal on tiptoe to the innerdoor and joyce had a lively consciousness that her sight would not be an agreeable one to lady isabel they want the room free they sent me out not i answered miss corny i could do no good and those who cannot are better away just what mr wainwright said when he dismissed me murmured joyce and miss carlyle finally passed into the corridor and withdrew joyce sat on it seemed to her an interminable time and then she heard the arrival of dr martin heard him go into the next room by and by mr wainwright came out of it into the room where joyce was sitting her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth and before she could bring out the ominous words is there any danger he had passed through it mr wainwright was on his way to the apartment where he expected to find mr carlyle the latter was pacing it he had so paced it all the night his pale face flushed as the surgeon entered you have little mercy on my suspense wainwright dr martin has been here this twenty minutes what does he say well he cannot say any more than i did the symptoms are critical but he hopes she will do well theres nothing for it but patience mr carlyle resumed his weary walk i come now to suggest that you should send for little in these protracted cases the speech was interrupted by a cry from mr carlyle half horror half despair for the rev mr little was the incumbent of st judes and his apprehensions had flownhe hardly knew to what they had flown not for your wife hastily rejoined the surgeonwhat good should a clergyman do to her i spoke on the score of the child should it not live it may be satisfactory to you and lady isabel to know that it was baptized i thank youi thank you said mr carlyle grasping his </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> his hand in his inexpressible relief little shall be sent for you jumped to the conclusion that your wifes soul was flitting please god she may yet live to bear you other children if this one does die please god was the inward aspiration of mr carlyle carlyle added the surgeon in a musing sort of tone as he laid his hand on mr carlyles shoulder which his own head scarcely reached i am sometimes at deathbeds where the clergyman is sent for in this desperate need to the fleeting spirit and i am tempted to ask myself what good another man priest though he be can do at the twelfth hour where accounts have not been made up previously it was hard upon midday the rev mr little mr carlyle and miss carlyle were gathered in the dressingroom round a table on which stood a rich china bowl containing water for the baptism joyce her pale face working with emotion came into the room carrying what looked like a bundle of flannel little cared mr carlyle for the bundle in comparison with his care for his wife joyce he whispered is it well still i believe so sir the services commenced the clergyman took the child what name he asked mr carlyle had never thought about the name but he replied pretty promptly william for he knew it was a name revered and loved by lady isabel the minister dipped his fingers in the water joyce interrupted in much confusion looking at her master it is a little girl sir i beg your pardon im sure i thought i had said so but im so flurried as i never was before there was a pause and then the minister spoke again name the child isabel lucy said mr carlyle upon which a strange sort of resentful sniff was heard from miss corny she had probably thought to hear him mention her own but he had named it after his wife and his mother mr carlyle was not allowed to see his wife until evening his eyelashes glistened as he looked down at her she detected his emotion and a faint smile parted her lips i fear i bore it badly archibald but let us be thankful that it is over how thankful none can know save those who have gone through it i think they can he murmured i never knew what thankfulness was until this day that the baby is safe that you are safe my darling safe and spared to me isabel he whispered hiding his face upon hers i never until today knew what prayer wasthe prayer of a heart in its sore need have you written to lord mount severn she asked after a while this afternoon he replied why did you give baby my nameisabel do you think i could have given it a prettier one i dont why do you not bring a chair and sit down by me he smiled and shook his head i wish i might but they limited my stay with you to four minutes and wainwright has posted himself outside the door with his watch in his hand quite true there stood the careful surgeon and the short interview was over almost as soon as it had begun the baby lived and appeared likely to live and of course the next thing was to look out for a maid for it isabel did not get strong very quickly fever and weakness had a struggle with each other and with her one day when she was dressing and sitting in her easy chair miss carlyle entered of all the servants in the neighborhood who should you suppose is come up after the place of nurse indeed i cannot guess why wilson mrs hares maid three years and five months she has been with them and now leaves in consequence of a fall out with barbara will you see her is she likely to suit is she a good servant shes not a bad servant as servants go responded miss carlyle shes steady and respectable but she has got a tongue as long as from here to lynneborough that wont hurt baby said lady isabel but if she has lived as ladys maid she probably does not understand the care of infants yes she does she was upper servant at squire pinners before going to mrs hares five years she lived there i will see her said lady isabel miss carlyle left the room to send the servant in but came back first alone mind lady isabel dont you engage her if she is likely to suit you let her come again for the answer and meanwhile i will go down to mrs hares and learn the ins and outs of her leaving it is all very plausible for her to put upon barbara but that is only one side of the question before engaging her it may be well to hear the other of course this was but right isabel acquiesced and the servant was introduced a tall pleasant looking woman with black eyes lady isabel inquired why she was leaving mrs hares my lady it is through miss barbaras temper latterlyoh for this year past nothing has pleased her she had grown nearly as imperious as the justice himself i have threatened many times to leave and last evening we came to another outbreak and i left this morning left entirely yes my lady miss barbara provoked me so that i said last night i would leave as soon as breakfast was over and i did so i should be very glad to take your situation my lady if you would please to try me you have been the upper maid at mrs hares oh yes my lady then possibly this situation might not suit you so well as you imagine joyce is the upper servant here and you would in a manner be under her i have great confidence in joyce and in case of my illness or absence joyce would superintend the nursery i should not mind that was the applicants answer we all like joyce my lady a few more questions and then the girl was told to come again in the evening for her answer miss carlyle went to the grove for the ins and outs of the affair where mrs hare frankly stated that she had nothing to urge against wilson save her hasty manner of leaving and believed the chief blame to be due to barbara wilson therefore was engaged and was to enter upon her new service the following morning in the afternoon succeeding to it isabel was lying on the sofa in her bedroom asleep as was supposed in point of fact she was in that state half asleep half wakeful delirium which those who suffer from weakness and fever know only too well suddenly she was aroused from it by hearing her own name mentioned in the adjoining room where sat joyce and wilson the latter holding the sleeping infant on her knee the former sewing the door between the rooms being ajar how ill she does look observed wilson who asked joyce her ladyship she looks just as if shed never get over it she is getting over it quickly now returned joyce if you had seen her but a week ago you would not say she was looking ill now speaking in comparison my goodness would not somebodys hopes be up again if anything should happen nonsense crossly rejoined joyce you may cry out nonsense forever joyce but they would went on wilson and she would snap him up to a dead certainty shed never let him escape her a second time she is as much in love with him as she ever was it was all talk and fancy said joyce west lynne must be busy mr carlyle never cared for her thats more than you know i have seen a little joyce i have seen him kiss her a pack of rubbish remarked joyce that tells nothing i dont say it does theres not a young man living but whats fond of a sly kiss in the dark if he can get it he gave her that locket and chain she wears who wears retorted joyce determined not graciously to countenance the subject i dont want to hear anything about it who now why miss barbara she has hardly had it off her neck since my belief is she wears it in her sleep more simpleton she returned joyce the night before he left west lynne to marry lady isabeland didnt the news come upon us like a thunderclap miss barbara had been at miss carlyles and he brought her home a lovely night it was the moon rising and nearly as light as day he somehow broke her parasol in coming home and when they got to our gate there was a love scene were you a third in it sarcastically demanded joyce yes without meaning to be it was a regular love scene i could hear enough for that if ever anybody thought to be mrs carlyle barbara did that night why you great baby you have just said it was the night before he went to get married i dont care she did after he was gone i saw her lift up her hands and her face in ecstacy and say he would never know how much she loved him until she was his wife be you very sure joyce many a lovepassage had passed between them two but i suppose when my lady was thrown in his way he couldnt resist her rank and her beauty and the old love was cast over it is in the nature of man to be fickle specially those that can boast of their own good looks like mr carlyle mr carlyles not fickle i can tell you more yet two or three days after that miss corny came up to our house with the news of his marriage i was in mistresss bedroom and they were in the room underneath the windows open and i heard miss corny tell the tale for i was leaning out up came miss barbara upon an excuse and flew into her room and i went into the corridor a few moments and i heard a noise it was a sort of wail or groanand i opened the door softly fearing she might be fainting joyce if my heart never ached for anybody before it ached then she was lying upon the floor her hands writhed together and her poor face all white like one in mortal agony id have given a quarters wages to be able to say a word of comfort to her but i didnt dare interfere with such sorrow as that i came out again and shut the door without her seeing me how thoroughly stupid she must have been uttered joyce to go caring for one who did not care for her i tell you joyce you dont know that he did not care you are as obstinate as the justice and i wish to goodness you wouldnt interrupt me they came up here to pay the wedding visit master mistress and she came in state in the grand chariot with the coachman and jasper if you have got any memory at all you cant fail to recollect it miss barbara remained behind at east lynne to spend the rest of the day i remember it i was sent to fetch her home in the evening jasper being out i came the field way for the dust by the road was enough to smother one and by the last stile but one what do you think i came upon joyce lifted her eyes a snake perhaps i came upon miss barbara and mr carlyle what had passed nobody knows but themselves she was leaning back against the stile crying low soft sobs breaking from her like one might expect to hear from a breaking heart it seemed as if she had been reproaching him as if some explanation had passed and i heard him say that from henceforth they could only be brother and sister i spoke soon for fear they should see me and mr carlyle got over the stile miss barbara said to </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> to him that he need not come any further but he held out his arm and came with her to our back gate i went on then to open the door and i saw him with his head bent down to her and her two hands held in his we dont know how it is between them i tell you at any rate she is a downright fool to suffer herself to love him still uttered joyce indignantly so she is but she does do it shell often steal out to the gate about the time she knows hell be passing and watch him by not letting him see her it is nothing but her unhappiness her jealousy of lady isabel that makes her cross i assure you joyce in this past year she had so changed that shes not like the same person if mr carlyle should ever get tired of my lady and wilson harshly interrupted joyce have the goodness to recollect yourself what have i said not nothing but truth men are shamefully fickle husbands worse than sweethearts and im sure im not thinking of anything wrong but to go back to the argument that we began withi say that if anything happened to my lady miss barbara as sure as fate would step into her shoes nothing is going to happen to her continued joyce with composure i hope it is not now or laterfor the sake of this dear little innocent thing upon my lap went on the undaunted wilson she would not make a very kind stepmother for it is certain that where the first wife had been hated her children wont be loved she would turn mr carlyle against them i tell you what it is wilson interrupted joyce in a firm unmistakable tone if you think to pursue those sort of topics at east lynne i shall inform my lady that you are unsuitable for the situation i dare say and you know that when i make up my mind to a thing i do it continued joyce miss carlyle may well say you have the longest tongue in west lynne but you might have the grace to know that this subject is one more unsuitable to it than another whether you are eating mr hares bread or whether you are eating mr carlyles another word wilson it appears to me that you have been carrying on a prying system in mrs hares housedo not attempt such a thing in this you were always one of the straightlaced sort joyce cried wilson laughing goodhumoredly but now that i have had my say out i shall stop and you need not fear i shall be such a simpleton as to go prattling of this kind of thing to the servants now just fancy this conversation penetrating to lady isabel she heard every word it is all very well to oppose the argument who attends to the gossip of the servants let me tell you it depends upon what the subject may be whether the gossip is attended to or not it might not and indeed would not have made so great an impression upon her had she been in strong health but she was weak feverish and in a state of partial delirium and she hastily took up the idea that archibald carlyle had never loved her that he had admired her and made her his wife in his ambition but that his heart had been given to barbara hare a pretty state of excitement she worked herself into as she lay there jealousy and fever ay and love too playing pranks with her brain it was near the dinner hour and when mr carlyle entered he was startled to see her her pallid cheeks were burning with a red hectic glow and her eyes glistened with fever isabel you are worse he uttered as he approached her with a quick step she partially rose from the sofa and clasped hold of him in her emotion oh archibald archibald she uttered dont marry her i could not rest in my grave mr carlyle in his puzzled astonishment believed her to be laboring under some temporary hallucination the result of weakness he set himself to soothe her but it seemed that she could not be soothed she burst into a storm of tears and began againwild words she would illtreat my child she would draw your love from it and from my memory archibald you must not marry her you must be speaking from the influence of a dream isabel he soothingly said you have been asleep and are not yet awake be still and recollection will return to you there love rest upon me to think of her as your wife brings pain enough to kill me she continued to reiterate promise me that you will not marry her archibald promise it i will promise you anything in reason he replied bewildered with her words but i do not know what you mean there is no possibility of my marrying any one isabel you are my wife but if i die i mayyou know i may and many think i shalldo not let her usurp my place indeed she shall notwhoever you may be talking of what have you been dreaming who is it that has been troubling your mind archibald do you need to ask did you love no one before you married me perhaps you have loved her sinceperhaps you love her still mr carlyle began to discern method in her madness he changed his cheering tone to one of grave earnestness of whom to you speak isabel of barbara hare he knitted his brow he was both annoyed and vexed whatever had put this bygone nonsense into his wifes head he quitted the sofa where he had been supporting her and stood upright before her calm dignified almost solemn in his seriousness isabel what notion can you possibly have picked up about myself and barbara hare i never entertained the faintest shadow of love for her either before my marriage or since you must tell me what has given rise to this idea in your mind but she loved you a moments hesitation for of course mr carlyle was conscious that she had but taking all the circumstances into consideration more especially how he learnt the fact he could not in honor acknowledge it to his wife if it was so isabel she was more reprehensibly foolish than i should have given barbaras good sense could be for a woman may almost as well lose herself as to suffer herself to love unsought if she did give her love to me i can only say i was entirely unconscious of it believe me you have as much cause to be jealous of cornelia as you have of barbara hare an impulse rose within her that she would tell him all the few words dropped by susan and joyce twelve months before the conversation she had just overheard but in that moment of renewed confidence it did appear to her that she must have been very foolish to attach importance to itthat a sort of humiliation in listening to the converse of servants was reflected on her and she remained silent there never was a passion in this worldthere never will be oneso fantastic so delusive so powerful as jealousy mr carlyle dismissed the episode from his thoughts he believed his wifes emotion to have been simply from a feverish dream and never supposed but that with the dream its recollection would pass away from her not so implicitly relying upon her husbands words at the moment feeling quite ashamed at her own suspicion lady isabel afterward suffered the unhappy fear to regain its influence the illstarred revelations of wilson reasserted their power overmastering the denial of mr carlyle shakspeare calls jealousy yellow and green i think it may be called black and white for it most assuredly views white as black and black as white the most fanciful surmises wear the aspect of truth the greatest improbabilities appear as consistent realities not another word said isabel to her husband and the feelingyou will understand this if you have ever been foolish enough to sun yourself in its delightsonly caused her to grow more attached to him to be more eager for his love but certain it is that barbara hare dwelt on her heart like an incubus </chapter>
<chapter>chapter xix captain thorn at west lynne barbara how fine the day seems it is a beautiful day mamma i do think i should be all the better for going out i am sure you would mamma was barbaras answer if you went out more you would find the benefit every fine day you ought to do so i will go and ask papa if he can spare benjamin and the carriage she waltzed gaily out of the room but returned in a moment mamma it is all right benjamin is gone to get the carriage ready you would like a bit of luncheon before you goi will order the tray anything you please dear said the sweettempered gentlewoman i dont know why but i feel glad to go out today perhaps because it is lovely benjamin made ready his carriage and himself and drove out of the yard at the back and brought the carriage round to the front gate the carriageor phaeton as it was often calledwas a somewhat old fashioned concern as many country things are apt to be a small box in front for the driver and a wide seat with a head behind accommodating barbara well between them when mr and mrs hare both sat in benjamin drew the rug carefully over his mistresss kneesthe servants did not like mr hare but would have laid down their lives for herascended to his box and drove them to their destination the linen drapers it was an excellent shop situated a little beyond the office of mr carlyle and mrs hare and barbara were soon engaged in that occupation said to possess for all women a fascination they had been in about an hour when mrs hare discovered that her bag was missing i must have left it in the carriage barbara go and bring it will you my dear the pattern of that silk is in it barbara went out the carriage and benjamin and the sleek old horse were all waiting drowsily together barbara could not see the bag and she appealed to the servant find mammas bag benjamin it must be somewhere in the carriage benjamin got off his box and began to search barbara waited gazing listlessly down the street the sun was shining brilliantly and its rays fell upon the large cable chain of a gentleman who was sauntering idly up the pavement making its gold links and its drooping seal and key glitter as they crossed his waistcoat it shone also upon the enameled gold studs of his shirt front making them glitter and as he suddenly raised his ungloved hand to stroke his moustacheby which action you know a vain mana diamond ring he wore gleamed with a light that was positively dazzling involuntarily barbara thought of the description her brother richard had given of certain dazzling jewels worn by another she watched him advance he was a handsome man of perhaps seven or eight and twenty tall slender and well made his eyes and hair black a very pleasant expression sat upon his countenance and on the left hand he wore a light buff kid glove and was swinging its fellow by the fingers but for the light cast at that moment by the sun barbara might not have noticed the jewellery or connected it in her mind with the other jewellery in that unhappy secret hallo thorn is that you just step over here the speaker was otway bethel who was on the opposite side of the street the spoken to the gentleman with the jewellery but the latter was in a brown study and did not hear bethel called out again louder captain thorn that was heard captain thorn nodded and turned short off across the street barbara stood like one in a dream her brain her mind her fancy all in a confused mass together </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> together heres the bag miss barbara it had got among the folds of the rug benjamin held it out to her but she took no notice she was unconscious of all external things save one that she beheld the real murderer of hallijohn she entertained no manner of doubt in every particular he tallied with the description given by richard tall dark vain handsome delicate hands jewellery andcaptain thorn barbaras cheeks grew white and her heart turned sick the bag miss barbara away tore barbara leaving benjamin and the bag in wonder she had caught sight of mr wainwright the surgeon at a little distance and sped toward him mr wainwright began she forgetting ceremony in her agitation you see that gentleman talking to otway bethelwho is he mr wainwright had to put his glasses across the bridge of his nose before he could answer for he was shortsighted that oh it is a captain thorn he is visiting the herberts i believe where does he come from where does he live reiterated barbara in her eagerness i dont know anything about him i saw him this morning with young smith and he told me he was a friend of the herberts you are not looking well miss barbara she made no answer captain thorn and mr bethel came walking down the street and the latter saluted her but she was too much confused to respond to it mr wainwright then wished her good day and barbara walked slowly back mrs hare was appearing at the shop door my dear how long you are cannot the bag be found i went to speak to mr wainwright answered barbara mechanically taking the bag from benjamin and giving it to her mother her whole heart and eyes still absorbed with that one object moving away in the distance you look pale child are you well oh yes quite let us get our shopping over mamma she moved on to their places at the counter as she spoke eager to get it over and be at home that she might have time for thought mrs hare wondered what had come to her the pleased interest displayed in their purchases previously was now gone and she sat inattentive and absorbed now my dear it is only waiting for you to choose which of the two silks will you have eitherany take which you like mamma barbara what has come to you i believe i am tired said barbara with a forced laugh as she compelled herself to pay some sort of attention i dont like the green i will take the other they arrived at home barbara got just five minutes alone in her chamber before the dinner was on the table all the conclusion she could come to was she could do nothing save tell the facts to archibald carlyle how could she contrive to see him the business might admit of no delay she supposed she must go to east lynne that evening but where would be her excuse for it at home puzzling over it she went down to dinner during the meal mrs hare began talking of some silk she had purchased for a mantle she should have it made like miss carlyles new one when miss carlyle was at the grove the other day about wilsons character she offered her the pattern and she mrs hare would send one of the servants up for it after dinner oh mamma let me go burst forth barbara and so vehemently spoke she that the justice paused in carving and demanded what ailed her barbara made some timid excuse her eagerness is natural richard smiled mrs hare barbara thinks she shall get a peep at the baby i expect all young folks are fond of babies barbaras face flushed crimson but she did not contradict the opinion she could not eat her dinnershe was too full of poor richard she played with it and then sent away her plate nearly untouched thats through the finery shes been buying pronounced justice hare her head is stuffed up with it no opposition was offered to barbaras going to east lynne she reached it just as their dinner was over it was for miss carlyle she asked miss carlyle is not at home miss she is spending the day out and my lady does not receive visitors yet it was a sort of checkmate barbara was compelled to say she would see mr carlyle peter ushered her into the drawingroom and mr carlyle came to her i am so very sorry to disturb youto have asked for you began barbara with a burning face for somehow a certain evening interview of hers with him twelve months before was disagreeably present to her never since that evening of agitation had barbara suffered herself to betray emotion to mr carlyle her manner to him had been calm courteous and indifferent and she now more frequently called him mr carlyle than archibald take a seattake a seat barbara i asked for miss carlyle she continued for mamma is in want of a pattern that she promised to lend her you remember the lieutenant thorn whom richard spoke of as being the real criminal yes i think he is at west lynne mr carlyle was aroused to eager interest he the same thorn it can be no other mamma and i were shopping today and i went out for her bag which she left in the carriage while benjamin was getting it i saw a stranger coming up the streeta tall goodlooking darkhaired man with a conspicuous gold chain and studs the sun was full upon him causing the ornaments to shine especially a diamond ring which he wore for he had one hand raised to his face the thought flashed over me that is just like the description richard gave of the man thorn why the idea should have occurred to me in that strange manner i do not know but it most assuredly did occur though i did not really suppose him to be the same just then i heard him spoken to by some one on the other side of the street it was otway bethel and he called him captain thorn this is curious indeed barbara i did not know any stranger was at west lynne i saw mr wainwright and asked him who it was he said a captain thorn a friend of the herberts a lieutenant thorn four or five years ago would probably be captain thorn now mr carlyle nodded and there was a pause what can be done asked barbara mr carlyle was passing one hand over his brow it was a habit of his when in deep thought it is hard to say what is to be done barbara the description you gave of this man certainly tallies with that given by richard did he look like a gentleman very much so a remarkably aristocratic looking man as it struck me mr carlyle again nodded assentingly he remembered richards words when describing the other an outandout aristocrat of course barbara the first thing must be to try and ascertain whether it is the same he observed if we find it is then we must deliberate upon future measures i will see what i can pick up and let you know barbara rose mr carlyle escorted her across the hall and then strolled down the park by her side deep in the subject and quite unconscious that lady isabels jealous eyes were watching them from her dressingroom window you say he seemed intimate with otway bethel as to being intimate i cannot say otway bethel spoke as though he knew him this must have caused excitement to mrs hare you forget archibald that mamma was not told anything about thorn was the answer of barbara the uncertainty would have worried her to death all richard said to her was that he was innocent that it was a stranger who did the deed and she asked for no particulars she had implicit faith in richards truth true i did forget replied mr carlyle i wish we could find out some one who knew the other thorn to ascertain that they were the same would be a great point gained he went as far as the park gates with barbara shook hands and wished her good evening scarcely had she departed when mr carlyle saw two gentlemen advancing from the opposite direction in one of whom he recognized tom herbert and the otherinstinct told himwas captain thorn he waited till they came up if this isnt lucky seeing you cried mr tom herbert who was a freeandeasy sort of a gentleman the second son of a brother justice of mr hare i wish to goodness youd give us a draught of your cider carlyle we went up to beauchamps for a stroll but found them all out and im awful thirsty captain thorn carlyle mr carlyle invited them to his house and ordered in refreshments young herbert coolly threw himself into an armchair and lit a cigar come thorn cried he heres a weed for you captain thorn glanced toward mr carlyle he appeared of a far more gentlemanly nature than tom herbert youll have one too carlyle said herbert holding out his cigarcase oh i forgotyou are a muff dont smoke one twice a year i say hows lady isabel very ill still by jove is she though tell her i am sorry to hear it will you carlyle buti say will she smell the smoke asked he with a mixture of alarm and concern in his face mr carlyle reassured him upon the point and turned to captain thorn are you acquainted with this neighborhood captain thorn smiled i only reached west lynne yesterday you were never here before then continued mr carlyle setting down the last as a probably evasive answer no he and my brother jack you know are in the same regiment put in tom with scanty ceremony jack had invited him down for some fishing and that and thorn arrives but he never sent word he was coming you see jack had given him up and is off on some irish expedition the deuce knows where precious unlucky that it should have happened so thorn says he shall cut short his stay and go again the conversation turned upon fishing and in the heat of the argument the stranger mentioned a certain pond and its famous eelsthe low pond mr carlyle looked at him speaking however in a careless manner which do you mean we have two ponds not far apart each called the low pond i mean the one on an estate about three miles form heresquire thorpes unless i am mistaken mr carlyle smiled i think you must have been in the neighborhood before captain thorn squire thorpe is dead and the property has passed to his daughters husband and that low pond was filled up three years ago i have heard a friend mention it was captain thorns reply spoken in an indifferent tone though he evidently wished not to pursue the subject mr carlyle by easy degrees turned the conversation upon swainson the place where richard hares captain thorn was suspected to have come the present captain thorn said he knew it a little he had once been staying there a short time mr carlyle became nearly convinced that barbaras suspicions were correct the description certainly agreed so far as he could judge in the most minute particulars the man before him wore two rings a diamondand a very beautiful diamond tooon the one hand a seal ring on the other his hands were delicate to a degree and his handkerchief a cambric one of unusually fine texture was not entirely guiltless of scent mr carlyle quitted the room for a moment and summoned joyce to him my lady has been asking for you said joyce tell her i will be up the moment these gentlemen leave joyce he added find an excuse to come into the room presently you can bring something or other in i want you to look at this stranger who is with young mr herbert notice him well i fancy you may have seen him before mr carlyle returned to the room leaving joyce </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> joyce surprised however she presently followed taking in some water and lingered a few minutes apparently placing the things on the table in better order when the two departed mr carlyle called joyce before proceeding to his wifes room well he questioned did you recognize him not at all sir he seemed quite strange to me cast your thoughts back joyce did you never see him in days gone by joyce looked puzzled and she replied in the negative is he the man think you who used to ride from swainson to see afy joyces face flushed crimson oh sir was all she uttered the name is the samethorn i thought it possible the men might be observed mr carlyle sir i cannot say i never saw that captain thorn but once and i dont know i dont know joyce spoke slowly and with considerationthat i should at all know him again i did not think of him when i looked at this gentleman but at any rate no appearance in this one struck upon my memory as being familiar so from joyce mr carlyle obtained no clue one way or the other the following day he sought out otway bethel are you intimate with that captain thorn who is staying with the herberts asked he yes answered bethel decisively if passing a couple of hours in his company can constitute intimacy thats all i have seen of thorn are you sure pursued mr carlyle sure returned bethel why what are you driving at now i called in at herberts the night before last and tom asked me to stay the evening thorn had just come a jolly bout we had cigars and cold punch bethel said mr carlyle dashing to the point is it the thorn who used to go after afy hallijohn come you can tell if you like bethel remained dumb for a moment apparently with amazement what a confounded lie uttered he at length why its no more that thanwhat thorn he broke off abruptly you are equivocating bethel the thorn who is mixed upor said to bein the hallijohn affair is this the same man you are a fool carlyle which is what i never took you to be yet was mr bethels rejoinder spoken in a savage tone i have told you that i never knew there was any thorn mixed up with afy and i should like to know why my word is not to be believed i never saw thorn in my life till i saw him the other night at the herberts and that i would take my oath to if put to it bethel quitted mr carlyle with the last word and the latter gazed after him revolving points in his brain the mention of thorns name the one spoken of by richard hare appeared to excite some feeling in bethels mind arousing it to irritation mr carlyle remembered that it had done so previously and now it had done so again and yet bethel was an easynatured man in general far better tempered than principled that there was something hidden some mystery connected with the affair mr carlyle felt sure but he could not attempt so much as a guess at what it might be and this interview with bethel brought him no nearer the point he wished to find outwhether this thorn was the same man in walking back to his office he met mr tom herbert does captain thorn purpose making a long stay with you he stopped him to inquire hes gone i have just seen him off by the train was the reply of tom herbert it seemed rather slow with him without jack so he docked his visit and says hell pay us one when jacks to the fore as mr carlyle went home to dinner that evening he entered the grove ostensibly to make a short call on mrs hare barbara on the tenterhooks of impatience accompanied him outside when he departed and walked down the path what have you learnt she eagerly asked nothing satisfactory was the reply of mr carlyle and the man has left again left uttered barbara mr carlyle explained he told her how they had come to his house the previous evening after barbaras departure and his encounter with tom herbert that day he mentioned also his interview with bethel can he have gone on purpose fearing consequences wondered barbara scarcely or why should he have come you did not suffer any word to escape you last night causing him to suspect for a moment that he was hounded not any you would make a bad lawyer barbara who or what is he an officer in her majestys service in john herberts regiment i ascertained no more tom said he was of good family but i cannot help suspecting it is the same man can nothing more be done nothing in the present stage of the affair continued mr carlyle as he passed through the gate to continue his way we can only wait on again with what patience we may hoping that time will bring about its own elucidation barbara pressed her forehead down on the cold iron of the gate as his footsteps died away aye to wait on she murmured to wait on in dreary pain to wait on perhaps for years perhaps forever and poor richardwearing out his days in poverty and exile </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xx going from home i should recommend a complete change of scene altogether mr carlyle say some place on the french or belgian coast sea bathing might do wonders should you think it well for her to go so far from home i should in these cases of protracted weakness where you can do nothing but try to coax the strength back again change of air and scene are of immense benefit i will propose it to her said mr carlyle i have just done so replied dr martin who was the other speaker she met it with objection which i expected for invalids naturally feel a disinclination to move from home but it is necessary that she should go the object of their conversation was lady isabel years had gone on and there were three children now at east lynneisabel william and archibaldthe latter twelve months old lady isabel had a month or two back been attacked with illness she recovered from the disorder but it had left her in an alarming state of weakness she seemed to get worse instead of better and dr martin was summoned from lynneborough the best thing he could recommendas you save seenwas change of air lady isabel was unwilling to take the advice more especially to go so far as the french coast and but for a circumstance that seemed to have happened purposely to induce her to decide would probably never have gone mrs duciethe reader may not have forgotten her namehad in conjunction with her husband the honorable augustus somewhat run out at the elbows and found it convenient to enter for a time on the less expensive life of the continent for eighteen months she had been staying in paris the education of her younger daughters being the plea put forth and a very convenient plea it is and serves hundreds isabel had two or three letters from her during her absence and she now received another saying they were going to spend a month or two at boulognesurmer mr carlyle mr wainwright and dr martinin short everybodydeclared this must remove all lady isabels unwillingness to go from home for mrs ducies society would do away with the loneliness she had anticipated which had been the ostensible score of her objection boulognesurmer of all places in the world remonstrated lady isabel it is spoken of as being crowded and vulgar the more amusing for you my lady cried dr martin while mr carlyle laughed at her and finding she had no chance against them all she consented to go and plans were hastily decided upon joyce said lady isabel to her waiting maid i shall leave you at home i must take wilson instead oh my lady what have i done you have done all that you ought joyce but you must stay with the children if i may not take them the next best thing will be to leave them in your charge not miss carlyles she said shaking her voice if it were wilson who remained i could not do that my lady i must do whatever you think best i wish i could attend you and stay with them but of course i cannot do both i am sent away to get health and strength but it may be that i shall die joyce if i never come back will you promise to remain with my children joyce felt a creeping sensation in her veins the sobs rose in her throat but she swallowed them down and constrained her voice to calmness my lady i hope you will come back to us as well as you used to be i trust you will hope so too my lady and not give way to low spirits i sincerely hope and trust i shall answered lady isabel fervently still theres no telling for i am very ill joyce give me your promise in case of the worst you will remain with the children i will my ladyas long as i am permitted and be kind to them and love them and shield them fromfromany unkindness that may be put upon them she added her head full of miss carlyle and talk to them sometimes of their poor mother who is gone i will i willoh my lady i will and joyce sat down in the rockingchair as lady isabel quitted her and burst into tears mr carlyle and lady isabel with wilson and peter in attendance arrived at boulogne and proceeded to the hotel des bains it may be as well to mention that peter had been transferred from miss carlyles service to theirs when the establishment was first formed at east lynne upon entering the hotel they inquired for mrs ducie and then a disappointment awaited them a letter was handed them which had arrived that morning from mrs ducie expressing her regret that certain family arrangements prevented her visiting boulogne she was proceeding to some of the baths in germany instead i might almost have known it remarked isabel she was always the most changeable of women mr carlyle went out in search of lodgings isabel objecting to remain in the bustling hotel he succeeded in finding some very desirable ones situated in the rue de lecu near the port and they moved into them he thought the journey had done her good for she looked better and said she already felt stronger mr carlyle remained with her three days he had promised only one but he was pleased with everything around him pleased with isabels returning glimpses of health and amused with the scenes of the busy town the tide served at eight oclock the following morning and mr carlyle left by the folkestone boat wilson made his breakfast and after swallowing it in haste he returned to his wifes room to say farewell goodbye my love he said stooping to kiss her take care of yourself give my dear love to the darlings archibald andand and what he asked i have not a moment to lose do not get making love to barbara hare while i am away she spoke in a tone half jest half seriouscould he but have seen how her heart was breaking mr carlyle took it wholly as a jest and went away laughing had he believed she was serious he could have been little more surprised had she charged him not to go about the country on a dromedary isabel rose later and lingered over her breakfast listless enough she was wondering how she would make the next few weeks pass what she should do with her time she had taken two sea baths since her arrival but they had appeared not to agree with her leaving her low and shivering afterwards so it was not deemed advisable that she should attempt more it was a lovely morning and she determined to venture on to </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> to the pier to where they had sat on the previous evening she had not mr carlyles arm but it was not far and she could take a good rest at the end of it she went attended by peter took her seat and told him to come for her in an hour she watched the strollers on the pier as they had done the previous evening not in crowds now but stragglers coming on at intervals there came a gouty man in a list shoe there came three young ladies and their governess there came two fast puppies in shooting jackets and eyeglasses which they turned with a broad stare on lady isabel but there was something about her which caused them to drop their glasses and their ill manners together after an interval there appeared another a tall handsome gentlemanly man her eyes fell upon him andwhat was it that caused every nerve in her frame to vibrate every pulse to quicken whose form was it that was thus advancing and changing the monotony of her mind into tumult it was that of one whom she was soon to find had never been entirely forgotten captain levison came slowly on approaching the pier where she sat he glanced at her not with the hardihood displayed by the two young men but with quite sufficiently evident admiration what a lovely girl thought he to himself who can she be sitting there alone all at once a recollection flashed into his mind he raised his hat and extended his hand his fascinating smile in full play i certainly cannot be mistaken have i the honor of once more meeting lady isabel vane she rose from the seat and allowed him to take her hand answering a few words at random for her wits seemed woolgathering i beg your pardoni should have said lady isabel carlyle time has elapsed since we parted and in the pleasure of seeing you again so unexpectedly i thought of you as you were then she sat down again the brilliant flush of emotion dying away upon her cheeks it was the loveliest face francis levison had seen since he saw hers and he thought so as he gazed at it what can have brought you to this place he inquired taking a seat beside her i have been ill she explained and am ordered to the seaside we should not have come here but for mrs ducie we expected to meet her mr carlyle only left me this morning mrs ducie is off to ems i see them occasionally they have been fixtures in paris for some time you do indeed look ill he abruptly added in a tone of sympathy alarmingly ill is there anything i can do for you she was aware that she looked unusually ill at that moment for the agitation and surprise of meeting him were fading away leaving her face an ashy whiteness exceedingly vexed and angry with herself did she feel that the meeting should have power to call forth emotion until that moment she was unconscious that she retained any sort of feeling for captain levison perhaps i have ventured out too early she said in a tone that would seem to apologize for her looks i think i will return i shall meet my servant no doubt goodmorning captain levison but indeed you do not appear fit to walk alone he remonstrated you must allow me to see you safely home drawing her hand within his own quite as a matter of course as he had done many a time in days gone by he proceeded to assist her down the pier lady isabel conscious of her own feelings felt that it was not quite the thing to walk thus familiarly with him but he was a sort of relation of the familya connection at any rateand she could find no ready excuse for declining have you seen lady mount severn lately he inquired i saw her when i was in london this spring with mr carlyle the first time we have met since my marriage and we do not correspond lord mount severn had paid us two or three visits at east lynne they are in town yet i believe for all i know i have not seen them or england either for ten months i have been staying in paris and got here yesterday a long leave of absence she observed oh i have left the army i sold out the truth is lady isabelfor i dont mind telling youthings are rather down with me at present my old uncle has behaved shamefully he has married again i heard that sir peter had married he is seventythreethe old simpleton of course this materially alters my prospects for it is just possible he may have a son of his own now and my creditors all came down upon me they allowed me to run into debt with complacency when i was heir to the title and estates but as soon as sir peters marriage appeared in the papers myself and my consequence dropped a hundred per cent credit was stopped and i dunned for payment so i thought id cut it altogether and i sold out and came abroad leaving your creditors what else could i do my uncle would not pay them or increase my allowance what are your prospects then resumed lady isabel prospects do you see that little ragged boy throwing stones into the harborit is well the police dont drop upon himask him what his prospects are and he will stare you in the face and say none mine are on a like par you may succeed sir peter yet i may but i may not when those old idiots get a young wife have you quarreled with sir peter interrupted lady isabel i should quarrel with him as he deserves if it would do any good but i might get my allowance stopped self interest you see lady isabel is the order of the day with most of us do you propose staying in boulogne long i dont know as i may find amusement paris is a fast capital with its heated rooms and its late hours and i came down for the refreshment of a few sea dips am i walking too fast for you you increased your pace alarmingly when you spoke of sir peters marriage and i am not sorry for it she added goodnaturedly for it has proved to me how strong i am getting a week ago i could not have walked half so fast he interrupted with eager apologies and soon they reached her home captain levison entered with heruninvited he probably deemed between connections great ceremonies might be dispensed with and he sat a quarter of an hour chatting to amuse her when he rose he inquired what she meant to do with herself in the afternoon to lie down replied isabel i am not strong enough to sit up all day should you be going out afterwards you must allow me to take care of you he observed i am glad that i happened to be here for i am sure you are not fit to wander out without an arm and only followed by a servant when mr carlyle comes he will thank me for my pains what was she to urge in objection simply nothing he spoke let us not doubt from a genuine wish to serve her in a plain easy tone as any acquaintance might speak lady isabel schooled herself severely if those old feelings were not quite dead within her why she must smother them down again as effectually as if they were the very fact of recognizing such to her own heart brought a glow of shame to her brow she would meet captain levison and suffer his companionship as she would that of the most indifferent stranger it was just the wrong way for her to go to work though as the days passed on lady isabel improved wonderfully she was soon able to go to the sands in the morning and sit there to enjoy the sea air watching the waves come up to recede with the tide she made no acquaintance whatever in the place and when she had a companion it was captain levison he would frequently join her there sometimes take her almost always give her his arm home of all things she disliked the having to take his arm would a thousand times over rather have taken good old peters a secret prick of the conscience whispered it might be better if she did not one day she said in a joking sort of mannershe would not say it in any otherthat now she was strong she had no need of his arm and his escort he demanded in evident astonishment what had arisen that he might not still afford it seeing her husband was not with her to give her his she had no answer in reply to this no excuse to urge and in default of one took his arm as usual in the evening he would be ready to take her to the pier but they sat apart mixing not with the bustling crowdhe lending to his manner as he conversed with her all that he would call up of fascinationand fascination such as francis levisons might be dangerous to any ear in the sweet evening twilight the walk over he left her at her own door she never asked him in in the evening and he did not intrude without as he sometimes would of a morning now where was the help for this you may say that she should have remained indoors and not have subjected herself to his companionship but the remaining indoors would not have brought her health and it was health that she was staying in boulogne to acquire and the sooner it came the better pleased she would be for she wanted to be at home with her husband and children in a fortnight from the period of his departure mr carlyle was expected in boulogne but what a marvellous change had this fortnight wrought in lady isabel she did not dare to analyze her feelings but she was conscious that all the fresh emotions of her youth had come again the blue sky seemed as of the sweetest sapphire the green fields and waving trees were of an emerald brightness the perfume of the flowers was more fragrant than any perfume had yet seemed she knew that the sky that the grassy plains the leafy trees the brilliant flowers were but as they ever had been she knew that the sunny atmosphere possessed no more of loveliness or power of imparting delight than of old and she knew that the change the sensation of ecstacy was in her own heart no wonder that she shrank from selfexamination the change from listless languor to her present feeling brought the hue and contour of health to her face far sooner than anything else could have done she went down with captain levison to meet mr carlyle the evening he came in and when mr carlyle saw her behind the cords as he was going to the customhouse he scarcely knew her her features had lost their sharpness her cheeks wore a rosy flush and the light of pleasure at meeting him again shone in her eyes what can you have been doing to yourself my darling he uttered in delight as he emerged from the customhouse and took her hands in his you look almost well yes i am much better archibald but i am warm now and flushed we have waited here some time and the setting sun was full upon us how long the boat was in coming in the wind was against us replied mr carlyle wondering who the exquisite was at his wifes side he thought he remembered his face captain levison said lady isabel i wrote you word in one of my letters that he was here have you forgotten it yes it had slipped from his memory and i am happy that it happened so said that gentleman interposing for it has enabled me to attend lady isabel in some of her </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> her walks she is stronger now but at first she was unfit to venture alone i feel much indebted to you said mr carlyle warmly the following day was sunday and francis levison was asked to dine with themthe first meal he had been invited to in the house after dinner when lady isabel left them he grew confidential over his claret to mr carlyle laying open all his intricate affairs and his cargo of troubles this compulsory exile abroad is becoming intolerable he concluded and a paris life plays the very deuce with one do you see any chance of my getting back to england not the least was the candid answer unless you can manage to satisfy or partially satisfy those claims you have been telling me of will not sir peter assist you i believe he would were the case fairly represented to him but how am i to get over to do it i have written several letters to him lately and for some time i got no reply then came an epistle from lady levison not short and sweet but short and sour it was to the effect that sir peter was ill and could not at present be troubled with business matters he cannot be very ill remarked mr carlyle he passed through west lynne in his open carriage a week ago he ought to help me grumbled captain levison i am his heir so long as lady levison does not give him one i do not hear that she has expectations you should contrive to see him i know i should but it is not possible under present circumstances with these thunderclouds hanging over me i dare not set foot in england and run the risk to be dropped upon i can stand a few things but i shudder at the bare idea of a prison something peculiar in my idiosyncrasy i take it for those who have tried it say that its nothing when youre used to it some one might see him for you some onewho i have quarreled with my lawyers sharp steel of lincolns inn keen practitioners put in mr carlyle too keen for me id send them over the herringpond if i could they have used me shamefully since my uncles marriage if ever i do come into the levison estates theyll be ready to eat their ears off they would like a finger in a pie with such property as that shall i see sir peter levison for you will you returned captain levison his dark eyes lighting up if you like as your friend you understand not as your solicitor that i decline i have a slight knowledge of sir peter my father was well acquainted with him and if i can render you any little service i shall be happy in return for your kind attention to my wife i cannot promise to see him for those two or three weeks though resumed mr carlyle for we are terribly busy i never was so driven but for being so i should stay here with my wife francis levison expressed his gratitude and the prospect however remote of being enabled to return to england increased his spirits to exultation whilst they continued to converse lady isabel sat at the window in the adjoining room listlessly looking out on the crowds of french who were crowding to and from the port in their sunday holiday attire looking at them with her eyes not with her sensesher senses were holding commune with herself and it was not altogether satisfactoryshe was aware that a sensation all too warm a feeling of attraction toward francis levison was working within her not a voluntary one she could no more repress it than she could repress her own sense of being and mixed with it was the stern voice of conscience overwhelming her with the most lively terror she would have given all she possessed to be able to overcome it she would have given half the years of her future life to separate herself at once and forever from the man but do not mistake the word terror or suppose that lady isabel carlyle applied it here in the vulgar acceptation of the term she did not fear for herself none could be more conscious of selfrectitude of principle and conduct and she would have believed it as impossible for her ever to forsake her duty as a wife a gentlewoman and a christian as for the sun to turn round from west to east that was not the fear which possessed her it had never presented itself to her mind what she did fear was that further companionship with francis levison might augment the sentiments she entertained for him to a height that her life for perhaps years to come would be one of unhappiness a sort of concealment and more than all she shrank form the consciousness of the bitter wrong that these sentiments cast upon her husband archibald i have a favor to ask you she said after captain levisons departure take me back with you impossible my love the change is doing you so much good and i took the apartments for six weeks you must at least remain that time the color flowed painfully into her cheek i cannot stay without you archibald tell me why i am so dull without you was all she could say he felt that this was not reason enough for altering an arrangement that was so beneficial to her so he left her the following morning commending her to the continued care of captain levison </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxi quitting the danger lady isabel was seated on one of the benches of the petit camp as it is called underneath the ramparts of the upper tower a week or ten days had passed away since the departure of mr carlyle and in her health there was a further visible improvement it was still evening cool for july no sound was heard save the hum of the summer insects and lady isabel sat in silence with her companion her rebellious heart beating with a sense of its own happiness but for the voice of conscience strong within her but for the sense of right and wrong but for the existing things in short but that she was a wife she might have been content to sit by his side forever never to wish to move or to break the silence did he read her feelings he told her months afterward that he did but it may have been a vain boast an excuse do you remember the evening lady isabel just such a one as this that we all passed at richmond he suddenly asked your father mrs vane you i and others yes i remember it we had spent a pleasant day the two miss challoners were with us you drove mrs vane home and i went with papa you drove recklessly i recollect and mrs vane said when we got home that you should never drive her again which meant not until the next time of all capricious vain exacting women emma vane was the worst and emma mount severn is no improvement upon it shes a systematic flirt and nothing better i drove recklessly on purpose to put her in a fright and pay her off what had she done put me in a rage she had saddled herself upon me when i wantedi wished for another to be my companion blanche challoner blanche challoner echoed captain levison in a mocking tone what did i care for blanche challoner isabel remembered that he had been supposed in those days to care a great deal for miss blanche challonera most lovely girl of seventeen mrs vane used to accuse you of caring too much for her she said aloud she accused me of caring for some one else more than for blanche challoner he significantly returned and for once her jealous surmises were not misplaced no lady isabel it was not blanche challoner i had wished to drive home could you not have given a better guess than that at the time he added turning to her there was no mistaking the tone of his voice or the glance of his eye lady isabel felt a crimson flush rising and she turned her face away the past is gone and cannot be recalled he continued but we both played our cards like simpletons if ever two beings were formed to love each other you and i were i sometimes thought you read my feelings surprise had kept her silent but she interrupted him now haughtily enough i must speak lady isabel it is but a few words and then i am silent forever i would have declared myself had i dared but my uncertain position my debts my inability to keep a wife weighed me down and instead of appealing to sir peter as i ought to have done for the means to assume a position that would justify me in asking lord mount severns daughter i crushed my hopes within me and suffered you to escape i will not hear this captain levison she cried rising from her seat in anger he touched her arm to place her on it again one single moment yet i pray you i have for years wished that you should know why i lost youa loss that tells upon me yet i have bitterly worked out my own folly since i knew not how passionately i loved you until you became the wife of another isabel i love you passionately still how dare you presume so to address me she spoke in a cold dignified tone of hauteur as it was her bounden duty to speak but nevertheless she was conscious of an undercurrent of feeling whispering that under other auspices the avowal would have brought to her heart the most intense bliss what i have said can do no hurt now resumed captain levison the time has gone by for it for neither you nor i are likely to forget that you are a wife we have each chosen our path in life and must abide by it the gulf between us is impassable but the fault was mine i ought to have avowed my affection and not have suffered you to throw yourself away upon mr carlyle throw myself away she indignantly uttered roused to the retort mr carlyle is my dear husband esteemed respected and beloved i married him of my own free choice and i have never repented it i have grown more attached to him day by day look at his noble nature his noble form what are you by his side you forget yourself francis levison he bit his lip no i do not you are talking to me as you have no right to talk she exclaimed in agitation who but you would so insult me taking advantage of my momentarily unprotected condition would you dare to do it were mr carlyle within reach i wish you goodevening sir she walked away as quickly as her tired frame would permit captain levison strode after her he took forcible possession of her hand and placed it within his arm i pray you forgive and forget what has escaped me lady isabel suffer me to be as before the kind friend the anxious brother endeavoring to be of service to you in the absence of mr carlyle it is what i have suffered you to be looking upon you as i may say a relative she coldly rejoined withdrawing her hand from his contact not else should i have permitted your incessant companionship and this is how you have repaid it my husband thanked you for your attention to me could he have read what was in your false heart he had offered you different sort of thanks i fancy i ask your pardon lady isabel i have acknowledged my fault and i can do no more i will not so offend again but there are moments when our dearest feelings break through the convenances of life and betray themselves in spite of our sober judgment suffer me to support you down this steep hill he added for they were then going over the sharp </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense2> sharp stones of the grand rue you are not strong enough to proceed alone after this evenings long walk you should have thought of that before she said with some sarcasm in her tone no i have declined so she had to put his arm back which he was holding out as she walked on unsupported with what strength she had he continuing by her side arriving at her own door she wished him a cool goodevening and he turned away in the direction of his hotel lady isabel brushed past peter and flew upstairs startling wilson who had taken possession of the drawingroom to air her smart cap at its windows in the absence of her lady my desk wilson immediately cried she bearing off her gloves her bonnet and her shawl tell peter to be in readiness to take a letter to the post and he must walk fast or he will not catch it before the english mail is closed the symptoms of sinful happiness throbbing at her heart while francis levison told her of his love spoke plainly to lady isabel of the expediency of withdrawing entirely from his society and his dangerous sophistries she would be away from the very place that contained him put the sea between them so she dashed off a letter to her husband an urgent summons that he should come to her without delay for remain away longer she would not it is probable she would have started alone not waiting for mr carlyle but for fear of not having sufficient funds for the journey after the rent and other things were paid mr carlyle when he received the letter and marked its earnest tone wondered much in reply he stated that he would be with her on the following saturday and then her returning or not with him could be settled fully determined not to meet captain levison isabel in the intervening days only went out in a carriage he called once and was shown into the drawingroom but lady isabel who happened to be in her own chamber sent out a message which was delivered by peter my ladys compliments but she must decline receiving visitors sunday morningit had been impossible for him to get away beforebrought mr carlyle he strongly combatted her wish to return home until six weeks should have expired he nearly said he would not take her and she grew earnest over it almost to agitation isabel he said let me know your motive for it appears to me you have one the sojourn here is evidently doing you a vast deal of good and what you urge about being dull sounds very like nonsense tell me what it is a sudden impulse flashed over her that she would tell him the truth not tell him that she loved francis levison or that he had spoken to her as he did she valued her husband too greatly to draw him into any unpleasantness whose end could not be seen but own to him that she had once felt a passing fancy for francis levison and preferred not to be subjected to his companionship now oh that she had done so her kind her noble her judicious husband why did she not the whole truth as to her present feelings it was not expedient that she should tell but she might have confided to him quite sufficient he would only have cherished her the more deeply and sheltered her under his fostering care safe from harm why did she not in the impulse of the moment she was about to do so when mr carlyle who had been taking a letter from his pocket book put it into her hand upon what slight threads the events of life turn her thoughts diverted she remained silent while she opened the letter it was from miss carlyle who had handed it to her brother in the moment of his departure to carry to lady isabel and save postage mr carlyle had nearly dropped it into the folkestone post office a letter as stiff as miss corny herself the children were well and the house was going on well and she hoped lady isabel was better it filled three sides of note paper but that was all the news it contained and it wound up with the following sentence i would continue my epistle but barbara hare who is to spend the day with us has just arrived barbara hare spending the day at east lynne that item was quite enough for lady isabel and her heart and her confidence closed to her husband she must go home to her children she urged she could not remain longer away from them and she urged it at length with tears nay isabel said mr carlyle if you are so much in earnest as this you shall certainly go back with me then she was like a child let loose from school she laughed she danced in her excess of content she showered kisses on her husband thanking him in her gleeful gratitude mr carlyle set it down to her love for him he arrived at the conclusion that in reiterating that she could not bear to be away from him she spoke the fond truth isabel he said smiling tenderly upon her do you remember in the first days of our marriage you told me you did not yet love me but that the love would come i think this is it her face flushed nearly to tears at the words a bright glowing all too conscious flush mr carlyle mistook its source and caught her to his heart lady isabel had returned home to bodily health to the delight of meeting her children to the glad sensation of security but as the days went on a miserable feeling of apathy stole over her a feeling as if all whom she had loved in the world had died leaving her living and alone she did not encourage these reflections knowing what you do know of her you may be sure of that but they thrust themselves continually forward the form of francis levison was ever present to her not a minute of the day but it gave the coloring to her thoughts and at night it made the subject of her dreams oh those dreams they were painful to wake from painful from the contrasts they presented to reality and equally painful to her conscience in its strife after what was right mr carlyle mounted his horse one morning and rode over to levison park he asked for sir peter but was shown into the presence of lady levisona young and pretty woman dressed showily she inquired his business my business madam is with sir peter but sir peter is not well enough to attend to business it upsets himworries him nevertheless i am here by his own appointment twelve oclock he mentioned and the hour has barely struck lady levison bit her lip and bowed coldly and at that moment a servant appeared to conduct mr carlyle to sir peter the matter which had taken mr carlyle thither was entered upon immediatelyfrancis levison his debts and his gracelessness sir peter an old gentleman in a velvet skullcap particularly enlarged upon the latter id pay his debts today and set him upon his legs again but that i know i should have to do the same thing over and over again to the end of the chapter as i have done it repeatedly hitherto cried sir peter his grandfather was my only brother his father my dutiful and beloved nephew but he is just as bad as they were estimable he is a worthless fellow and nothing else mr carlyle his tale drew forth my compassion and i promised i would see you and speak for him returned mr carlyle of captain levisons personal virtues or vices i know nothing and the less you know the better growled sir peter i suppose he wants me to clear him and start him afresh something of that sort i conclude but how is it to be done i am at home and he is over there his affairs are in a state of confusion and nobody can come to the bottom of them without an explanation from him some liabilities for which i have furnished the money the creditors swear have not been liquidated he must come over if he wants anything done where is he to come to he must be in england sub rosa he cant be here hastily rejoined sir peter lady levison would not have him for a day he might be at east lynne goodnaturedly observed mr carlyle nobody would think of looking for him there i think it is a pity that you should not meet if you do feel inclined to help him you are a deal more considerate to him than he deserves mr carlyle may i ask if you intend to act for him in a professional capacity i do not a few more words and it was decided that captain levison should be immediately sent for as mr carlyle left sir peters presence he encountered lady levison i can scarcely be ignorant that your conference with my husband has reference to his grandnephew she observed it has replied mr carlyle i have had a very bad opinion of him mr carlyle at the same time i do not wish you to carry away a wrong impression of me francis levison is my husbands nephew his presumptive heir it may therefore appear strange that i set my face against him two or three years ago previous to my marriage with sir peter in fact before i knew sir peter i was brought into contact with francis levison he got acquainted with some friends of mine and at their house i met him he behaved shamefully ill he repaid their hospitality with gross ingratitude other details and facts regarding his conduct also became known to me altogether i believe him to be a base and despicable man both by nature and inclination and that he will remain such to the end of time i know very little indeed of him observed mr carlyle may i inquire the nature of his illconduct in that instance he ruined themhe ruined them mr carlyle they were simple unsuspicious country people understanding neither fraud nor vice nor the ways of an evil world francis levison got them to put their names to bills as a matter of form to accommodate him for a month or so he stated and so they believed they were not wealthy they lived upon their own small estate with none too much of superfluous money to spare and when the time came for them to payas come it didit brought ruin and they had to leave their home he deliberately did itknowing what would be the end and i could tell you of other things sir peter may have informed you that i object to receive him here i do my objection is to the manto his character not owing as i hear it has been said to any jealous paltry feeling touching his being the heir i must lose my own selfrespect before i admit francis levison to my house as an inmate sir peter may assist him in welcomemay pay his debt and get him out of his scrapes as often as he pleases but i will not have him here sir peter said you declined to receive him but it is necessary that he should come to england if his affairs are to be set straight and also that he should see sir peter come to england interrupted lady levison how can he come to england under present circumstances unless indeed he comes en cachette en cachette of course replied mr carlyle there is no other way i have offered to let him stay at east lynne he is you may be aware a sort of connection of lady isabels take care that he does not repay your hospitality with ingratitude warmly returned lady levison it would only be in accordance with his practice mr carlyle laughed i do not see what harm he could do me allowing that he had the inclination he would </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> would not scare my clients from me or beat my children and i can take care of my pocket a few days will no doubt be the extent of his sojourn lady levison smiled too and shook hands with mr carlyle in your house perhaps there may be no field for his vagaries but rely upon it where there is one he is sure to be at some mischief or other this visit of mr carlyles to levison park took place on a friday morning and on his return to his office he dispatched an account of it to captain levison at boulogne telling him he had better come over but now mr carlyle like many another man whose mind has its share of work was sometimes forgetful of trifles and it entirely slipped his memory to mention the expected arrival at home the following evening saturday he and lady isabel were dining in the neighborhood when the conversation at table turned upon the ducies and their embarrassments the association of ideas led mr carlyles thoughts to boulogne to captain levison and his embarrassments and it immediately occurred to him that he had not told his wife of the anticipated visit he kept it in his mind then and spoke as soon as they were in the chariot returning home isabel began he i suppose we have always rooms ready for visitors because i am expecting one oh yes or if not they are soon made ready ah but tomorrows sunday and i have no doubt thats the day he will take advantage of to come i am sorry i forgot to mention it yesterday who is coming then captain levison who repeated lady isabel in a sharp tone of consternation captain levison sir peter consents to see him with a view to the settlement of his liabilities but lady levison declines to receive him at the park so i offered to give him houseroom at east lynne for a few days there is an old saying the heart leaping into the mouth and lady isabels leaped into hers she grew dizzy at the wordsher senses seemed momentarily to desert her her first sensation was as if the dull earth had opened and shown her a way into paradise her second a lively consciousness that francis levison ought not to be suffered to come again into companionship with her mr carlyle continued to converse of the mans embarrassments of his own interview with sir peter and lady levison but isabel was as one who heard not she was debating the question how she could prevent his coming archibald she presently said i do not wish francis levison to stay at east lynne it will only be for a few daysperhaps but a day or two sir peter is in the humor to discharge the claims and the moment his resolve is known the excaptain can walk on her majestys dominions an unmolested man free to go where he will that may be interrupted lady isabel in an accent of impatience but why should he come to our house i proposed it myself i had no idea you would dislike his coming why should you i dont like francis levison she murmured that is i dont care to have him at east lynne my dear i fear there is no help for it now he is most likely on his road and will arrive tomorrow i cannot turn him out again after my own voluntary invitation had i known it would be disagreeable to you i would not have proposed it tomorrow she exclaimed all the words that caught her ear is he coming tomorrow being sunday a free day he will be sure to take advantage of it what has he done that you should object to his coming you did not say in boulogne that you disliked him he had done nothing was her faltering answer feeling that her grounds of opposition must melt under her one by one lady levison appears to possess a very ill opinion of him resumed mr carlyle she says she knew him in years gone by she mentioned one or two things which if true must be bad enough but possibly she may be prejudiced she is prejudiced said isabel at least francis levison told me at boulogne there appeared to be no love lost between them at any rate his ill doings or well doings cannot affect us for the short period he is likely to remain you have taken a prejudice against him also i suppose isabel she suffered mr carlyle to remain in the belief and sat with clasped hands and a despairing spirit feeling that fate was against her how could she accomplish her task of forgetting this man if he was thus to be thrown into her home and her companionship suddenly she turned to her husband and laid her cheek upon his shoulder he thought she was tired he passed his arm round her waist drew her face to a more comfortable position and bent his own lovingly upon it it came to her mind as she lay there to tell him a portion of the truth like it had done once before it was a strong arm of shelter that round hera powerful pillar of protection him upon whom she leaned why did she not confide herself to him as trustingly as a little child simply because her courage failed once twice the opening words were upon her lips but come forth they did not and then the carriage stopped at east lynne and the opportunity was over oh how many a time in her after years did lady isabel recall that midnight drive with her husband and wish in her vain repentance that she had opened his eyes to that dangerous man on sunday captain levison arrived at east lynne </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxii mrs hares dream the next day rose bright warm and cloudless and the morning sun streamed into the bedroom of mrs hare mr and mrs hare were of the oldfashioned class who knew nothing about dressingrooms their bedrooms were very large and they never used a dressingroom in their lives or found the want of one the justice rubbed his face to a shining brilliancy settled on his morning wig and his dressinggown and then turned to the bed what will you have for breakfast thank you richard i do not think that i can eat any thing i shall be glad of my tea i am very thirsty all nonsense responded the justice alluding to the intimation of not eating have a poached egg mrs hare smiled at him and gently shook her head you are very kind richard but i could not eat it this morning barbara may send up the smallest bit of dry toast would you please throw the window open before you go down i should like to feel the air you will get the air too near from this window replied mr justice hare opening the further one had his wife requested that the further one to be opened he would have opened the other his own will and opinions were ever paramount then he descended a minute or two and up ran barbara looking bright and fair as the morning her pink muslin dress with its ribbons and its open white lace sleeves as pretty as she was she leaned over to kiss her mother mamma are you ill and you have been so well lately you went to bed so well last night papa says barbara dear interrupted mrs hare glancing round the room with dread and speaking in a deep whisper i have had one of those dreadful dreams again oh mamma how can you exclaimed barbara starting up in vexation how can you suffer a foolish dream to overcome you as to make you ill you have good sense in other matters but in this you seem to put all sense away from you child will you tell me how i am to help it returned mrs hare taking barbaras hand and drawing her to her again i do not give myself the dreams i cannot prevent their making me sick prostrate feverish how can i help these things i ask at this moment the bedroom door was flung open and the face of the justice especially stern and cross then was pushed in so startled was mrs hare that she shook till she shook the pillow and barbara sprang away from the bed surely he had not distinguished their topic of conversation are you coming to make the breakfast today or not barbara do you expect me to make it she is coming this instant richard said mrs hare her voice more faint than usual and the justice turned and stamped down again barbara could your papa have heard me mention richard no no mamma impossible the door was shut i will bring up your breakfast myself and then you can tell me the dream barbara flew after mr hare poured out his coffee saw him settled at his breakfast with a plateful of grousepie before him and then returned upstairs with her mammas tea and dry toast go on with your dream mamma she said but your breakfast will be cold child oh dont mind that did you dream of richard not very much of richard except that the old and continuous trouble of his being away and unable to return seemed to pervade it all through you remember barbara richard asserted to us in that short hidden night visit that he did not commit the murder that it was another who did yes i remember it replied barbara barbara i am convinced he spoke the truth i trust him implicitly i feel sure of it also mamma i asked him you remember whether it was otway bethel who committed it for i have always doubted bethel in an indefinite vague manner richard replied it was not bethel but a stranger well barbara in my dream i thought that stranger came to west lynne that he came to this house here and we were talking to him of him conversing as we might with any other visitor mind you we seemed to know that he was the one who actually did it but he denied it he wanted to put it upon richard and i saw him yes i did barbarawhisper to otway bethel but oh i cannot tell you the sickening horror that was upon me throughout and seemed to be upon you also lest he should make good his own apparent innocence and crush richard his victim i think the dread and horror awoke me what was he like this stranger asked barbara in a low tone well i cannot quite tell the recollection of his appearance seemed to pass away from me with the dream he was dressed as a gentleman and we conversed with him as an equal barbaras mind was full of captain thorn but his name had not been mentioned to mrs hare and neither would she mention it now she fell into deep thought and mrs hare had to speak twice before she could be aroused barbara i say dont you think this dream coming uncalled for uninduced must forebode some ill rely upon it something connected with that wretched murder is going to be stirred up again you know i do not believe in dreams was barbaras answer i think when people say this dream is a sign of such and such a thing it is the greatest absurdity in the world i wish you could remember what the man seemed like in your dream i wish i could answered mrs hare breaking off a particle of her dry toast all i can remember is that he appeared to be a gentleman was he tall had he black hair mrs hare shook her heard i tell you my dear the remembrance has passed from me so whether his hair was black or light i cannot say i think he was tall but he was sitting down and otway bethel stood behind his chair i seemed to feel that richard was outside the door in hiding trembling lest the man should go out and see him there and i trembled </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> trembled too oh barbara it was a distressing dream i wish you could avoid having them mamma for they seem to upset you very much why did you ask whether the man was tall and had black hair barbara returned an evasive answer it would not do to tell mrs hare that her suspicions pointed to one particular quarter it would have agitated her too greatly so vivid was the dream she could scarcely persuade herself when she awoke that it was not real and the murderer actually at west lynne oh barbara barbara she exclaimed in a wailing tone when will this mystery be cleared and my own restored to me seven years since he stole here to see us and no tidings yet people say that changes come every seven years mamma said barbara hopefully but i will go down and send you up some more tea and guard your countenance well returned her mother dont let your father suspect anything remember his oath to bring richard to justice if he thought we dwelt on his innocence there is no knowing what he might do to find him he is so very just so very cruel and unnatural i call it mamma but never fear my betraying anything but have you heard about joyce no what is it she had a severe fall while playing with little isabel and it is said she will be confined to bed for several weeks i am very sorry for her and composing her face she descended to the breakfastroom the dinner hour at the hares when they were alone was four oclock and it arrived that day as usual and they sat down to table mrs hare was better then the sunshine and the business of stirring life had in some measure effaced the visions of the night and restored her to her wonted frame of mind the cloth removed the justice sat but a little while over his port wine for he was engaged to smoke an afterdinner pipe with a brother magistrate mr justice herbert shall you be home to tea papa inquired barbara is it any business of yours young lady oh not in the least answered miss barbara only if you had been coming home to tea i suppose we must have waited had you not been in time i thought you said richard that you were going to stay the evening with mr herbert observed mrs hare so i am responded the justice but barbara has a great liking for the sound of her own tongue the justice departed striding pompously down the gravel walk barbara waltzed round the large room to a gleeful song as if she felt his absence a relief perhaps she did you can have tea now mamma at any time you please if you are thirsty without waiting till seven quoth she barbara said mrs hare what mamma i am sorry to hear of the calamity which has fallen upon joyce i should like to walk to east lynne this evening and inquire after her and see her if i may it would be but neighborly i feel quite equal to it since i have accustomed myself to take more exercise i feel better for it you know and we have not been out today poor joyce what time shall we go barbara if we were to get there byby seven i should think their dinner will be over then yes answered mrs hare with alacrity who was always pleased when somebody else decided for her but i should like some tea before we start barbara barbara took care that her mamma should have some tea and then they proceeded toward east lynne it was a lovely eveningthe air warm and the humming gnats sported in it as if to make the most of the waning summer mrs hare enjoyed it at first but ere she reached east lynne she became aware that the walk was too much for her she did not usually venture upon half so long a one and probably the fever and agitation of the morning had somewhat impaired her days strength she laid her hand upon the iron gate as they turned into the park and stood still i did wrong to come barbara lean on me mamma when you reach those benches you can take a good rest before proceeding to the house it is very warm and that may have fatigued you they gained the benches which were placed under some of the park trees in front of the gates and the road but not of the house and mrs hare sat down another minute and they were surrounded mr carlyle his wife and sister who were taking an afterdinner stroll amidst the flowers with their guest francis levison discerned them and came up the children except the youngest were of the party lady isabel warmly welcomed mrs hare she had become quite attached to the delicate and suffering woman a pretty one i am am i not archibald to come inquiring after one invalid and am so much of an invalid myself that i have to stop halfway mrs hare exclaimed as mr carlyle shook her hand i was so greatly concerned to hear of poor joyce you must stay the evening now you are here cried lady isabel it will afford you a good rest and tea will refresh you oh thank you but we have taken tea said mrs hare there is no reason why you should not take some more she laughed indeed you seem too fatigued to be anything but a prisoner with us for the next hour or two i fear i am answered mrs hare who the dickens are they captain levison was muttering to himself as he contemplated the guests from a distance its a deuced pretty girl whoever she may be i think ill approach they dont look formidable he did approach and the introduction was made captain levison mrs hare and miss hare a few formal words and captain levison disappeared again challenging little william carlyle to a footrace how very poorly your mamma looks mr carlyle exclaimed to barbara when they were beyond the hearing of mrs hare who was busy talking with lady isabel and miss carlyle and she has appeared so much stronger lately altogether better the walk here has fatigued her i feared it would be too long so that she looks unusually pale replied barbara but what do you think it is that has upset her again mr carlyle he turned his inquiring eyes upon barbara papa came downstairs this morning saying mamma was ill that she had one of her old attacks of fever and restlessness i declare as papa spoke i thought to myself could mamma have been dreaming some foolish dream againfor you remember how ill she used to be after them i ran upstairs and the first thing that mamma said to me was that she had had one of those dreadful dreams i fancied she must have outlived her fear of them that her own plain sense had come to her aid long ago showing her how futile dreams are meaning nothing even if hers do occasionally touch upon thatthat unhappy mystery you may just as well reason with a post as reason with mamma when she is suffering from the influence of one of those dreams returned barbara i tried it this morning i asked her to call upas you observegood sense to her aid and her reply was how could she help her feelings she did not induce the dream by thinking of richard or in any other way and yet it came and shattered her of course so far mamma is right for she cannot help the dreams coming mr carlyle made no immediate reply he picked up a ball belonging to one of the children which lay in his path and began tossing it gently in his hand it is a singular thing he observed presently that we do not hear from richard oh very very and i know mamma distresses over it a few words which she let fall this morning betrayed it plainly i am no believer in dreams continued barbara but i cannot deny that these which take such a hold upon mamma do bear upon the case in a curious mannerthe one she had last night especially what was it asked mr carlyle she dreamed that the real murderer was at west lynne she thought he was at our houseas a visitor she said or like one making a morning calland we she and i were conversing with him about the murder he wanted to deny itto put it on richard and he turned and whispered to otway bethel who stood behind his chair this is another strange thing added barbara lifting her blue eyes in their deep earnestness to the face of mr carlyle what is strange you speak in enigmas barbara i mean that otway bethel should invariably appear in her dreams until that stolen visit of richards we had no idea he was near the spot at the time and yet he had always made a prominent feature in these dreams and who was the murdererin your mammas dream continued mr carlyle speaking as gravely as though he were upon a subject that men ridicule not she cannot remember except that he seemed a gentleman and that we held intercourse with him as such now that again is remarkable we never told her you know of our suspicions of captain thorn i think you must be becoming a convert to the theory of dreams yourself barbara you are so very earnest smiled mr carlyle no not to dreams but i am earnest for my dear brother richards sake that thorn does not appear in a hurry again to favor west lynne with his mr carlyle paused for barbara had hurriedly laid her hand upon his arm with a warning gesture in talking they had wandered across the park to its ornamental grounds and were now in a quiet path overshadowed on the other side by a chain of imitation rocks seated astride on the summit of these rocks right above where mr carlyle and barbara were standing was francis levison his face was turned from them and he appeared intent upon a childs whip winding leather round its handle whether he heard their footsteps or not he did not turn they quickened their pace and quitted the walk bending their steps backward toward the group of ladies could he have heard what we were saying ejaculated barbara below her breath mr carlyle looked down upon the concerned flushed cheeks with a smile barbara was so evidently perturbed but for a certain episode of their lives some years ago he might have soothed her tenderly i think he must have heard a little barbara unless his wits were woolgathering he might not be attending what if he did hear it is of no consequence i was speaking you know of captain thornof his being the murderer you were not speaking of richard or his movements so never mind levison is a stranger to the whole it is nothing to him if he did hear the name of thorn mentioned or even distinguished the subject it would bear for him no interestwould go as the saying runs in at one ear and out at the other be at rest barbara he really did look somewhat tenderly upon her as he spokeand they were near enough to lady isabel for her to note the glance she need not have been jealous it bore no treachery to her but she did note it she had noted also their wandering away together and she jumped to the conclusion that it was premeditated that they had gone beyond her sight to enjoy each others society for a few stolen moments wonderfully attractive looked barbara that evening for mr carlyle or any one else to steal away with her tasty elegant airy summer attire her bright blue eyes her charming features and her damask cheeks she had untied the strings of her pretty white bonnet and was restlessly playing with them more in thought than nervousness barbara love how are we to get home asked mrs </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> mrs hare i do fear i shall never walk it i wish i had told benjamin to bring the phaeton i can send to him said mr carlyle but it is too bad of me archibald to take you and lady isabel by storm in this unceremonious manner and to give your servants trouble besides a great deal too bad i think returned mr carlyle with mock gravity as to the servants the one who has to go will never get over the trouble depend upon it you always were more concerned for others than for yourself dear mrs hare and you were always kind archibald smoothing difficulties for all and making a trouble of nothing ah lady isabel were i a young woman i should be envying you your good husband there are not many like him possibly the sentence reminded lady isabel that another who was young might be envying her for her cheeksisabelsflushed crimson mr carlyle held out his strong arm of help to mrs hare if sufficiently rested i fancy you would be more comfortable on a sofa indoors allow me to support you thither and you can take my arm on the other side cried miss carlyle placing her tall form by mrs hare between us both we will pull you bravely along your feet need scarcely touch the ground mrs hare laughed but said she thought mr carlyles arm would be sufficient she took it and they were turning toward the house when her eye caught the form of a gentleman passing along the road by the park gate barbara run she hurriedly exclaimed theres tom herbert going toward our house and he will just call in and tell them to send the phaeton if you ask him which will save the trouble to mr carlyles servants of going expressly make haste child you will be up with him in half a minute barbara thus urged set off on the spur of the moment toward the gates before the rest of the party well knew what was being done it was too late for mr carlyle to stop her and repeat that the servant should go for barbara was already up with mr tom herbert the latter had seen her running toward him and waited at the gate are you going past our house inquired barbara perceiving then that otway bethel also stood there but just beyond the view of the women yes why replied tom herbert who was not famed for his politeness being blunt by nature and fast by habit mamma would be so much obliged to you if you would just call in and leave word that benjamin is to bring up the phaeton mamma walked here intending to walk home but she finds herself so fatigued as to be unequal to it all right ill call and send him what time nothing had been said to barbara about the time so she was at liberty to name her own ten oclock we shall be home then before papa that you will responded tom herbert he and the governor and two or three more old codgers are blowing clouds till you cant see across the room and they are sure to get at it after supper i say miss barbara are you engaged for a few picnics good for a great many returned barbara our girls want to get up some in the next week or two jacks home you know is he said barbara in surprise we had a letter yesterday and he came todaya brother officer with him jack vows if the girls dont cater well for them in the way of amusement hell never honor them by spending his leave at home again so mind you keep yourself in readiness for any fun that may turn up good evening good evening miss hare added otway bethel as barbara was returning the salutation she became conscious of other footsteps advancing from the same direction that they had come and moved her head hastily round two gentlemen walking arminarm were close upon her in one of whom she recognized jack otherwise major herbert he stopped and held out his hand it is some years since we met but i have not forgotten the pretty face of miss barbara he cried a young girls face it was then but it is a stately young ladys now barbara laughed your brother has just told me you had arrived at west lynne but i did not know you were so close to me he has been asking me if i am ready for some pic barbaras voice faltered and the rushing crimson dyed her face whose face was that who was he standing opposite to her side by side with john herbert she had seen the face but once yet it had implanted itself upon her memory in characters of fire major herbert continued to talk but barbara for once lost her selfpossession she could not listen she could only stare at that face as if fascinated to the gaze looking herself something like a simpleton her shy blue eyes anxious and restless and her lips turning to an ashy whiteness a strange feeling of wonder of superstition was creeping over barbara was that man behind her in sober veritable realityor was it but a phantom called up in her mind by the associations rising from her mammas dream or by the conversation held not many moments ago with mr carlyle major herbert may have deemed that barbara who evidently could not attend to himself but was attending to his companion wished for an introduction and he accordingly made it captain thornmiss hare then barbara roused herself her senses were partially coming to her and she became alive to the fact that they must deem her behavior unorthodox for a young lady ii looked at captain thorn for i thought i remembered his face she stammered i was in west lynne for a day or two some five years ago he observed ahyes returned barbara are you going to make a long stay now we have several weeks leave of absence whether we shall remain here all the time i cannot say barbara parted from them thought upon thought crowded upon her brain as she flew back to east lynne she ran up the steps to the hall gliding toward a group which stood near its further endher mother miss carlyle mr carlyle and little isabel lady isabel she did not see mrs hare was then going up to see joyce in the agitation of the moment she stealthily touched mr carlyle and he stepped away from the rest to speak to her she drawing back toward the door of one of the reception rooms and motioning him to approach oh archibald i must speak to you alone could you not come out again for a little while he nodded and walked out openly by her side why should he not what had he to conceal but unfortunately lady isabel who had but gone into that same room for a minute and was coming out again to join mrs hare both saw barbaras touch upon her husbands arm marked her agitation and heard her words she went to one of the hall windows and watched them saunter toward the more private part of the ground she saw her husband send back isabel never since her marriage had lady isabels jealousy been excited as it was excited that evening ii feeli scarcely know whether i am awake or dreaming began barbara putting up her hand to her brow and speaking in a dreamy tone pardon me for bringing you out in this unceremonious fashion what state secrets have you to discuss asked mr carlyle in a jesting manner we were speaking of mammas dream she said the impression it had left upon her mindthat the murderer was in west lynnewas so vivid that in spite of common sense she could not persuade herself that he was not welljust now barbara what can be the matter uttered mr carlyle perceiving that her agitation was so great as to impede her words i have just seen him she rejoined seen him echoed mr carlyle looking at her fixedly a doubt crossing his mind whether barbaras mind might be as uncollected as her manner what were nearly my last words to you that if ever that thorn did come to west lynne again i would leave no stone unturned to bring it home to him he is here archibald now when i went to the gate to speak to tom herbert his brother major herbert was also there and with him captain thorn bethel also do you wonder i say that i know not whether i am awake or dreaming they have some weeks holiday and are here to spend it it is a singular coincidence exclaimed mr carlyle had anything been wanting to convince me that thorn is the guilty man this would have done it went on barbara in her excitement mammas dream with the steadfast impression it left upon her that hallijohns murderer was now at west lynne in turning the sharp corner of the covered walk they came in contact with captain levison who appeared to be either standing or sauntering there his hands underneath his coattails again barbara felt vexed wondering how much he had heard and beginning in her heart to dislike the man he accosted them familiarly and appeared as if he would have turned with them but none could put down presumption more effectually than mr carlyle calm and gentlemanly though he always was i will join you presently captain levison he said with a wave of the hand and he turned back with barbara toward the open parts of the park do you like that captain levison she abruptly inquired when they were beyond hearing i cannot say i do was mr carlyles reply he is one who does not improve upon acquaintance to me it looks as though he had placed himself in our way to hear what we were saying no no barbara what interest could it bear for him barbara did not contest the point she turned to the one nearer at heart what must be our course with regard to thorn it is more than i can tell you replied mr carlyle i cannot go up to the man and unceremoniously accuse him of being hallijohns murderer they took their way to the house for there was nothing further to discuss captain levison entered it before them and saw lady isabel standing at the hall window yes she was standing and looking still brooding over her fancied wrongs who is that miss hare he demanded in a cynical tone they appear to have a pretty good understanding together twice this evening i have met them enjoying a private walk and a private confab what did you say sharply and haughtily returned lady isabel nay i did not mean to offend you was the answer for he knew that she heard his words distinctly in spite of her question i spoke of monsieur votre mari </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxiii captain thorn in trouble about a bill in talking over a bygone misfortune we sometimes make the remark or hear it made to us circumstances worked against it such and such a thing might have turned out differently we say had the surrounding circumstances been more favorable but they were in opposition they were dead against it now if ever attendant circumstances can be said to have borne a baneful influence upon any person in this world they most assuredly did at this present time against lady isabel carlyle coeval you see with the arrival of the excaptain levison at east lynne all the jealous feeling touching her husband and barbara hare was renewed and with greater force than ever barbara painfully anxious that something should be brought to light it would have puzzled her to say how or by what means by which her brother should be exonerated from the terrible charge under which he lay fully believing that frederick thorn captain in her majestys service was the man who had committed the crime as asserted by richard was in a state of excitement bordering upon frenzy too keenly she felt the truth </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> truth of her own words that she was powerless that she could herself do nothing when she rose in the morning after a night passed in troubled reflection more than in sleep her thoughts were oh that i could this day find out something certain she was often at the herberts frequently invited theresometimes going uninvited she and the herberts were intimate and they pressed barbara into all the impromptu gay doings now their brother was at home there she of course saw captain thorn and now and then she was enabled to pick up scraps of his past history eagerly were these scraps carried to mr carlyle not at his office barbara would not appear there perhaps she was afraid of the gossiping tongues of west lynne or that her visits might have come to the knowledge of that stern prying and questioning old gentleman whom she called sire it may be too that she feared if seen haunting mr carlyles office captain thorn might come to hear of it and suspect the agitation that was afloatfor who could know better than he the guilt that was falsely attaching to richard therefore she chose rather to go to east lynne or to waylay mr carlyle as he passed to and from business it was little she gathered to tell him one evening she met him with the news that mr thorn had been in former years at west lynne though she could not fix the date another time she went boldly to east lynne in eager anxiety ostensibly to make a call on lady isabeland a very restless one it wascontriving to make mr carlyle understand that she wanted to see him alone he went out with her when she departed and accompanied her as far as the park gates the two evidently absorbed in earnest converse lady isabels jealous eye saw that the communication barbara had to make was that captain thorn had let fall the avowal that he had once been in trouble though of its nature there was no indication given another journey of hers took the scrap of news that she had discovered he knew swainson well part of this nay perhaps the whole of it mr carlyle had found out for himself nevertheless he always received barbara with vivid interest richard hare was related to miss carlyle and if his innocence could be made clear in the sight of men it would be little less gratifying to them than to the hares of richards innocence mr carlyle now entertained little if any doubt and he was becoming impressed with the guilt of captain thorn the latter spoke mysteriously of a portion of his past lifewhen he could be brought to speak of it at alland he bore evidently some secret that he did not care to have alluded to but now look at the mean treachery of that man francis levison the few meetings that lady isabel did witness between her husband and barbara would have been quite enough to excite her anger and jealousy to trouble her peace but in addition francis levison took care to tell her of those she did not see it pleased himhe could best tell with what motiveto watch the movements of mr carlyle and barbara there was a hedge pathway through the fields on the opposite side of the road to the residence of justice hare and as mr carlyle walked down the road to business in his unsuspicion not one time in fifty did he choose to ride the walk to and fro kept him in health he said captain levison would be strolling down like a serpent behind the hedge watching all his movements watching his interviews with barbara did any take place watching mr carlyle turn into the grove as he sometimes did and perhaps watch barbara run out of the house to meet him it was all related over and with miserable exaggeration to lady isabel whose jealousy as a natural sequence grew feverish in its extent it is scarcely necessary to explain that of this feeling of lady isabels barbara knew nothing not a shadow of suspicion had ever penetrated to her mind that lady isabel was jealous of her had she been told that such was the fact she would have laughed in derision at her informant mr carlyles happy wife proudly secure in her position and in his affection jealous of her of her to whom he had never given an admiring look or a loving word it would have taken a great deal to make barbara believe that how different were the facts in reality these meetings of mr carlyles and barbaras instead of episodes of lovemaking and tender speeches were positively painful especially to barbara from the unhappy nature of the subject to be discussed far from feeling a reprehensible pleasure at seeking the meetings with mr carlyle barbara shrank from them but that she was urged by dire necessity in the interests of richard she would wholly have avoided such poor barbara in spite of that explosion of bottledup excitement years back was a lady possessed of a ladys ideas and feelings andremembering the explosionit did not accord with her pride at all to be pushing herself into what might be called secret meetings with archibald carlyle but barbara in her sisterly love pressed down all thought of self and went perseveringly forward for richards sake mr carlyle was seated one morning in his private room at his office when his head clerk mr dill came in a gentleman is asking to see you mr archibald i am too busy to see anybody for this hour to come you know that dill so i told him sir and he says hell wait it is that captain thorn who is staying here with john herbert mr carlyle raised his eyes and they encountered those of the old man a peculiar expression was in the face of both mr carlyle glanced down at the parchment he was perusing as if calculating his time then he looked up again and spoke i will see him dill send him in the business leading to the visit was quite simple captain frederick thorn had got himself into some trouble and vexation about a billas too many captains will doand he had come to crave advice of mr carlyle mr carlyle felt dubious about giving it this captain thorn was a pleasant attractive sort of a man who won much on acquaintance one whom mr carlyle would have been pleased in a friendly point of view and setting professional interest apart to help out of his difficulties but if he were the villain they suspected him to be the man with crime upon his hand then mr carlyle would have ordered his office door held wide for him to slink out of it cannot you advise me what my course ought to be he inquired detecting mr carlyles hesitation i could advise you certainly butyou must excuse my being plain captain thorni like to know who my clients are before i take up their cause or accept them as clients i am able to pay you was captain thorns reply i am not short of ready money only this bill mr carlyle laughed out after having bit his lip with annoyance it was a natural inference of yours he said but i assure you i was not thinking of your purse or my pocket my father held it right never to undertake business for a strangerunless a man was good in a respectable point of view and his cause was good he did not mention itand i have acted on the same principle by these means the position and character of our business is rarely attained by a solicitor now in saying that you are a stranger to me i am not casting any doubt upon you captain thorn i am merely upholding my common practice my family is well connected was captain thorns next venture excuse me family has nothing to do with it if the poorest day laborer if a pauper out of the workhouse came to me for advice he should be heartily welcome to it provided he were an honest man in the face of the day again i repeat you must take no offence at what i say for i cast no reflection on you i only urge that you and your character are unknown to me curious words from a lawyer to a clientaspirant and captain thorn found them so but mr carlyles tone was so courteous his manner so affable in fact he was so thoroughly the gentleman that it was impossible to feel hurt well how can i convince you that i am respectable i have served my country ever since i was sixteen and my brother officers have found no cause of complaintany position as an officer and a gentleman would be generally deemed a sufficient guarantee inquire of john herbert the herberts too are friends of yours and they have not disdained to give me room amidst their family true returned mr carlyle feeling that he could not well object further and also that all men should be deemed innocent until proved guilty at any rate i will advise you what must be done at present he added though if the affair is one that must go on i do not promise that i can continue to act for you i am very busy just now captain thorn explained his dilemma and mr carlyle told him what to do in it were you not at west lynne some ten years ago he suddenly inquired at the close of the conversation you denied it to me once at my house but i concluded from an observation you let fall that you had been here yes i was replied captain thorn in a confidential tone i dont mind owning it to you in confidence but i do not wish it to get abroad i was not at west lynne but in its neighborhood the fact is when i was a careless young fellow i was stopping a few miles from here and got into a scrape though aain short it was an affair of gallantry i did not show out very well at the time and i dont care that it should be known in the country again mr carlyles pulsefor richard hares sakebeat a shade quicker the avowal of an affair of gallantry was almost a confirmation of his suspicions yes he pointedly said the girl was afy hallijohn afywho repeated captain thorn opening his eyes and fixing them on mr carlyles afy hallijohn captain thorn continued to look at mr carlyle an amused expression rather than any other predominant on his features you are mistaken he observed afy hallijohn i never heard the name before in my life did you ever hear or know that a dreadful tragedy was enacted in this place about that period replied mr carlyle in a low meaning tone that afy hallijohns father was oh stay stay stay hastily interrupted captain thorn i am telling a story in saying i never heard her name afy hallijohn why thats the girl tom herbert was telling me aboutwhowhat was itdisappeared after her father was murdered murdered in his own cottagealmost in afys presencemurdered byby mr carlyle recollected himself he had spoken more impulsively than was his custom hallijohn was my fathers faithful clerk for many years he more calmly concluded and he who committed the murder was young hare son of justice hare and brother to that attractive girl barbara your speaking of this has recalled what they told me to my recollection the first evening i was at the herberts justice hare was there smokinghalf a dozen pipes there were going at once i also saw miss barbara that evening at your park gates and tom told me of the murder an awful calamity for the hares i suppose that is the reason the young lady is miss hare still one with her good fortune and good looks ought to have changed her name ere this no it is not the reason returned mr carlyle what is the reason then a faint flush tinged the brow of mr carlyle i know more than one who </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> who would be glad to get barbara in spite of the murder do not depreciate miss hare not i indeed i like the young lady too well replied captain thorn the girl afy has never been heard of since has she never said mr carlyle do you know her well he deliberately added i never knew her at all if you mean afy hallijohn why should you think i did i never heard of her till tom herbert amused me with the history mr carlyle most devoutly wished he could tell whether the man before him was speaking the truth or falsehood he continued afys favorsi speak in no invidious sensei mean her smiles and chatterwere pretty freely dispersed for she was heedless and vain amidst others who got the credit for occasional basking in her rays was a gentleman of the name of thorn was it not yourself captain thorn stroked his moustache with an air that seemed to say he could boast of his share of such baskings in short as if he felt half inclined to do it upon my word he simpered you do me too much honor i cannot confess to having been favored by miss afy then she was not thethe damsel you speak of who drove youif i understand arightfrom the locality resumed mr carlyle fixing his eyes upon him so as to take in every tone of the answer and shade of countenance as he gave it i should think not indeed it was a married lady mores the pity young pretty vain and heedless as you represent this afy things went smoother after a time and she and her husbanda stupid country yeomanbecame reconciled but i have been ashamed of it since i have grown wiser and i do not care ever to be recognized as the actor in it or to have it raked up against me captain thorn rose and took a somewhat hasty leave was he or was he not the man mr carlyle could not solve the doubt mr dill came in as he disappeared closed the door and advanced to his master speaking in an under tone mr archibald has it struck you that the gentleman just gone out may be the lieutenant thorn you once spoke to me abouthe who had used to gallop over from swainson to court afy hallijohn it has struck me so most forcibly replied mr carlyle dill i would give five hundred pounds out of my pocket this moment to be assured of the factif he is the same i have seen him several times since he has been staying with the herberts pursued the old gentleman and my doubts have naturally been excited as to whether it could be the man in question curious enough bezant the doctor was over here yesterday from swainson and as i was walking with him arminarm we met captain thorn the two recognized each other and bowed merely as distant acquaintances do you know that gentleman said i to bezant yes he answered it is mr frederick mr frederick with something added on to it said i his name is thorn i know that returned bezant but when he was in swainson some years ago he chose to drop the thorn and the town in general knew him only as mr frederick what was he doing there bezant i asked amusing himself and getting into mischief was the answer nothing very bad only the random scrapes of young men was he often on horseback riding to a distance was my next question yes that he was replied bezant none more fond of galloping across the country than he i used to tell him hed ride his horses tail off now mr archibald what do you think concluded the old clerk and so far as i could make out this was about the very time of the tragedy at hallijohns think replied mr carlyle what can i think but that it is the same man i am convinced of it now and leaning back into his chair he fell into a deep reverie regardless of the parchments that lay before him the weeks went ontwo or threeand things seemed to be progressing backward rather than forwardif thats not irish francis levisons affairsthat is the adjustment of themdid not advance at all another thing that may be said to be progressing backward for it was going on fast to bad instead of good was the jealousy of lady isabel how could it be otherwise kept up as it was by barbaras frequent meetings with mr carlyle and by captain levisons exaggerated whispers of them discontented ill at ease with herself and with everybody about her isabel was living now in a state of excitement a dangerous resentment against her husband beginning to rise up in her heart that very daythe one of captain levisons visit to levison parkin driving through west lynne in the pony carriage she had come upon her husband in close converse with barbara hare so absorbed were they that they never saw her though her carriage passed close to the pavement where they stood on the morning following this as the hare family were seated at breakfast the postman was observed coming toward the house barbara sprang from her seat to the open window and the man advanced to her only one miss it is for yourself who is it from began the justice as barbara returned to her chair in letters as in other things he was always curious to know their contents whether they might be addressed to himself or not it is from anne papa replied barbara as she laid the letter by her side on the table why dont you open it and see what she says i will directly i am just going to pour out some more tea for mamma finally the justice finished his breakfast and strolled out into the garden barbara opened her letter mrs hare watched her movements and her countenance she saw the latter flush suddenly and vividly and then become deadly pale she saw barbara crush the note in her hand when read oh mamma she uttered the flush of emotion came also into mrs hares delicate cheeks barbara is it bad news mamma ititis about richard she whispered glancing at the door and window to see that none might be within sight or hearing i never thought of him i only fancied anne might be sending me some bit of news concerning her own affairs good heavens how fortunatehow providential that papa did not see the paper fall and that you did not persist in your inquiries if he barbara you are keeping me in suspense interrupted mrs hare who had also grown white what should anne know about richard barbara smoothed out the writing and held it before her mother it was as follows i have had a curious note from r it was without date or signature but i knew his handwriting he tells me to let you know in the most sure and private manner that i can that he will soon be paying another night visit you are to watch the grove every evening when the present moon gets bright mrs hare covered her face for some minutes thank god for all his mercies she murmured oh mamma but it is an awful risk for him to run but to know that he is in lifeto know that he is in life and for the riskbarbara i dread it not the same god who protected him through the last visit will protect him through this he will not forsake the oppressed the innocent destroy the paper child archibald carlyle must first see it mamma i shall not be easy until it is destroyed barbara braving the comments of the gossips hoping the visit would not reach the ears or eyes of the justice barbara went that day to the office of mr carlyle he was not there he was at west lynne he had gone to lynneborough on business and mr dill thought it a question if he would be at the office again that day if so it would be late in the afternoon barbara as soon as their own dinner was over took up her patient station at the gate hoping to see him pass but the time went by and he did not she had little doubt that he had returned home without going to west lynne what should she do go up to east lynne and see him said her conscience barbaras mind was in a strangely excited state it appeared to her that this visit of richards must have been specially designed by providence that he might be confronted by thorn mamma she said returning indoors after seeing the justice depart upon an evening visit to the bucks head where he and certain other justices and gentlemen sometimes congregated to smoke and chat i shall go up to east lynne if you have no objection i must see mr carlyle away went barbara it had struck seven when she arrived at east lynne is mr carlyle disengaged mr carlyle is not yet home miss my lady and miss carlyle are waiting dinner for him a check for barbara the servant asked her to walk in but she declined and turned from the door she was in no mood for visit paying lady isabel had been standing at the window watching for her husband and wondering what made him so late she observed barbara approach the house and saw her walk away again presently the servant who had answered the door entered the drawingroom was not that miss hare yes my lady was the mans reply she wanted master i said your ladyship was at home but she would not enter isabel said no more she caught the eyes of francis levison fixed on her with as much meaning compassionate meaning as they dared express she clasped her hands in pain and turned again to the window barbara was slowly walking down the avenue mr carlyle was then in sight walking quickly up it lady isabel saw their hands meet in greeting oh i am so thankful to have met you barbara exclaimed to him impulsively i actually went to your office today and i have been now to your house we have such news ay what about thorn no about richard replied barbara taking the scrap of paper from the folds of her dress this came to me this morning from anne mr carlyle took the document and barbara looked over him whilst he read it neither of them thinking that lady isabels jealous eyes and captain levisons evil ones were strained upon them from the distant windows miss carlyles also for the matter of that archibald it seems to me that providence must be directing him hither at this moment our suspicions with regard to thorn can now be set at rest you must contrive that richard shall see him what can he be coming again for more money was the supposition of mr carlyle does mrs hare know of this she does unfortunately i opened the paper before her never dreaming it was connected with richardpoor unhappy richardand not to be guilty he acted as though he were guilty barbara and that line of conduct often entails as much trouble as real guilt you do not believe him guilty she most passionately uttered i do not i have little doubt of the guilt of thorn oh if it could but be brought home to him returned barbara so that richard might be cleared in the sight of day how can you contrive that he shall see thorn i cannot tell i must think it over let me know the instant he arrives barbara of course i shall it may be that he does not want money that his errand is only to see mamma he was always so fond of her i must leave you said mr carlyle taking her hand in token of farewell then as a thought occurred to him he turned and walked a few steps with her without releasing it he was probably unconscious that he retained it she was not you know barbara if he should want money and </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> and it be not convenient to mrs hare to supply it at so short a notice i can give it to him as i did before thank you thank you archibald mamma felt sure you would she lifted her eyes to his with an expression of gratitude a warmer feeling for an uncontrolled moment mingled with it mr carlyle nodded pleasantly and then set off toward his house at the pace of a steam engine two minutes in his dressingroom and he entered the drawingroom apologizing for keeping them waiting dinner and explaining that he had been compelled to go to his office to give some orders subsequent to his return to lynneborough lady isabels lips were pressed together and she preserved an obstinate silence mr carlyle in his unsuspicion did not notice it what did barbara hare want demanded miss carlyle during dinner she wanted to see me on business was his reply given in a tone that certainly did not invite his sister to pursue the subject will you take some more fish isabel what was that you were reading over with her pursued the indefatigable miss corny it looked like a note ah that would be telling returned mr carlyle willing to turn it off with gayety if young ladies choose to make me party to their love letters i cannot betray confidence you know what rubbish archibald quoth she as if you could not say outright what barbara wants without making a mystery of it and she seems to be always wanting you now mr carlyle glanced at his sister a quick peculiar look it seemed to her to speak both of seriousness and warning involuntarily her thoughtsand her fearsflew back to the past archibald archibald she uttered repeating the name as if she could not get any further words out in her dread ititis neverthat old affair is never being raked up again now miss carlyles old affair referred to one sole and sore pointrichard hare and so mr carlyle understood it lady isabel unhappily believing that any old affair could only have reference to the bygone loves of her husband and barbara you will oblige me by going on with your dinner cornelia gravely responded mr carlyle thenassuming a more laughing tonei tell you it is unreasonable to expect me to betray a young womans secrets although she may choose to confide them professionally to me what say you captain levison the gentleman addressed bowed a smile of mockery all too perceptible to lady isabel on his lips and miss carlyle bent her head over her plate and went on with her dinner as meek as any lamb that same evening lady isabels indignant and rebellious heart condescended to speak of it when alone with her husband what is it that she wants with you so much that barbara hare it is private business isabel she has to bring me messages from her mother must the business be kept from me he was silent for a moment considering whether he might tell her but it was impossible he could speak even to his wife of the suspicion they were attaching to captain thorn it would have been unfair and wrong neither could he betray that a secret visit was expected from richard to no one in the world could he betray that however safe and true it would not make you the happier to know it isabel there is a dark secret you are aware touching the hare family it is connected with that she did not put faith in a word of the reply she believed he could not tell her because her feelings as his wife would be outraged by the confession and it goaded her anger into recklessness mr carlyle on his part never gave a thought to the supposition that she might be jealous he had believed that nonsense at an end years ago he was perfectly honorable and true strictly faithful to his wife giving her no shadow of cause or reason to be jealous of him and being a practical matteroffact man it did not occur to him that she could be so lady isabel was sitting the following morning moody and out of sorts captain levison who had accompanied mr carlyle in the most friendly manner possible to the park gate on his departure and then stolen along the hedgewalk had returned to lady isabel with the news of an ardent interview with barbara who had been watching for his going by at the gate of the grove she sat sullenly digesting the tidings when a note was brought in it proved to be an invitation to dinner for the following tuesday at a mrs jeffersonsfor mr and lady isabel carlyle and miss carlyle do you go asked miss carlyle yes replied isabel mr carlyle and i both want a change of some sort she added in a mocking sort of spirit it may be well to have it if only for an evening in truth this unhappy jealousy this distrust of her husband appeared to have altered lady isabels very nature and leave captain levison returned miss carlyle lady isabel went over to her desk making no reply what will you do with him i ask persisted miss carlyle he can remain herehe can dine by himself shall i accept the invitation for you no i shall not go said miss carlyle then in that case there can be no difficulty in regard to captain levison coldly spoke lady isabel i dont want his companyi am not fond of it cried miss carlyle i would go to mrs jeffersons but that i should want a new dress thats easily had said lady isabel i shall want one myself you want a new dress uttered miss carlyle why you have a dozen i dont know that i could count a dozen in all returned lady isabel chafing at the remark and the continual thwarting put upon her by miss carlyle which had latterly seemed more than hard to endure petty evils are more difficult to support than great ones take notice lady isabel concluded her note folded sealed it and then rang the bell as the man left the room with it she desired that wilson might be sent to her is it this morning wilson that the dressmaker comes to try on miss isabels dress she inquired wilson hesitated and stammered and glanced from her mistress to miss carlyle the latter looked up from her work the dressmakers not coming spoke she sharply i countermanded the order for the frock for isabel does not require it she does require it answered lady isabel in perhaps the most displeased tone she had ever used to miss carlyle i am a competent judge of what is necessary for my children she no more requires a new frock than that table requires one or that you require the one you are longing for stoically persisted miss carlyle she has got ever so many lying by and her striped silk turned will make up as handsome as ever wilson backed out of the room and closed the door softly but her mistress caught a compassionate look directed toward her her heart seemed bursting with indignation and despair there seemed to be no side on which she could turn for refuge pitied by her own servants she reopened her desk and dashed off a haughty peremptory note for the attendance of the dressmaker at east lynne commanding its immediate dispatch miss corny groaned in her wrath you will be sorry for not listening to me maam when your husband shall be brought to poverty he works like a horse now and with all his slaving can scarcely i fear keep expenses down poor lady isabel ever sensitive began to think they might with one another be spending more than mr carlyles means would justify she knew their expenses were heavy the same tale had been dinned into her ears ever since she married him she gave up in that moment all thought of the new dress for herself and for isabel but her spirit in her deep unhappiness felt sick and faint within her wilson meanwhile had flown to

isabel and yet a few more days passed on </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxiv richard hare at mr dills window bright was the moon on that genial monday night bright was the evening star as they shone upon a solitary wayfarer who walked on the shady side of the road with his head down as though he did not care to court observation a laborer apparently for he wore a smockfrock and had hobnails in his shoes but his whiskers were large and black quite hiding the lower part of his face and his broadbrimmed wideawake came far over his brows he drew near the dwelling of richard hare esq plunged rapidly over some palings after looking well to the right and to the left into a field and thence over the side wall into mr hares garden where he remained amidst the thick trees now by some mischievous spirit of intuition or contrariety justice hare was spending this evening at home a thing he did not do once in six months unless he had friends with him things in real life do mostly go by the rules of contrary as children say in their play holding the corners of the handkerchief here we go round and round by the rules of contrary if i tell you to hold fast you must loose if i tell you to loose you must hold fast just so in the play of life when we want people to hold fast they loose and when we want them to loose they hold fast barbara anxious troubled worn out almost with the suspense of looking and watching for her brother feeling a feverish expectation that night would bring himbut so had she felt for the two or three nights pastwould have given her hand for her father to go out but nothings were going by the rule of contrary there sat the stern justice in full view of the garden and the grove his chair drawn precisely in front of the window his wig awry and a long pipe in his mouth are you not going out richard mrs hare ventured to say no mamma shall i ring for the shutters to be closed asked barbara by and by shutters closed said the justice whod shut out this bright moon you have got the lamp at the far end of the room young lady and can go to it barbara ejaculated an inward prayer for patiencefor safety of richard if he did come and waited on watching the grove in the distance it came the signal her quick eye caught it a movement as if some person or thing had stepped out beyond the trees and stepped back again barbaras face turned white and her lips dry i am so hot she exclaimed in her confused eagerness for an excuse i must take a turn in the garden she stole out throwing a dark shawl over her shoulders that might render her less conspicuous to the justice and her dress that evening was a dark silk she did not dare to stand still when she reached the trees or to penetrate them but she caught glimpses of richards face and her heart ached at the change in it it was white thin and full of care and his hair he told her was turning gray oh richard darling and i may not stop to talk to you she wailed in a deep whisper papa is at home you see of all the nights in the world cant i see my mother how can you you must wait till tomorrow night i dont like waiting a second night barbara theres danger in every inch of ground that this neighborhood contains but you must wait richard for reasons that man who caused all the mischiefthorn hang him gloomily interrupted richard he is at west lynne at least there is a thorn </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> thorn wei and mr carlylebelieve to be the same and we want you to see him let me see him panted richard whom the news appeared to agitate let me see him barbara i say barbara had passed on again returning presently you know richard i must keep moving with papas eyes there he is a tall man very goodlooking very fond of dress and ornament especially of diamonds thats he cried richard eagerly mr carlyle will contrive that you shall see him she continued stooping as if to tie her shoe should it prove to be the same perhaps nothing can be doneimmediately donetoward clearing you but it shall be a great point ascertained are you sure you should know him again sure that i should know him uttered richard hare should i know my own father should i know you and are you not engraven on my heart in letters of blood as is he how and when am i to see him barbara i can tell you nothing till i have seen mr carlyle be here tomorrow as soon as ever the dusk will permit you perhaps mr carlyle will contrive to bring him here if the window was thrown open and the stentorian voice of justice hare was heard from it barbara are you wandering about there to take cold come in come in i say oh richard i am so sorry she lingered to whisper but papa is sure to be out tomorrow evening he would not stay in two evenings running goodnight dear there must be no delay now and the next day barbara braving comments appeared once more at the office of mr carlyle terribly did the rules of contrary seem in action just then mr carlyle was not in and the clerks did not know when to expect him he was gone out for some hours they believed mr dill urged barbara as the old gentleman came to the door to greet her i must see him he will not be in till late in the afternoon miss barbara i expect him then is it anything i can do no no sighed barbara at that moment lady isabel and her little girl passed in the chariot she saw barbara at her husbands door what should she be doing there unless paying him a visit a slight haughty bow to barbara a pleasant nod and smile to mr dill and the carriage bowled on it was four oclock before barbara could see mr carlyle and communicate her tidings that richard had arrived mr carlyle held deceit and all underhand doings in especial abhorrence yet he deemed that he was acting right under the circumstances in allowing captain thorn to be secretly seen by richard hare in haste he arranged his plans it was the evening of his own dinner engagement at mrs jeffersons but that he must give up telling barbara to dispatch richard to his office as soon as he should make his appearance at the grove and to urge him to come boldly and not fear for none would know him in his disguise he wrote a hurried note to thorn requesting him also to be at his office at eight oclock that evening as he had something to communicate to him the latter plea was no fiction for he had received an important communication that morning relative to the business on which captain thorn had consulted him and his own absence from the office in the day had alone prevented his sending for him earlier other matters were calling the attention of mr carlyle and it was five oclock ere he departed for east lynne he would not have gone so early but that he must inform his wife of his inability to keep his dinner engagement mr carlyle was one who never hesitated to sacrifice personal gratification to friendship or to business the chariot was at the door and lady isabel dressed and waiting for him in her dressingroom did you forget that the jeffersons dined at six was her greeting no isabel but it was impossible for me to get here before and i should not have come so soon but to tell you that i cannot accompany you you must make my excuses to mrs jefferson a pause strange thoughts were running through lady isabels mind why so she inquired some business has arisen which i am compelled to attend to this evening as soon as i have snatched a bit of dinner at home i must hasten back to the office was he making this excuse to spend the hours of her absence with barbara hare the idea that it was so took firm possession of her mind and remained there her face expressed a variety of feelings the most prominent that of resentment mr carlyle saw it you must not be vexed isabel i assure you it is no fault of mine it is important private business which cannot be put off and which i cannot delegate to dill i am sorry it should have so happened you never return to the office in the evening she remarked with pale lips no because if anything arises to take us there after hours dill officiates but the business tonight must be done by myself another pause lady isabel suddenly broke it shall you join us later in the evening i believe i shall not be able to do so she drew her light shawl around her shoulders and swept down the staircase mr carlyle followed to place her in the carriage when he said farewell she never answered but looked out straight before her with a stony look what time my lady inquired the footman as he alighted at mrs jeffersons early halfpast nine a little before eight oclock richard hare in his smockfrock and his slouching hat and his false whiskers rang dubiously at the outer door of mr carlyles office that gentleman instantly opened it he was quite alone come in richard said he grasping his hand did you meet any whom you knew i never looked at whom i met sir was the reply i thought that if i looked at people they might look at me so i came straight ahead with my eyes before me how the place has altered theres a new brick house on the corner where old morgans shop used to stand thats the new police station west lynne i assure you is becoming grand in public buildings and how have you been richard ailing and wretched answered richard hare how can i be otherwise mr carlyle with so false an accusation attached to me and working like a slave as i have to do you may take off the disfiguring hat richard no one is here richard slowly heaved it from his brows and his fair face so like his mothers was disclosed but the moment he was uncovered he turned shrinkingly toward the entrance door if any one should come in sir impossible replied mr carlyle the front door is fast and the office is supposed to be empty at this hour for if i should be seen and recognized it might come to hanging you know sir you are expecting that cursed thorn here barbara told me directly replied mr carlyle observing the mode of addressing him sir it spoke plainly of the scale of society in which richard had been mixing that he was with those who said it habitually nay that he used it habitually himself from your description of the lieutenant thorn who destroyed hallijohn we believe this captain thorn to be the same man pursued mr carlyle in person he appears to tally exactly and i have ascertained that a few years ago he was a deal at swainson and got into some sort of scrape he is in john herberts regiment and is here with him on a visit but what an idiot he must be to venture here uttered richard here of all places in the world he counts no doubt on not being known so far as i can find out richard nobody here did know him save you and afy i shall put you in mr dills roomyou may remember the little window in itand from thence you can take a full view of thorn whom i shall keep in the front office you are sure you would recognize him at this distance of time i should know him if it were fifty years to come i should know him were he disguised as i am disguised we cannot richard sank his voice forget a man who has been the object of our frenzied jealousy what has brought you to east lynne again richard any particular object chiefly a hankering within me that i could not get rid of replied richard it was not so much to see my mother and barbarathough i did want that especially since my illnessas that a feeling was within me that i could not rest away from it so i said id risk it again just for a day i thought you might possibly want some assistance as before i do want that also said richard not much my illness has run me into debt and if my mother can let me have a little i shall be thankful i am sure she will answered mr carlyle you shall have it from me tonight what has been the matter with you the beginning of it was a kick from a horse sir that was last winter and it laid me up for six weeks then in the spring after i got well and was at work again i caught some sort of fever and down again i was for six weeks i have not been to say well since how is it you have never written or sent me your address because i dared not answered richard timorously i should always be in fear not of you mr carlyle but of its becoming known some way or other the time is getting on sir is that thorn sure to come he sent me word that he would in reply to my note andthere he is uttered mr carlyle as a ring was heard at the bell now richard come this way bring your hat richard complied by putting his hat on his head pulling it so low that it touched his nose he felt himself safer in it mr carlyle showed him into mr dills room and then turned the key upon him and put it in his pocket whether this precautionary measure was intended to prevent any possibility of captain thorns finding his way in or of richards finding his way out was best known to himself mr carlyle came to the front door opened it and admitted captain thorn he brought him into the clerks office which was bright with gas keeping him in conversation for a few minutes standing and then asking him to be seatedall in full view of the little window i must beg your pardon for being late captain thorn observed i am half an hour beyond the time you mentioned but the herberts had two or three friends at dinner and i could not get away i hope mr carlyle you have not come to your office tonight purposely for me business must be attended to somewhat evasively answered mr carlyle i have been out myself nearly all day we received a communication from london this morning relative to your affair and i am sorry to say anything but satisfactory they will not wait but i am not liable mr carlyle not liable in justice noif what you tell me be correct but justice and law are sometimes in opposition captain thorn captain thorn sat in perplexity they will not get me arrested here will they they would have done it beyond doubt but i have caused a letter to be written and dispatched to them which must bring forth an answer before any violent proceedings are taken that answer will be here the morning after tomorrow and what am i do to then i think it is probable there may be a way of checkmating them but i am not sure captain thorn that i can give my attention </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> attention further to this affair i hope and trust you will was the reply you have not forgotten that i told you at first i could not promise to do so rejoined mr carlyle you shall hear from me tomorrow if i carry it on for you i will then appoint an hour for you to be here on the following day if notwhy i dare say you will find a solicitor as capable of assisting you as i am but why will you not what is the reason i cannot always give reasons for what i do was the response you will hear from me tomorrow he rose as he spoke captain thorn also rose mr carlyle detained him yet a few moments and then saw him out at the front door and fastened it he returned and released richard the latter took off his hat as he advanced into the blaze of light well richard is it the same man no sir not in the least like him mr carlyle though little given to emotion felt a strange reliefrelief for captain thorns sake he had rarely seen one whom he could so little associate with the notion of a murderer as captain thorn and he was a man who exceedingly won upon the regard he would heartily help him out of his dilemma now excepting that they are both tall with nearly the same color of hair there is no resemblance whatever between them proceeded richard their faces their figures are as opposite as light is from dark that other in spite of his handsome features had the expression at times of a demon but this ones expression is the best part of his face hallijohns murderer had a curious look here sir where questioned mr carlyle for richard had only pointed to his face generally welli cannot say precisely where it lay whether in the eyebrows or the eyes i could not tell when i used to have him before me but it was in one of them ah mr carlyle i thought when barbara told me thorn was here it was too good news to be true depend upon it he wont venture to west lynne again this man is no more like that other villain than you are like him thenas that is set at restwe had better be going richard you have to see your mother and she must be waiting in anxiety how much money do you want twentyfive pounds would do but richard stopped in hesitation but what asked mr carlyle speak out richard thirty would be more welcome thirty would put me at ease you shall take thirty said mr carlyle counting out the notes to him nowwill you walk with me to the grove or will you walk alone i mean to see you there in safety richard thought he would prefer to walk alone everybody they met might be speaking to mr carlyle the latter inquired why he chose moonlight nights for his visits it is pleasanter for travelling and had i chosen dark nights barbara could not have seen my signal from the trees was the answer of richard they went out and proceeded unmolested to the house of justice hare it was past nine then i am so much obliged to you mr carlyle whispered richard as they walked up the path i wish i could help you more effectually richard and clear up the mystery is barbara on the watch yes theres the door slowly opening richard stole across the hall and into the parlor to his mother barbara approached and softly whispered to mr carlyle standing just outside the portico her voice trembled with the suspense of what the answer might be is it the same manthe same thorn no richard says this man bears no resemblance to the real one oh uttered barbara in her surprise and disappointment not the same and for the best part of poor richards evening to have been taken up for nothing not quite nothing said mr carlyle the question is now set at rest set at rest repeated barbara it is left in more uncertainty than ever set at rest so far as regards captain thorn and whilst our suspicions were concentrated upon him we thought not of looking to other quarters when they entered the sittingroom mrs hare was crying over richard and richard was crying over her but she seized the hand of mr carlyle you have been very kind i dont know whatever we should do without you and i want to tax your kindness further has barbara mentioned it i could not talk in the hall mamma the servants might have overheard mr hare is not well and we terribly fear he will be home early in consequence otherwise we should have been quite safe until after ten for he is gone to the bucks head and they never leave you know till that hour has struck should he come in and see richardoh i need not enlarge upon the consequences to you archibald the very thought sends me into a shiver barbara and i have been discussing it all the evening and we can only think of one plan it is that you will kindly stay in the garden near the gate and should he come in stop him and keep him in conversation barbara will be with you and will run in with the warning and richard can go inside the closet in the hall till mr hare has entered and is safe in this room and then he can make his escape will you do this archibald certainly i will i cannot part with him before ten oclock unless i am forced she whispered pressing mr carlyles hands in her earnest gratitude you dont know what it is archibald to have a lost son home for an hour but once in seven years at ten oclock we will part mr carlyle and barbara began to pace in the path in compliance with the wish of mrs hare keeping near the entrance gate when they were turning the second time mr carlyle offered her his arm it was an act of mere politeness barbara took it and there they waited and waited but the justice did not come punctually to the minute half after nine lady isabels carriage arrived at mrs jeffersons and she came out immediatelya headache being the plea for her early departure she had not far to go to reach east lynneabout two milesand it was a byroad nearly all the way they could emerge into the open road if they pleased but it was a trifle further suddenly a gentleman approached the carriage as it was bowling along and waved his hand to the coachman to pull up in spite of the glowing moonlight lady isabel did not at first recognize him for he wore a disfigured fur cap the ears of which were tied over his ears and cheeks it was francis levison she put down the window i thought it must be your carriage how early you are returning were you tired of your entertainers why he knew what time my lady was returning thought john to himself he asked me a false sort of a chap that ive a notion i came out for a midnight stroll and have tired myself he proceeded will you take compassion on me and give me a seat home she acquiesced she could not do otherwise the footman sprang from behind the door and francis levison took his place beside lady isabel take the high road he put out his head to say to the coachman and the man touched his hatwhich high road would cause them to pass mr hares i did not know you she began gathering herself into her own corner what ugly thing is that you have on it is like a disguise he was taking off the ugly thing as she spoke and began to twirl it round his hand disguise oh no i have no creditors in the immediate neighborhood of east lynne false as ever it was worn as a disguise and he knew it is mr carlyle at home she inquired no then after a pausei expect he is more agreeably engaged the tone a most significant one brought the tingling blood to the cheeks of lady isabel she wished to preserve a dignified silence and did for a few moments but the jealous question broke out engaged in what manner as i came by hares house just now i saw two people a gentleman and a young lady coupled lovingly together enjoying a teteatete by moonlight unless i am mistaken he was the favored individual whom you call lord and master lady isabel almost gnashed her teeth the jealous doubts which had been tormenting her all the evening were confirmed that the man whom she hatedyes in her blind anger she hated him thenshould so impose upon her should excuse himself by lies lies base and false as he was from accompanying her out on purpose to pass the hours with barbara hare had she been alone in the carriage a torrent of passion had probably escaped her she leaned back panting in her emotion but hiding it from captain levison as they came opposite to justice hares she deliberately bent forward and scanned the garden with eager eyes there in the bright moonlight all too bright and clear slowly paced arm in arm and drawn close to each other her husband and barbara hare with a choking sob that could no longer be controlled or hidden lady isabel sunk back again he that bold bad man dared to put his arm around her to draw her to his side to whisper that his love was left to her if anothers was withdrawn she was most assuredly out of her senses that night or she never would have listened a jealous woman is mad an outraged woman is doubly mad and the illfated lady isabel truly believed that every sacred feeling which ought to exist between man and wife was betrayed by mr carlyle be avenged on that false hound isabel he was never worthy of you leave your life of misery and come to happiness in her bitter distress and wrath she broke into a storm of sobs were they caused by passion against her husband or by those bold and shameless words alas alas francis levison applied himself to soothe her with all the sweet and dangerous sophistry of his crafty nature the minutes flew on a quarter to ten now a quarter past ten and still richard hare lingered on with his mother and still mr carlyle and barbara paced patiently the garden path at halfpast ten richard came forth after having taken his last farewell then came barbaras tearful farewell which mr carlyle witnessed and then a hard grasp of that gentlemans hand and richard plunged amidst the trees to depart the way he came good night barbara said mr carlyle will you not come in and say good night to mamma not now it is late tell her how glad i am things have gone off so well he started off at a strapping pace toward his home and barbara leaned on the gate to indulge her tears not a soul passed to interrupt her and the justice did not come what could have become of him what could the bucks head be thinking of to retain respectable elderly justices from their beds who ought to go home early and set a good example to the parish barbara knew the next day that justice hare with a few more gentlemen had been seduced from the staid old inn to a friends house to an entertainment of supper pipes and whist two tables penny points and it was between twelve and one ere the party rose from the fascination so far wellas it happened barbara knew not how long she lingered at the gate ten minutes it may have been nobody summoned her mrs hare was indulging her grief indoors giving no thought to barbara and the justice did not make his appearance exceedingly surprised was barbara to hear fast footsteps and to find that they were mr carlyles the more haste </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> haste the less speed barbara he called out as he came up i had got halfway home and have had to come back again when i went into your sittingroom i left a small parcel containing a parchment on the sideboard will you get it for me barbara ran indoors and brought forth the parcel and mr carlyle with a brief word of thanks sped away with it she leaned on the gate as before the ready tears flowing again her heart was aching for richard it was aching for the disappointment the night had brought forth respecting captain thorn still nobody passed still the steps of her father were not heard and barbara stayed on butwhat was that figure cowering under the shade of the hedge at a distance and seemingly watching her barbara strained her eyes while her heart beat as if it would burst its bounds surely surely it was her brother what had he ventured back for richard hare it was when fully assured that barbara was standing there he knew the justice was still absent and ventured to advance he appeared to be in a strange state of emotionhis breath labored his whole frame trembling barbara barbara he called i have seen thorn barbara thought him demented i know you saw him she slowly said but it was not the right thorn not he breathed richard and not the gentleman i saw tonight in carlyles office i have seen the fellow himself why to you stare at me so barbara barbara was in truth scanning his face keenly it appeared to her a strange tale that he was telling when i left here i cut across into bean lane which is more private for me than this road proceeded richard just as i got to that clump of treesyou know it barbarai saw somebody coming toward me from a distance i stepped back behind the trunks of the trees into the shade of the hedge for i dont care to be met though i am disguised he came along the middle of the lane going toward west lynne and i looked out upon him i knew him long before he was abreast of me it was thorn barbara made no comment she was digesting the news every drop of blood within me began to tingle and an impulse came upon me to spring upon him and accuse him of the murder of hallijohn went on richard in the same excited manner but i resisted it or perhaps my courage failed one of the reproaches against me had used to be that i was a physical coward you know barbara he added in a tone of bitterness in a struggle thorn would have had the best of it he is taller and more powerful than i and might have battered me to death a man who can commit one murder wont hesitate at a second richard do you think you could have been deceived she urged you had been talking of thorn and your thoughts were naturally bearing upon him imagination be still barbara he interrupted in a tone of pain imagination indeed did i not tell you he was stamped here touching his breast do you take me for a child or an imbecile that i should fancy i see thorn in every shadow or meet people where i do not he had his hat off as if he had been walking fast and had got hotfast he was walking and he carried the hat in one hand and what looked like a small parcel with the other hand he was pushing the hair from his browin this waya peculiar way added richard slightly lifting his own hat and pushing back his hair by that action alone i should have known him for he was always doing it in the old days and there was his white hand adorned with his diamond ring barbara the diamond glittered in the moonlight richards voice and manner were singularly earnest and a conviction of the truth of his assertion flashed over his sister i saw his face as plainly as i ever saw itevery featurehe is scarcely altered save for a haggardness in his cheeks now barbara you need not doubt me i swear it was thorn she grew excited as he was now that she believed the news it was telling upon her reason left its place and impulse succeeded barbara did not wait to weigh her actions richard mr carlyle ought to know this he has but just gone we may overtake him if we try forgetting the strange appearances it would haveher flying along the public road at that hour of the nightshould she meet any who knew herforgetting what the consequence might be did justice hare return and find her absent barbara set off with a fleet foot richard more stealthily following herhis eyes cast in all directions fortunately barbara wore a bonnet and mantle which she had put on to pace the garden with mr carlyle fortunately also the road was remarkably empty of passengers she succeeded in reaching mr carlyle before he turned into east lynne gates barbara he exclaimed in the extreme of astonishment barbara archibald archibald she panted gasping for breath i am not out of my mindbut do come and speak to richard he has just seen the real thorn mr carlyle amazed and wondering turned back they got over the field stile nearly opposite the gates drew behind the hedge and there richard told his tale mr carlyle did not appear to doubt it as barbara had done perhaps he could not in the face of richards agitated and intense earnestness i am sure there is no one named thorn in the neighborhood save the gentleman you saw in my office tonight richard observed mr carlyle after some deliberation it is very strange he may be staying here under a feigned name replied richard there can be no mistake that it was thorn whom i have just met how was he dressed as a gentleman catch him dressing as anything else returned richard he was in an evening suit of black with a sort of thin overcoat thrown on but it was flung back at the shoulders and i distinctly saw his clothes a gray alpaca it looked like as i have told barbara i should have known him by this action of the hand imitating it as he pushed his hair off his forehead it was the delicate white hand of the days gone by mr carlyle it was the flashing of the diamond ring mr carlyle was silent barbara also but the thoughts of both were busy richard observed the former i should advise you to remain a day or two in the neighborhood and look out for this man you may see him again and may track him home it is very desirable to find out who he really is if practicable but the danger urged richard your fears magnify that i am quite certain that nobody would know you in broad daylight disguised as you are now so many years have flown since that people have forgotten to think about you richard but richard could not be persuaded he was full of fears he described the man as accurately as he could to mr carlyle and barbara and told them they must look out with some trouble mr carlyle got from him an address in london to which he might write in case anything turned up and richards presence should be necessary he then once more said farewell and quitted them his way lying past east lynne and now to see you back barbara said mr carlyle indeed you shall not do itlate as it is and tired as you must be i came here alone richard did not keep near me i cannot help your having come here alone but you may rely upon it i do not suffer you to go back so nonsense barbara allow you to go along the high road by yourself at eleven oclock at night what are you thinking of he gave barbara his arm and they pursued their way how late lady isabel will think you observed barbara i dont know that lady isabel has returned home yet my being late once in a while is of no consequence not another word was spoken save by barbara whatever excuse can i make should papa come home both were buried in their own reflections thank you very greatly she said as they reached her gate and mr carlyle finally turned away barbara stole in and found the coast clear her papa had not arrived lady isabel was in her dressingroom when mr carlyle entered she was seated at a table writing a few questions as to her evenings visit which she answered in the briefest way possible and then he asked her if she was not going to bed by and by i am not sleepy i must go at once isabel for i am dead tired and no wonder you can go was her answer he bent down to kiss her but she dexterously turned her face away he supposed that she felt hurt that he had not gone with her to the party and placed his hand on her shoulder with a pleasant smile you foolish child to be aggrieved at that it was no fault of mine isabel i could not help myself i will talk to you in the morning i am too tired tonight i suppose you will not be long her head was bent over her writing again and she made no reply mr carlyle went into his bedroom and shut the door some time after lady isabel went softly upstairs to joyces room joyce fast in her first sleep was suddenly aroused from it there stood her mistress a wax light in her hand joyce rubbed her eyes and collected her senses and finally sat up in bed my lady are you ill ill yes ill and wretched answered lady isabel and ill she did look for she was perfectly white joyce i want a promise from you if anything should happen to me stay at east lynne with my children joyce stared in amazement too much astonished to make any reply joyce you promised it once before promise it again whatever betide you you will stay with my children when i am gone i will stay with them but oh my lady what can be the matter with you are you taken suddenly ill goodbye joyce murmured lady isabel gliding from the chamber as quietly as she had entered it and joyce after an hour of perplexity dropped asleep again joyce was not the only one whose rest was disturbed that eventful night mr carlyle himself awoke and to his surprise found that his wife had not come to bed he wondered what the time was and struck his repeater a quarter past three rising he made his way to the door of his wifes dressingroom it was in darkness and so far as he could judge by the absence of sound unoccupied isabel no reply nothing but the echo of his own voice in the silence of the night he struck a match and lighted a taper partially dressed himself and went about to look for her he feared she might have been taken ill or else that she had fallen asleep in some one of the rooms but nowhere could he find her and feeling perplexed he proceeded to his sisters chamber door and knocked miss carlyle was a slight sleeper and rose up in bed at once whos that cried out she it is only i cornelia said mr carlyle you cried miss corny what in the name of fortune do you want you can come in mr carlyle opened the door and met the keen eyes of his sister bent on him from the bed her head was surmounted by a remarkable nightcap at least a foot high is anybody ill she demanded i think isabel must be i cannot find her not find her echoed miss corny why whats the time is she not in bed it is three oclock she had not been to bed i cannot find her </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> her in the sittingrooms neither is she in the childrens room then ill tell you what it is archibald shes gone worrying after joyce perhaps the girl may be in pain tonight mr carlyle was in full retreat toward joyces room at this suggestion when his sister called to him if anything is amiss with joyce you come and tell me archibald for i shall get up and see after her the girl was my servant before she was your wifes he reached joyces room and softly unlatched the door fully expecting to find a light there and his wife sitting by the bedside there was no light there however save that which came from the taper he held and he saw no signs of his wife where was she was it probable that joyce should tell him he stepped inside the room and called to her joyce started up in a fright which changed to astonishment when she recognized her master he inquired whether lady isabel had been there and for a few moments joyce did not answer she had been dreaming of lady isabel and could not at first detach the dream from the visit which had probably given rise to it what did you say sir is my lady worse i asked if she had been here i cannot find her why yes said joyce now fully aroused she came here and woke me that was just before twelve for i heard the clock strike she did not stay here a minute sir woke you repeated mr carlyle what did she want what did she come here for thoughts are quick imagination is still quicker and joyce was giving the reins to both her mistresss gloomy and ambiguous words were crowding on her brain three oclock and she had not been in bed and was not to be found in the house a nameless horror struggled to joyces face her eyes were dilating with it she seized and threw on a large flannel gown which lay on a chair by the bed and forgetful of her master who stood there out she sprang to the floor all minor considerations faded to insignificance beside the terrible dread which had taken possession of her clasping the flannel gown tight around her with one hand she laid the other on the arm of mr carlyle oh master oh master she has destroyed herself i see it all now joyce sternly interrupted mr carlyle she has destroyed herself as true as that we two are living here persisted joyce her own face livid with emotion i can understand her words now i could not before she came hereand her face was like a corpse as the light fell upon itsaying she had come to get a promise from me to stay with her children when she was gone i asked whether she was ill and she answered yes ill and wretched oh sir may heaven support you under this dreadful trial mr carlyle felt bewilderedperplexed not a syllable did he believe he was not angry with joyce for he thought she had lost her reason it is so sir incredible as you may deem my words pursued joyce wringing her hands my lady has been miserably unhappy and that has driven her to it joyce are you in your senses or out of them demanded mr carlyle a certain sternness in his tone your lady miserably unhappy what do you mean before joyce could answer an addition was received to the company in the person of miss carlyle who appeared in black stockings and a shawl and the lofty nightcap hearing voices in joyces room which was above her own and full of curiosity she ascended not choosing to be shut out from the conference whatevers up cried she is lady isabel found she is not found and she never will be found but in her windingsheet returned joyce whose lamentable and unusual state of excitement completely overpowered her customary quiet respect and plain good sense and maam i am glad that you have come up for what i was about to say to my master i would prefer to say in your presence when my lady is brought into this house and laid before us dead what will your feelings be my master has done his duty by her in love but youyou have made her life a misery yes maam you have hoitytoity muttered miss carlyle staring at joyce in consternation what is all this wheres my lady she has gone and taken the life that was not hers to take sobbed joyce and i say she has been driven to it she has not been allowed to indulge a will of her own poor thing since she came to east lynne in her own house she has been less free than either of her servants you have curbed her maam and snapped at her and you made her feel that she was but a slave to your caprices and temper all these years she has been crossed and put upon everything in short but beatenmaam you know she hasand has borne it all in silence like a patient angel never as i believe complaining to master he can say whether she has or not we all loved her we all felt for her and my masters heart would have bled had he suspected what she had to put up with day after day and year after year miss carlyles tongue was glued to her mouth her brother confounded at the rapid words could scarcely gather in their sense what is it that you are saying joyce he asked in a low tone i do not understand i have longed to say it to you many a hundred times sir but it is right that you should hear it now things have come to this dreadful ending since the very night lady isabel came home here your wife she had been taunted with the cost she has brought to east lynne and to you if she wanted but the simplest thing she was forbidden to have it and told that she was bringing her husband to poverty for this very dinner party that she went to tonight she wished for a new dress and your cruel words maam forbade her having it she ordered a new frock for miss isabel and you countermanded it you have told her that master worked like a dog to support her extravagances when you know that she never was extravagant that none were less inclined to go beyond proper limits than she i have seen her maam come away from your reproaches with the tears in her eyes and her hands meekly clasped upon her bosom as though life was heavy to bear a gentlespirited highborn lady as i know she was could not fail to be driven to desperation and i know that she has been mr carlyle turned to his sister can this be true he inquired in a tone of deep agitation she did not answer whether it was the shade cast by the nightcap or the reflection of the wax taper her face looked of a green cast and for the first time probably in miss carlyles life her words failed her may god forgive you cornelia he muttered as he went out of the chamber he descended to his own that his wife had laid violent hands upon herself his reason utterly repudiated she was one of the least likely to commit so great a sin he believed that in her unhappiness she might have wandered out in the grounds and was lingering there by this time the house was aroused and the servants were astir joycesurely a supernatural strength was given her for though she had been able to put her foot to the ground she had not yet walked upon itcrept downstairs and went into lady isabels dressingroom mr carlyle was hastily assuming the articles of attire he had not yet put on to go out and search the grounds when joyce limped in holding out a note joyce did not stand on ceremony that night i found this in the dressingglass drawer sir it is my ladys writing he took it in his hand and looked at the addressarchibald carlyle though a calm man one who had his emotions under his own control he was no stoic and his fingers shook as he broke the seal when years go on and my children ask where their mother is and why she left them tell them that you their father goaded her to it if they inquire what she is tell them also if you so will but tell them at the same time that you outraged and betrayed her driving her to the very depth of desperation ere she quitted them in her despair the handwriting his wifes swam before the eyes of mr carlyle all save the disgraceful fact that she had flownand a horrible suspicion began to dawn upon him with whomwas totally incomprehensible how had he outraged her in what manner had he goaded her to it the discomforts alluded to by joyce and the work of his sister had evidently no part in this yet what had he done he read the letter again more slowly no he could not comprehend it he had not the clue at that moment the voices of the servants in the corridor outside penetrated his ears of course they were peering about and making their own comments wilson with her long tongue the busiest they were saying that captain levison was not in his room that his bed had not been slept in joyce sat on the edge of a chairshe could not standwatching her master with a blanched face never had she seen him betray agitation so powerful not the faintest suspicion of the dreadful truth yet dawned upon her he walked to the door the open note in his hand then turned wavered and stood still as if he did not know what he was doing probably he did not then he took out his pocketbook put the note inside it and returned it to his pocket his hands trembling equally with his livid lips you need not mention this he said to joyce indicating the note it concerns myself alone sir does it say shes dead she is not dead he answered worse than that he added in his heart whywhos this uttered joyce it was little isabel stealing in with a frightened face in her white nightgown the commotion had aroused her whats the matter she asked wheres mamma child youll catch your death of cold said joyce go back to bed but i want mamma in the morning dear evasively returned joyce sir please must not isabel go back to bed mr carlyle made no reply to the question most likely he never heard its import but he touched isabels shoulder to draw joyces attention to the child joycemiss lucy in future he left the room and joyce remained silent from amazement she heard him go out at the hall door and bang it after him isabelnay we must say lucy alsowent and stood outside the chamber door the servants gathered in a group near did not observe her presently she came running back and disturbed joyce from her reverie joyce is it true is what true my dear they are saying that captain levison has taken away my mamma joyce fell back in her chair with a scream it changed to a long low moan of anguish what has he taken her forto kill her i thought it was only kidnappers who took people child child go to bed oh joyce i want mamma when will she come back joyce hid her face in her hands to conceal its emotion from the motherless child and just then miss carlyle entered on tiptoe and humbly sat down on a low chair her green facegreen that nightin its grief its remorse and its horror looking nearly as dark as her stockings she broke into a subdued wail god be merciful to this dishonored house mr justice hare turned into the gate between twelve and oneturned in with a jaunty air for the justice was in spirits he </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> he having won nine sixpences and his friends tap of ale having been unusually good when he reached his

that midnight hour and whom it contained </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxv charming results nearly a year went by lady isabel carlyle had spent it on the continentthat refuge for such fugitivesnow moving about from place to place with her companion now stationary and alone quite half the timetaking one absence with the otherhe had been away from her chiefly in paris pursuing his own course and his own pleasure how fared it with lady isabel just as it must be expected to fare and does fare when a highprincipled gentlewoman falls from her pedestal never had she experienced a moments calm or peace or happiness since the fatal night of quitting her home she had taken a blind leap in a moment of wild passion when instead of the garden of roses it had been her persuaders pleasure to promise her she would fall into but which in truth she had barely glanced at for that had not been her moving motive she had found herself plunged into a yawning abyss of horror from which there was never more any escapenever more never more the very instantthe very night of her departure she awoke to what she had done the guilt whose aspect had been shunned in the prospective assumed at once its true frightful color the blackness of darkness and a lively remorse a neverdying anguish took possession of her soul forever oh reader believe me ladywifemother should you ever be tempted to abandon your home so will you awake whatever trials may be the lot of your married life though they may magnify themselves to your crushed spirit as beyond the nature the endurance of woman to bear resolve to bear them fall down upon your knees and pray to be enabled to bear thempray for patiencepray for strength to resist the demon that would tempt you to escape bear unto death rather than forfeit your fair name and your good conscience for be assured that the alternative if you do rush on to it will be found worse than death poor thingpoor lady isabel she had sacrificed husband children reputation home all that makes life of value to woman she had forfeited her duty to god had deliberately broken his commandments for the one poor miserable mistake of flying with francis levison but the instant the step was irrevocable the instant she had left the barrier behind repentance set in even in the first days of her departure in the fleeting moments of abandonment when it may be supposed she might momentarily forget conscience it was sharply wounding her with its adder stings and she knew that her whole future existence whether spent with that man or without him would be a dark course of gnawing retribution nearly a year went by save some six or eight weeks when one morning in july lady isabel made her appearance in the breakfastroom they were staying now at grenoble taking that town on their way to switzerland through savoy it had been captain levisons pleasure to halt in it he engaged apartments furnished in the vicinity of the place grenette a windy old house it was full of doors and windows chimneys and cupboards and he said he should remain there lady isabel remonstrated she wished to go farther on where they might get quicker news from england but her will now was as nothing she was looking like the ghost of her former self talk of her having looked ill when she took that voyage over the water with mr carlyle you should have seen her nowmisery marks the countenance worse than sickness her face was white and worn her hands were thin her eyes were sunken and surrounded by a black circlecare was digging caves for them a stranger might have attributed these signs to the state of her health she knew betterknew that they were the effects of her wretched mind and heart it was very late for breakfast but why should she rise early only to drag through another endless day languidly she took her seat at the table just as captain levisons servant a frenchman whom he had engaged in paris entered the room with two letters point de gazette pierre she said non miladi and all the time the sly fox had got the times in his coat pocket but he was only obeying the orders of his master it had been captain levisons recent pleasure that the newspapers should not be seen by lady isabel until he had overlooked them you will speedily gather his motive pierre departed toward captain levisons room and lady isabel took up the letters and examined their superscription with interest it was known to her that mr carlyle had not lost a moment in seeking a divorce and the announcement that it was granted was now daily expected she was anxious for itanxious that captain levison should render her the only reparation in his power before the birth of her unhappy child little thought she that there was not the least intention on his part to make her reparation any more than he had made it to others who had gone before her she had become painfully aware of the fact that the man for whom she had chosen to sacrifice herself was bad but she had not learned all his badness yet captain levison unwashed unshaven with a dressinggown loosely flung on lounged in to breakfast the deckedout dandies before the world are frequently the greatest slovens in domestic privacy he wished her good morning in a careless tone of apathy and she as apathetically answered to it pierre says there are some letters he began what a precious hot day it is two was her short reply her tone sullen as his for if you think my good reader that the flattering words the ardent expressions which usually attend the first gooff of these promising unions last out a whole ten months you are in egregious error compliments the very opposite to honey and sweetness have generally supervened long before try it if you dont believe me two letters she continued and they are both in the same handwritingyour solicitors i believe up went his hand at the last word and he made a sort of grab at the letters stalked to the farthest window opened it and glanced over its contents sirwe beg to inform you that the suit carlyle vs carlyle is at an end the divorce was pronounced without opposition according to your request we hasten to forward you the earliest intimation of the fact we are sir faithfully yours moss grab f levison esq it was over then and all claim to the name of carlyle was declared to have been forfeited by the lady isabel forever captain levison folded up the letter and placed it securely in an inner pocket is there any news she asked news of the divorce i mean tush was the response of captain levison as if wishing to imply that the divorce was yet a faroff affair and he proceeded to open the other letter sirafter sending off our last dated today we received tidings of the demise of sir peter levison your granduncle he expired this afternoon in town where he had come for the benefit of medical advice we have much pleasure in congratulating you upon your accession to the title and estates and beg to state that should it not be convenient to you to visit england at present we will be happy to transact all necessary matters for you on your favoring us with instructions and we remain sir most faithfully yours moss grab sir francis levison bart the outside of the letter was superscribed as the other f levison esquire no doubt with a view to its more certain delivery at last thank the pigs was the gentlemans euphonious expression as he tossed the letter open on the breakfasttable the divorce is granted feverishly uttered lady isabel he made no reply but seated himself to breakfast may i read the letter is it for me to read for what else should i have thrown it there he said a few days ago you put a letter open on the table i thought for me but when i took it up you swore at me do you remember it captain levison you may drop that odious title isabel which has stuck to me too long i own a better now what one pray you can look and see lady isabel took up the letter and read it sir francis swallowed down his coffee and rang the table handbellthe only bell you generally meet with in france pierre answered it put me up a change of things said he in french i start for england in an hour it is very well pierre responded and departed to do it lady isabel waited till the man was gone and then spoke a faint flush of emotion in her cheeks you do not mean what you say you will not leave me yet i cannot do otherwise he answered theres a mountain of business to be attended to now that i am come into power moss grab say they will act for you had there been a necessity for your going they would not have offered that ay they do say sowith a nice eye to the feathering of their pockets besides i should not choose for the old mans funeral to take place without me then i must accompany you she urged i wish you would not talk nonsense isabel are you in a state to travel night and day neither would home be agreeable to you yet awhile she felt the force of the objections resuming after a moments pausewere you to go to england you might not be back in time in time for what oh how can you ask she rejoined in a sharp tone of reproach you know too well in time to make me your wife when the divorce shall appear i shall chance it coolly observed sir francis chance it chance the legitimacy of the child you must assure that before all things more terrible to me than all the rest would it be if now dont put yourself in a fever isabel how many times am i to be compelled to beg that of you it does no good is it my fault if i am called suddenly to england have you no pity for your child she urged in agitation nothing can repair the injury if you once suffer it to come upon him he will be a byword amidst men throughout his life you had better have written to the law lords to urge on the divorce he returned i cannot help the delay there has been no delay quite the contrary but it may be expected hourly now you are worrying yourself for nothing isabel i shall be back in time he quitted the room as he spoke and lady isabel remained in it the image of despair nearly an hour elapsed when she remembered the breakfast things and rang for them to be removed a maidservant entered to do it and she thought how ill miladi looked where is pierre miladi asked pierre was making himself ready to attend monsieur to england scarcely had she closed the door upon herself and the tray when sir francis levison appeared equipped for traveling goodbye isabel said he without further circumlocution or ceremony lady isabel excited beyond all selfcontrol slipped the bolt of the door and half leaning against it half leaning at his feet held up her hand in supplication francis have you any consideration left for meany in the world how can you be so alarmed isabel of course i have he continued in a peevish though kind tone as he took hold of her hands to raise her no not yet i will remain here until you say you will wait </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> wait another day or two you know that the french protestant minister is prepared to marry us the instant news of the divorce shall arrive if you do care still for me you will wait i cannot wait he replied his tone changing to one of determination it is useless to urge it he broke from her and left the room and in another minute had left the house pierre attending him a feeling amounting to a conviction rushed over the unhappy lady that she had seen him for the last time until it was too late she was right it was too late by weeks and months december came in the alps were covered with snow grenoble borrowed the shade and looked cold and white and sleety and sloppy the gutters running through the middle of certain of the streets were unusually black and the people crept along especially dismal close to the fire in the barn of a french bedroom full of windows and doors and draughts with its wide hearth and its wide chimney into which we could put four or five of our english ones shivered lady isabel vane she had an invalid cap on and a thick woolen invalid shawl and she shook and shivered perpetually though she had drawn so close to the wood fire that there was a danger of her petticoats igniting and the attendant had frequently to spring up and interpose between them and the crackling logs little did it seem to matter to lady isabel she sat in one position her countenance the picture of stony despair so had she sat so looking since she began to get better she had had a long illness terminating in a low fever but the attendants whispered among themselves that miladi would soon get about if she would only rouse herself she had got so far about as to sit up in the windy chamber and it seemed to be to her a matter of perfect indifference whether she ever got out of it this day she had partaken of her early dinnersuch as it was for her appetite failedand had dozed asleep in the arm chair when a noise arose from below like a carriage driving into the courtyard through the porte cochere it instantly aroused her had he come who is it she asked of the nurse miladi it is monsieur and pierre is with him i have begged milady often and often not to fret for monsieur would surely come miladi see i am right the girl departed closing the door and lady isabel sat looking at it schooling her patience another moment and it was flung open sir francis levison approached to greet her as he came in she waved him off begging him in a subdued quiet tone not to draw too near as any little excitement made her faint now he took a seat opposite to her and began pushing the logs together with his boot as he explained that he really could not get away from town before why did you come now she quietly rejoined why did i come repeated he are these all the thanks a fellow gets for travelling in this inclement weather i thought you would at least have been glad to welcome me isabel sir francis she rejoined speaking still with almost unnatural calmness as she continued to do throughout the interviewthough the frequent changes in her countenance and the movement of her hands when she laid them from time to time on her chest to keep down its beating told what effort the struggle cost hersir francis i am glad for one reason to welcome you we must come to an understanding one with the other and so far i am pleased that you are here it was my intention to have communicated with you by letter as soon as i found myself capable of the necessary exertion but your visit has removed the necessity i wish to deal with you quite unreservedly without concealment or deceit i must request you so to deal with me what do you mean by deal he asked settling the logs to his apparent satisfaction to speak and act let there be plain truth between us at this interview if there never has been before i dont understand you naked truth unglossed over she pursued bending her eyes determinately upon him it must be with all my heart returned sir francis it is you who have thrown out the challenge mind when you left in july you gave me a sacred promise to come back in time for our marriage you know what i mean when i say in time but of course i meant to do so when i gave the promise he interrupted but no sooner had i set my foot in london than i found myself overwhelmed with business and away from it i could not get even now i can only remain with you a couple of days for i must hasten back to town you are breaking faith already she said after hearing him calmly to the end your words are not words of truth but of deceit you did not intend to be back in time for the marriage or otherwise you would have caused it to take place ere you went at all what fancies you do take up uttered francis levison some time subsequent to your departure she quietly went on one of the maids was setting to rights the clothes in your dressingcloset and she brought me a letter she found in one of the pockets i saw by the date that it was one of those two which you received on the morning of your departure it contained the information that the divorce was pronounced she spoke so quietly so apparently without feeling or passion that sir francis was agreeably astonished he should have less trouble in throwing off the mask but he was an illtempered man and to hear that the letter had been found to have the falseness of his fine protestations and promises laid bare did not improve his temper now lady isabel continued it would have been better to have undeceived me then to have told me that the hopes i was cherishing for the sake of the unborn child were worse than vain i did not judge so he replied the excited state you then appeared to be in would have precluded your listening to any sort of reason her heart beat a little quicker but she stilled it you deem that it was not in reason that i should aspire to be the wife of sir francis levison he rose and began kicking at the logs with the heel of his boot this time well isabel you must be aware that it is an awful sacrifice for a man in my position to marry a divorced woman the hectic flushed into her thin cheeks but her voice sounded calm as before when i expected or wished for the sacrifice it was not for my own sake i told you so then but it was not made and the childs inheritance is that of sin and shame there he lies sir francis half turned to where she pointed and saw an infants cradle by the side of the bed he did not take the trouble to look at it i am the representative now of an ancient and respected baronetcy he resumed in a tone as of apology for his previous heartless words and to make you my wife would so offend all my family that stay interrupted lady isabel you need not trouble yourself to find needless excuses had you taken this journey for the purpose of making me your wife were you to propose to do so this day and bring a clergyman into the room to perform the ceremony it would be futile the injury to the child can never be repaired and for myself i cannot imagine any fate in life worse than being compelled to pass it with you if you have taken this aversion to me it cannot be helped he coldly said inwardly congratulating himself let us not doubt at being spared the work of trouble he had anticipated you made commotion enough once about me making you reparation she shook her head all the reparation in your power to makeall the reparation that the whole world can invent could not undo my sin it and the effects must lie upon me forever ohsin was the derisive exclamation you ladies should think of that beforehand yes she sadly answered may heaven help all to do so who may be tempted as i was if you mean that as a reproach to me its rather out of place chafed sir francis whose fits of illtemper were under no control and who never when in them cared what he said to outrage the feelings of another the temptation to sin as you call it lay not in my persuasions half so much as in your jealous anger toward your husband quite true was her reply and i believe you were on the wrong scent isabelif it will be any satisfaction to you to hear it since we are mutually on this complimentary discourse it is of no consequence to smooth over facts i do not understand what you would imply she said drawing her shawl round her with a fresh shiver how on the wrong scent with regard to your husband and that hare girl you were blindly outrageously jealous of him go on and i say i think you are on the wrong scent i do not believe mr carlyle ever thought of the girlin that way what do you mean she gasped they had a secret between themnot of lovea secret of business and those interviews they had together her dancing attendance upon him perpetually related to that and that alone her face was more flushed than it had been throughout the interview he spoke quietly now quite in an equal tone of reasoning it was his way when the illtemper was upon him and the calmer he spoke the more cutting were his words he need not have told her this what was the secret she inquired in a low tone nay i cant explain all they did not take me into their confidence they did not even take you better perhaps that they had though as things have turned out or seem to be turning theres some disreputable secret attaching to the hare family and carlyle was acting in it under the rose for mrs hare she could not seek out carlyle herself so she sent the young lady thats all i know how did you know it i had reason to think so what reason i must request you to tell me i overheard scraps of their conversation now and then in those meetings and so gathered my information you told a different tale to me sir francis was her remark as she turned her indignant eyes toward him sir francis laughed all stratagems are fair in love and war she dared not immediately trust herself to reply and a silence ensued sir francis broke it pointing with his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the cradle what have you named that young article there the name which ought to have been his by inheritancefrancis levison was her icy answer lets seehow old is he now he was born on the last day of august sir francis threw up his arms and stretched himself as if a fit of idleness had overtaken him then advanced to the cradle and pulled down the clothes who is he like isabel my handsome self were he like you in spirit i would pray that he might die ere he could speak or think she burst forth and then remembering the resolution marked out for herself subsided outwardly into calmness again what else retorted sir francis you know my disposition pretty well by this time isabel and may be sure that if you deal out small change to me you will get it back again with interest she made no reply sir francis put the clothes back over the sleeping child returned to the fire and </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> and stood a few moments with his back to it is my room prepared for me do you know he presently asked no it is not she quietly rejoined these apartments are mine now they have been transferred into my name and they can never again afford you accommodation will you be so obligingi am not strongas to hand me that writing case sir francis walked to the table she indicated which was at the far end of the great barn of a room and taking the writingcase from it gave it to her she reached her keys from the stand at her elbow unlocked the case and took from it some banknotes i received these from you a month ago she said they came by post and never had the grace to acknowledge them he returned in a sort of mock reproachful tone forty pounds that was the amount was it not i believe so allow me to return them to you count them return them to mefor what inquired sir francis in amazement i have no longer anything whatever to do with you in any way do not make my arm ache holding out these notes to you so long take them sir francis took the notes from her hand and placed them on a stand near to her if it be your wish that all relations should end between us why let it be so he said i must confess i think it may be the wisest course as things have come to this pass for a cat and dog life which would seemingly be ours is not agreeable remember though that it is your doing not mine but you cannot think i am going to see you starve isabel a sumwe will fix upon the amount amicablyshall be placed to your credit halfyearly and i beg of you to cease she passionately interrupted what do you take me for take you for why how can you live you have no fortuneyou must receive assistance from some one i will not receive it from you if the whole world denied me and i could find no help from strangers or means of earning my own bread and it was necessary that i should still exist i would apply to my husband for means rather than to you in saying this it ought to convince you that the topic may cease your husband sarcastically rejoined sir francis generous man a flush deep and painful dyed her cheeks i should have said my late husband you need not have reminded me of the mistake if you will accept nothing for yourself you must for the child he at any rate falls to my share i shall give you a few hundred a year with him she beat her hands before her as if beating off the man and his words not a farthing now or ever were you to attempt to send money to him i would throw it into the nearest river whom do you take me for what do you take me for she repeated rising in her bitter mortification if you have put me beyond the pale of the world i am still lord mount severns daughter you did as much toward putting yourself beyond its pale as dont i know it have i not said so she sharply interrupted and then she sat striving to calm herself clasping together her shaking hands well if you will persist in this perverse resolution i cannot mend it resumed sir francis in a little time you may probably wish to recall it in which case a line addressed to me at my bankers will lady isabel drew herself up put away those notes if you please she interrupted not allowing him to finish his sentence he took out his pocketbook and placed the bank notes within it your clothesthose you left here when you went to englandyou will have the goodness to order pierre to take away this afternoon and now sir francis i believe that is all we will part to remain mortal enemies from henceforth is that to be it to be strangers she replied correcting him i wish you a good day so you will not even shake hands with me isabel i would prefer not and thus they parted sir francis left the room but not immediately the house he went into a distant apartment and calling the servants before himthere were but twogave them each a years wages in advancethat they might not have to trouble miladi for money he said to them then he paid a visit to the landlord and handed him likewise a years rent in advance making the same remark after that he ordered dinner at a hotel and the same night he and pierre departed on their journey home again sir francis thanking his lucky star that he had so easily got rid of a vexatious annoyance and lady isabel she passed her evening alone sitting in the same place close to the fire and the sparks the attendant remonstrated that miladi was remaining up too late for her strength but miladi ordered her and her remonstrances into an adjoining room when lady isabel lay down to rest she sank into a somewhat calmer sleep than she had known of late also into a dream she thought she was back at east lynnenot back in one sense but that she seemed never to have gone away from itwalking in the flower garden with mr carlyle while the three children played on the lawn her arm was within her husbands and he was relating something to her what the news was she could not remember afterward excepting that it was connected with the office and old mr dill and that mr carlyle laughed when he told it they appeared to be interrupted by the crying of archibald and in turning to the lawn to ask what was the matter she awoke alas it was the actual crying of her own child which awoke herthis last childthe illfated little being in the cradle beside her but for a single instant she forgot recent events and doings she believed she was indeed in her happy home at east lynne a proud woman an honored wife as recollection flashed across her with its piercing stings she gave vent to a sharp cry of agony of unavailing despair </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxvi alone for evermore a surprise awaited lady isabel vane it was on a windy day in the following march that a traveller arrived at grenoble and inquired his way of a porter to the best hotel in the place his french being such as only an englishman can produce hotel lets see returned the man politely but with native indifference there are two hotels nearly contiguous to each other and monsieur would find himself comfortable at either there is the tross dauphins and there is the ambassadeurs monsieur chose haphazard the hotel des ambassadeurs and was conducted to it shortly after his arrival there he inquired his road to the place grenette and was offered to be shown but he preferred that it should be described to him and to go alone the place was found and he thence turned to the apartments of lady isabel vane lady isabel was sitting where you saw her the previous decemberin the precise spotcourting the warmth of the fire and it seemed courting the sparks also for they appeared as fond of her as formerly the marvel was how she had escaped spontaneous combustion but there she was yet and her clothes likewise you might think that but a night had passed when you looked at the room for it wore precisely the same aspect now as then everything was the same even to the childs cradle in the remote corner partially hidden by the bedcurtains and the sleeping child in it lady isabels progress toward recovery was remarkably lingering as is frequently the case when mind and body are both diseased she was so sitting when susanne entered the room and said that a monsieur anglais had arrived in the town to see her and was waiting below in the saloon lady isabel was startled an english gentlemanto see her english for certain was susannes answer for she had difficulty to comprehend his french who could be desirous to see her one out of the world and forgotten susanne she cried aloud a thought striking her it is never sir franit is not monsieur not in the least like monsieur complacently answered susanne it is a tall brave english gentleman proud and noble looking like a prince every pulse within lady isabels body throbbed rebelliously her heart bounded till it was like to burst her side and she turned sick with astonishment tall brave noble could that description apply to any but mr carlyle strange that so unnatural an idea should have occurred to her it would not have done so in a calmer moment she rose tottered across the chamber and prepared to descend susannes tongue was let loose at the proceeding was miladi out of her senses to attempt going downstairs would be a pretty ending for shed surely fall by the way miladi knew that the bottom step was of lead and that no head could pitch down upon that without ever never being a head any more except in the hospitals let miladi sit still in her place and shed bring the monsieur up what did it signify he was not a young petit maitre to quiz things he was fifty if he was a day his hair already turned to fine gray this set the question touching mr carlyle at rest and her heart stilled again the next moment she was inwardly laughing in her bitter mockery at her insensate folly mr carlyle come to see her her francis levison might be sending over some man of business regarding the money question was her next thought if so she should certainly refuse to see him go down to the gentleman and ask him his name susanne ask also from whence he came susanne disappeared and returned and the gentleman behind her whether she had invited him or whether he had chosen to come uninvited there he was lady isabel caught a glimpse and flung her hands over her burning cheeks of shame it was lord mount severn how did you find out where i was she gasped when some painful words had been uttered on both sides i went to sir francis levison and demanded your address certain recent events implied that he and you must have parted and i therefore deemed it time to inquire what he had done with you since last july she interrupted lifting up her wan face now colorless again do not think worse of me than i am he was here in december for an hours recriminating interview and we parted for life what have you heard of him lately not anything i never know what is passing in the world at home i have no newspaper no correspondence and he would scarcely be so bold as to write to me again i shall not shock you then by some tidings i bring you regarding him returned lord mount severn the greatest shock to me would be to hear that i should ever again be subjected to the sight of him she answered he is married heaven have pity on his poor wife was all the comment of lady isabel he has married alice challoner she lifted her head then in simple surprise alice not blanche the story runs that he has played blanche very false that he has been with her much during the last three or four months leading on her expectations and then suddenly proposed for her younger sister i know nothing of the details myself it is not likely and i heard nothing until one evening at the club i saw the announcement of the marriage for the following day at st georges i was at the church the next morning before he was not to stop it not to intercept the marriage breathlessly uttered the lady isabel certainly not i had no power to attempt anything of the sort i went to demand an answer </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> answer to my questionwhat he had done with you and where you were he gave me this address but said he knew nothing of your movements since december there was a long silence the earl appeared to be alternately ruminating and taking a survey of the room isabel sat with her head down why did you seek me out she presently broke forth i am not worth it i have brought enough disgrace upon your name and upon your husbands and upon your childrens he rejoined in the most severe manner for it was not in the nature of the earl of mount severn to gloss over guilt nevertheless it is incumbent upon me as your nearest blood relative to see after you now that you are alone again and to take care as far as i can that you do not lapse lower he might have spared her that stab but she scarcely understood him she looked at him wondering whether she did understand you have not a shilling in the world he resumed how do you propose to live i have some money yet when his money sharply and haughtily interposed the earl no she indignantly replied i am selling my trinkets before they are all gone i shall look out to get a living in some way by teaching probably trinkets repeated lord mount severn mr carlyle told me that you carried nothing away with you from east lynne nothing that he had given me these were mine before i married you have seen mr carlyle then she faltered seen him echoed the indignant earl when such a blow was dealt him by a member of my family could i do less than hasten to east lynne to tender my sympathies i went with another subject tooto discover what could have been the moving springs of your conduct for i protest when the black tidings reached me i believed that you must have gone mad you were one of the last whom i should have feared to trust but i learned nothing and carlyle was as ignorant as i how could you strike him such a blow lower and lower drooped her head brighter shone the shame on her hectic cheek an awful blow to mr carlyle it must have been she was feeling it in all its bitter intensity lord mount severn read her repentant looks isabel he said in a tone which had lost something of its harshness and it was the first time he had called her by her christian name i see that you are reaping the fruits tell me how it happened what demon prompted you to sell yourself to that bad man he is a bad man she exclaimed a base heartless man i warned you at the commencement of your married life to avoid him to shun all association with him not to admit him to your house his coming to east lynne was not my doing she whispered mr carlyle invited him i know he did invited him in his unsuspicious confidence believing his wife to be his wife a trustworthy woman of honor was the severe remark she did not reply she could not gainsay it she only sat with her meek face of shame and her eyelids drooping if ever a woman had a good husband in every sense of the word you had in carlyle if ever man loved his wife he loved you how could you so requite him she rolled in a confused manner the corners of her warm shawl over her unconscious fingers i read the note you left for your husband he showed it to me the only one i believe to whom he did show it it was to him entirely inexplicable it was so to me a notion had been suggested to him after your departure that his sister had somewhat marred your peace at east lynne and he blamed you much if it was so for not giving him your full confidence on the point that he might set matters on the right footing but it was impossible and there was the evidence in the note besides that the presence of miss carlyle at east lynne could be any excuse for your disgracing us all and ruining yourself do not let us speak of these things said lady isabel faintly it cannot redeem the past but i must speak of them i came to speak of them persisted the earl i could not do it as long as that man was here when these inexplicable things take place in the career of a woman it is a fathers duty to look into motives and causes and actions although the events in themselves may be as in this case irreparable your father is gone but i stand in his place there is no one else to stand in it her tears began to fall and she let them fallin silence the earl resumed but for that extraordinary letter i should have supposed you had been actuated by a mad infatuation for the cur levison its tenor gave the matter a different aspect to what did you allude when you asserted that your husband had driven you to it he knew she answered scarcely above her breath he did not know sternly replied the earl a more truthful honorable man than carlyle does not exist on the face of the earth when he told me then in his agony of grief that he was unable to form even a suspicion of your meaning i could have staked my earldom on his veracity i would stake it still i believed she began in a low nervous voice for she knew that there was no evading the questions of lord mount severn when he was resolute in their being answered and indeed she was too weak both in body and spirit to resisti believed that his love was no longer mine that he had deserted me for another the earl stared at her what can you mean by deserted he was with you there is a desertion of the heart was her murmured answer desertion of a fiddlestick retorted his lordship the interpretation we gave to the note i and carlyle was that you had been actuated by motives of jealousy had penned it in a jealous mood i put the question to carlyleas between man and mando you listen isabelwhether he had given you cause and he answered me as with god over us he had never given you cause he had been faithful to you in thought word and deed he had never so far as he could call to mind even looked upon another woman with covetous feelings since the hour that he made you his wife his whole thoughts had been of you and of you alone it is more than many a husband can say significantly coughed lord mount severn her pulses were beating wildly a powerful conviction that the words were true that her own blind jealousy had been utterly mistaken and unfounded was forcing its way to her brain after that i could only set your letter down as a subterfuge resumed the earla false barefaced plea put forth to conceal your real motives and i told carlyle so i inquired how it was he had never detected any secret understanding between you and thatthat beast located as the fellow was in the house he replied that no such suspicion had ever occurred to him he placed the most implicit confidence in you and would have trusted you with the creature around the world aye with any one else she entwined her hands one within the other pressing them to pain it would not deaden the pain at her heart carlyle told me he had been unusually occupied during the stay of that man besides his customary office work his time was taken up with some private business for a family in the neighborhood and he had repeatedly to see them more particularly the daughter after office hours very old acquaintances of his he said relatives of the carlyle family and he was as anxious about the secreta painful oneas they were this i observed to him may have rendered him unobservant to what was passing at home he told me i remember that on the very evening of thethe catastrophe he ought to have gone with you to a dinner party but most important circumstances arose in connection with the affair which obliged him to meet two gentlemen at his office and to receive them in secret unknown to his clerks did he mention the name of the family inquired lady isabel with white lips yes he did i forgot it though rabbit rabitsome such name as that was it hare that was ithare he said you appeared vexed that he did not accompany you to the dinner and seeing that he intended to go in afterward but was prevented when the interview was over in his office he was again detained at mrs hares house and by business as impossible to avoid as the other important business she echoed giving way for a moment to the bitterness of former feelings he was promenading in their garden by moonlight with barbaramiss hare i saw them as my carriage passed and you were jealous that he should be there exclaimed lord mount severn with mocking reproach as he detected her mood listen he whispered bending his head toward her while you may have thought as your present tone would seem to intimate that they were pacing there to enjoy each others society know that theycarlyle at any ratewas pacing the walk to keep guard one was within that housefor a short half hours interview with his poor motherone who lives in danger of the scaffold to which his own father would be the first to deliver him up they were keeping the path against that fathercarlyle and the young lady of all the nights in the previous seven years that one only saw the unhappy son at home for a half hours meeting with his mother and sister carlyle in the grief and excitement caused by your conduct confided so much to me when mentioning what kept him from the dinner party her face had become crimsoncrimson at her past lamentable folly and there was no redemption but he was always with barbara hare she murmured by way of some faint excuse i have mentioned so she had to see him upon this affair her mother could not for it was obliged to be kept from the father and so you construed business interviews into assignations continued lord mount severn with cutting derision i had given you credit for better sense but was this enough to hurl you on the step you took surely not you must have yielded in the persuasions of that wicked man it is all over now she wailed carlyle was true and faithful to you and to you alone few women have the chance of happiness in their married life in the degree that you had he is an upright and good man one of natures gentlemen one that england may be proud of as having grown upon her soil the more i see of him the greater becomes my admiration of him and of his thorough honor do you know what he did in the matter of the damages she shook her head he did not wish to proceed for damages or only for the trifling sum demanded by law but the jury feeling for his wrongs gave unprecedently heavy ones since the fellow came into his baronetcy they have been paid carlyle immediately handed them over to the county hospital he holds the apparently obsolete opinion that money cannot wipe out a wifes dishonor let us close those topics implored the poor invalid i acted wickedly and madly and have the consequences to bear forever more i cannot say where do you intend to fix your future residence inquired the earl i am unable to tell i shall leave this town as soon as i am well enough aye it cannot be pleasant for you to remain under the eyes of its inhabitants you were here with him were you not they think i am </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> am his wife she murmured the servants think it thats well so far how many servants have you two i am not strong enough yet to do much myself so am obliged to keep two she continued as if in apology for the extravagance under her reduced circumstances as soon as ever the baby can walk i shall manage to do with one the earl looked confounded the baby he uttered in a tone of astonishment and grief painful to her to hear isabel is there a child not less painful was her own emotion as she hid her face lord mount severn rose and paced the room with striding steps i did not know it i did not know it wicked heartless villain he ought to have married you before its birth was the divorce out previously he asked stopping short in his strides to put the question yes coward sneak may good men shun him from henceforth may his queen refuse to receive him you an earls daughter oh isabel how utterly you have lost yourself lady isabel started from her chair in a burst of hysterical sobs her hands extended beseechingly toward the earl spare me spare me you have been rending my heart ever since you came indeed i am too weak to bear it the earl in truth had been betrayed into showing more of his sentiments than he intended he recalled his recollection well well sit down again isabel he said putting her into her chair we shall go to the point i chiefly came here to settle what sum will it take you to live upon quietly as of course you would now wish to live but comfortably i will not accept anything she replied i will get my own living and the earls irascibility again arose at the speech he spoke in a sharp tone absurd isabel do not add romantic folly to your own mistakes get your own living indeed as much as is necessary for you to live upon i shall supply no remonstrance i tell you i am acting as for your father do you suppose he would have abandoned you to starve or to work the allusion touched every chord within her bosom and the tears fell fast i thought i could get my living by teaching she sobbed and how much did you anticipate the teaching would bring you in not very much she listlessly said a hundred a year perhaps i am very clever at music and singing that sum might keep us i fancy even if i only went out by the day and a fine keep it would be you shall have that sum every quarter no no no no i do not deserve it i could not accept it i have forfeited all claim to assistance not to mine now it is of no use to excite yourself my mind is made up i never willingly forego a duty and i look upon this not only as a duty but as an imperative one upon my return i shall immediately settle four hundred upon you and you can draw it quarterly then half that sum she reflected knowing how useless it was to contend with lord mount severn when he got upon the stilts of duty indeed two hundred a year will be ample it will seem like riches to me i have named the sum isabel and i shall not make it less a hundred pounds every three months shall be paid to you dating from this day this does not count said he laying down some notes on the table he took her hand within his in token of farewell turned and was gone and lady isabel remained in her chamber alone alone alone alone for evermore </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxvii barbaras misdoings a sunny afternoon in summer more correctly speaking it may be said a summers evening for the bright beams were already slanting athwart the substantial garden of mr justice hare and the tea hour seven was passing mr and mrs hare and barbara were seated at the meal somehow meals always did seem in process at justice hares if it was not breakfast it was luncheonif it was not luncheon it was dinnerif it was not dinner it was tea barbara sat in tears for the justice was giving her a piece of his mind and poor mrs hare deferently agreeing with her husband as she would have done had he proposed to set the house on fire and burn her up in it yet sympathizing with barbara moved uneasily in her chair you do it for the purpose you do it to anger me thundered the justice bringing down his hand on the teatable and causing the cups to rattle no i dont papa sobbed barbara then why do you do it barbara was silent no you cant answer you have nothing to urge what is the matter pray with major thorn come i will be answered i dont like him faltered barbara you do like him you are telling me an untruth you have liked him well enough whenever he has been here i like him as an acquaintance papa not as a husband not as a husband repeated the exasperated justice why bless my heart and body the girls going mad not as a husband who asked you to like him as a husband before he became such did ever you hear that it was necessary or expedient or becoming for a young lady to act on and begin to like a gentleman as her husband barbara felt a little bewildered heres the whole parish saying that barbara hare cant be married that nobody will have her on account ofofof that cursed stain left by i wont trust myself to name him i should go too far now dont you think thats a pretty disgrace a fine state of things but it is not true said barbara people do ask me but whats the use of their asking when you say no raved the justice is that the way to let the parish know that they ask you are an ungrateful rebellious selfwilled daughter and youll never be otherwise barbaras tears flowed freely the justice gave a dash at the bell handle to order the tea things carried away and after their removal the subject was renewed together with barbaras grief that was the worst of justice hare let him seize hold of a grievance it was not often he got upon a real one and he kept on at it like a blacksmith hammering at his forge in the midst of a stormy oration tongue and hands going together mr carlyle came in not much altered not much a year and threequarters had gone by and they had served to silver his hair upon the temples his manner too would never again be careless and light as it once had been he was the same keen man of business the same pleasant intelligent companion the generality of people saw no change in him barbara rose to escape no said justice hare planting himself between her and the door thats the way you like to get out of my reach when i am talking to you you wont go so sit down again ill tell you of your illconduct before mr carlyle and see if that will shame you barbara resumed her seat a rush of crimson dyeing her cheeks and mr carlyle looked inquiringly seeming to ask an explanation of her distress the justice continued after his own fashion you know carlyle that horrible blow that fell upon us that shameless disgrace well because the parish cant clack enough about the fact itself it must begin about barbara saying that the disgrace and humiliation are reflected upon her and that nobody will come near her to ask her to be his wife one would think rather than lie under the stigma and afford the parish room to talk shed marry the first man that came if it was the parish beadleanybody else would but now what are the facts youll stare when you know them she has received a bushel of good offersa bushel of them repeated the justice dashing his hand down on his knee and she says no to all the last was today from major thorn and my young lady takes and puts the stopper upon it as usual without reference to me or her mother without saying with your leave or by your leave she wants to be kept in her room for a week upon bread and water to bring her to her senses mr carlyle glanced at barbara she was sitting meekly under the infliction her wet eyelashes falling on her flushed cheeks and shading her eyes the justice was heated enough and had pushed his flaxen wig nearly hindpart before in the warmth of his argument what did you say to her snapped the justice matrimony may not have charms for barbara replied mr carlyle half jokingly nothing does have charms for her that ought to have growled justice hare shes one of the contrary ones by the way though hastily resumed the justice leaving the objectionable subject as another flashed across his memory they were coupling your name and matrimony together carlyle last night at the bucks head a very perceptible tinge of red rose to the face of mr carlyle telling of inward emotion but his voice and manner betrayed none indeed he carelessly said ah you are a sly one you are carlyle remember how sly you were over your first marriage justice hare was going to bring out but it suddenly occurred to him that all circumstances considered it was not precisely the topic to recall to mr carlyle so he stopped himself in the utterance coughed and went on again there you go over to see sir john dobede not to see sir john but paying court to miss dobede so the bucks head was amusing itself with that goodnaturedly observed mr carlyle well miss dobede is going to be married and i am drawing up the settlements its not she she marries young somerset everybody knows that its the other one louisa a nice girl carlyle very responded mr carlyle and it was all the answer he gave the justice tired of sitting indoors tired perhaps of extracting nothing satisfactory from mr carlyle rose shook himself set his wig aright before the chimneyglass and quitted the house on his customary evening visit to the bucks head barbara who watched him down the path saw that he encountered someone who happened to be passing the gate she could not at first distinguish who it might be nothing but an arm and shoulder cased in velveteen met her view but as their positions changed in conversationhis and her fathersshe saw that it was locksley he had been the chief witness not a vindictive one he could not help himself against her brother richard touching the murder of hallijohn meanwhile mrs hare had drawn mr carlyle into a chair close by her own archibald will you forgive me if i say a word upon the topic introduced by mr hare she said in a low tone as she shook his hand you know how fondly i have ever regarded you second only to my poor richard your welfare and happiness are precious to me i wish i could in any way promote them it occurs to me sometimes that you are not at present so happy as you might be i have some sources of happiness said mr carlyle my children and i have plenty of sources of interest what do you mean dear mrs hare your home might be made happier mr carlyle smiled nearly laughed cornelia takes care of that as she did in the old days you know yes i know would it not be as well to consider whether she would not be better in a home of her ownand for you to give east lynne another mistress he shook his head archibald it would be happier for you it would indeed it is only in new ties that you can forget the past you might find recompense yet for the sorrow you have gone through and i </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> i know none repeated mrs hare emphatically more calculated to bring it you than that sweet girl louisa dobede so long as mr carlyle was beginning and had not got so far in his sentence when he was interrupted by an exclamation from barbara what can be the matter with papa locksley must have said something to anger him he is coming in the greatest passion mamma his face crimson and his hands and arms working oh dear barbara was all poor mrs hares reply the justices great bursts of passion frightened her in he came closed the door and stood in the middle of the room looking alternately at mrs hare and barbara what is this cursed report thats being whispered in the place quoth he in a tone of suppressed rage but not unmixed with awe what report asked mr carlyle for the justice waited for an answer and mrs hare seemed unable to speak barbara took care to keep silence she had some misgivings that the justices words might be referring to herselfto the recent grievance a report that hehehas been here disguised as a laborer has dared to show himself in the place where hell come yet to the gibbet mrs hares face turned as white as death mr carlyle rose and dexterously contrived to stand before her so that it should not be seen barbara silently locked her hands one within the other and turned to the window of whom did you speak asked mr carlyle in a matteroffact tone as if he were putting the most matteroffact question he knew too well but he thought to temporize for the sake of mrs hare of whom do i speak uttered the exasperated justice nearly beside himself with passion of whom would i speak but the bastard dick who else in west lynne is likely to come to a felons death oh richard sobbed forth mrs hare as she sank back in her chair be merciful he is our own true son never a true son of the hares raved the justice a true son of wickedness and cowardice and blight and evil if he has dared to show his face at west lynne ill set the whole police of england upon his track that he may be brought here as he ought if he must come when locksley told me of it just now i raised my hand to knock him down so infamously false did i deem the report do you know anything of his having been here continued the justice to his wife in a pointed resolute tone how mrs hare would have extricated herself or what she would have answered cannot even be imagined but mr carlyle interposed you are frightening mrs hare sir dont you see that she knows nothing of itthat the very report of such a thing is alarming her into illness butallow me to inquire what it may be that locksley said i met him at the gate retorted justice hare turning his attention upon mr carlyle he was going by as i reached it oh justice i am glad i met you thats a nasty report in the place that richard has been here id see what i could do toward hushing it up sir if i were you for it may only serve to put the police in mind of by gone things which it may be better they should forget carlyle i went as i tell you to knock him down i asked him how he could have the hardihood to repeat such slander to my face he was on the high horse directly said the parish spoke the slander not he and i got out of him what it was he had heard and what was it interrupted mr carlyle more eagerly than he generally spoke why they say the fellow showed himself here some time ago a year or so disguised as a farm laborerconfounded fools not but what hed have been the fool had he done it to be sure he would repeated mr carlyle and he is not fool enough for that sir let west lynne talk mr hare but do not put faith in a word of its gossip i never do poor richard wherever he may be i wont have him pitied in my presence burst forth the justice poor richard indeed villain richard if you please i was about to observe that wherever he may bewhether in the backwoods of america or digging for gold in california or wandering about the united kingdomthere is little fear that he will quit his place of safety to dare the dangerous ground of west lynne had i been you sir i should have laughed at locksley and his words why does west lynne invent such lies ah theres the rub i dare say west lynne could not tell why if it were paid for doing it but it seems to have been a lame story it had got up this time if they must have concocted a report that richard had been seen at west lynne why put it back to a year agowhy not have fixed it for today or yesterday if i heard anything more i would treat it with the silence and contempt it deserves justice silence and contempt were not greatly in the justices line noise and explosion were more so but he had a high opinion of the judgment of mr carlyle and growling a sort of assent he once more set forth to pay his evening visit oh archibald uttered mrs hare when her husband was halfway down the path what a mercy that you were here i should inevitably have betrayed myself barbara turned round from the window but what could have possessed locksley to say what he did she exclaimed i have no doubt locksley spoke with a motive said mr carlyle he is not unfriendly to richard and thought probably that by telling mr hare of the report he might get it stopped the rumor had been mentioned to me barbara turned cold all over how can it have come to light she breathed i am at a loss to know said mr carlyle the person to mention it to me was tom herbert i say said he meeting me yesterday whats this row about dick hare what now i asked him why that dick was at west lynne some time back disguised as a farm laborer just the same you see that locksley said to mr hare i laughed at tom herbert continued mr carlyle turned his report into ridicule also before i had done with him will it be the means of causing richards detection murmured mrs hare from between her dry lips no no warmly responded mr carlyle had the report arisen immediately after he was really here it might not have been so pleasant but nearly two years have elapsed since the period be under no uneasiness dear mrs hare for rely upon it there is no cause but how could it have come out archibald she urged and at this distant period of time i assure you i am quite at a loss to imagine had anybody at west lynne seen and recognized richard they would have spoken of it at the time do not let it trouble you the rumor will die away mrs hare sighed deeply and left the room to proceed to her own chamber barbara and mr carlyle were alone oh that the real murderer could be discovered she aspirated clasping her hands to be subjected to these shocks of fear is dreadful mamma will not be herself for days to come i wish the right man could be found but it seems as far off as ever remarked mr carlyle barbara sat ruminating it seemed that she would say something to mr carlyle but a feeling caused her to hesitate when she did at length speak it was in a low timid voice you remember the description richard gave that last night of the person he had metthe true thorn yes did it strike you thenhas it ever occurred to you to thinkthat it accorded with some one in what way barbara he asked after a pause it accorded with the description richard always gave of the man thorn richard spoke of the peculiar movement of throwing off the hair from the foreheadin this way did that strike you as being familiar in connection with the white hand and the diamond ring many have a habit of pushing off their hairi think i do it myself sometimes barbara what do you mean have you a suspicion of any one have you she returned answering the question by asking another i have not since captain thorn was disposed of my suspicions have not pointed anywhere this sealed barbaras lips she had hers vague doubts bringing wonder more than anything else at times she had thought the same doubts might have occurred to mr carlyle she now found that they had not the terrible domestic calamity which had happened to mr carlyle the same night that richard protested he had seen thorn had prevented barbaras discussing the matter with him then and she had never done so since richard had never been further heard of and the affair had remained in abeyance i begin to despair of its ever being discovered she observed what will become of poor richard we can but wait and hope that time may bring forth its own elucidation continued mr carlyle ah sighed barbara but it is weary waitingweary weary how is it you contrive to get under the paternal displeasure he resumed in a gayer tone she blushed vividly and it was her only answer the major thorn alluded to by your papa is our old friend i presume barbara inclined her head he is a very pleasant man barbara many a young lady in west lynne would be proud to get him there was a pause barbara broke it but she did not look at mr carlyle as she spoke the other rumoris it a correct one what other rumor that you are to marry louisa dobede it is not i have no intention of marrying any one nay i will say it more strongly it is my intention not to marry any oneto remain as i am barbara lifted her eyes to his in the surprise of the moment you look amused barbara have you been lending your credence to the gossips who have so kindly disposed of me to louisa dobede not so but louisa dobede is a girl to be coveted and as mamma says it might be happier for you if you married again i thought you would be sure to do so no shewho was my wifelives what of that uttered barbara in simplicity he did not answer for a moment and when he did it was in a low almost imperceptible tone as he stood by the table at which barbara sat and looked down on her whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and before barbara could answer if indeed she had found any answer to make or had recovered her surprise he had taken his hat and was gone to return for a short while to lady isabel as the year advanced she grew stronger and in the latter part of the summer she made preparations for quitting grenoble where she would fix her residence or what she would do she knew not she was miserable and restless and cared little what became of her the remotest spot on earth one unpenetrated by the steps of civilized man appeared the most desirable for her where was she to find this she set out on her search she and the child and its nurse not susanne susanne had a sweetheart in grenoble and declined to leave it so a girl was engaged for the child in her place lady isabel wound up her housekeeping had her things packed and forwarded to paris there to wait her orders and finally quitted grenoble it was a fine day when she left itall too fine for the dark ending it was to bring when a railway accident does take place in france it is an accident </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> accident none of your milkandwater affairs where a few bruises and a great fright are the extent of the damages but too often a calamity whose remembrance lasts a lifetime lady isabel had travelled a considerable distance that first day and at the dusk of evening as they were approaching a place cammere where she purposed to halt for the night a dreadful accident occurred the details need not be given and will not be it is sufficient to say that some of the passengers were killed her child and nurse being amongst them and she herself was dangerously injured the injuries lay chiefly in her left leg and in her facethe lower part of her face the surgeons taking their cursory view of her as they did of the rest of the sufferers were not sparing in their remarks for they believed her to be insensible she had gathered that the leg was to be amputated and that she would probably die under the operationbut her turn to be attended to was not yet how she contrived to write she never knew but she got a pen and ink brought to her and did succeed in scrawling a letter to lord mount severn she told him that a sad accident had taken place she could not say how all was confusion and that her child and maid were killed she herself was dangerously injured and was about to undergo an operation which the doctors believed she could not survive only in case of her death would the letter be sent to lord mount severn she could not die she said without a word of thanks for all his kindness and she begged him when he saw mr carlyle to say that with her last breath she humbly implored his forgiveness and his childrens whom she no longer dared to call hers now this letter by the officiousness of a servant at the inn to which the sufferers were carried was taken at once to the post and after all things turned out not quite so bad as anticipated for when the doctors came to examine the state of lady isabel not cursorily they found there would be no absolute necessity for the operation contemplated fond as the french surgeons are of the knife to resort to it in this instance would have been cruel and they proceeded to other means of cure the letter was duly delivered at the town house of lord mount severn where it was addressed the countess was sojourning there for a few days she had quitted it after the season but some business or pleasure had called her again to town lord vane was with her but the earl was in scotland they were at breakfast she and her son when the letter was brought in eighteen pence to pay its scrawled address its foreign aspect its appearance altogether excited her curiosity in her own mind she believed she had dropped upon a nice little conjugal mares nest i shall open this cried she why it is addressed to papa exclaimed lord vane who possessed all his fathers notions of honor but such an odd letter it may require an immediate answer or is some begging petition perhaps get on with your breakfast lady mount severn opened the letter and with some difficulty spelt through its contents they shocked even her how dreadful she uttered in the impulse of the moment what is dreadful asked lord vane looking up from his breakfast lady isabelisabel vaneyou have not forgotten her forgotten her he echoed why mamma i must possess a funny memory to have forgotten her already she is dead she has been killed in a railway accident in france his large blue eyes honest and true as they had been in childhood filled and his face flushed he said nothing for emotion was strong within him but shocking as it is it is better for her went on the countess for poor creature what could her future life had been oh dont say it impetuously broke out the young viscount killed in a railway accident and for you to say that it is better for her so it is better said the countess dont go into heroics william you are quite old enough to know that she had brought misery upon herself and disgrace upon all connected with her no one could ever have taken notice of her again i would said the boy stoutly lady mount severn smiled derisively i would i never liked anybody in the world half so much as i liked isabel thats past and gone you would not have continued to like her after the disgrace she wrought somebody else wrought more of the disgrace than she did and had i been a man i would have shot him dead flashed the viscount you dont know anything about it dont i returned he not over dutifully but lady mount severn had not brought him up to be dutiful may i read the letter mamma he demanded after a pause if you can read it she replied tossing it to him it is written in the strangest style syllables divided and the words running one into the other she wrote it herself when she was dying lord vane took the letter to a window and stayed looking over it for some time the countess ate an egg and a plate of ham meanwhile presently he came back with it folded and laid in on the table you will forward it to papa today he observed i shall forward it to him but theres no hurry and i dont exactly know where your papa may be i shall send the notice of her death to the papers and i am glad to do it it is a blight removed from the family mamma i do think you are the unkindest woman that ever breathed ill give you something to call me unkind for if you dont mind retorted the countess her color rising dock you of your holiday and pack you back to school today a few mornings after this mr carlyle left east lynne and proceeded to his office as usual scarcely was he seated when mr dill entered and mr carlyle looked at him inquiringly for it was not mr carlyles custom to be intruded upon by any person until he had opened his letters then he would ring for mr dill the letters and the times newspaper lay on the table before him the old gentleman came up in a covert timid sort of way which made mr carlyle look all the more i beg pardon sir will you let me ask if you have heard any particular news yes i have heard it replied mr carlyle then sir i beg your pardon a thousand times over it occurred to me that you probably had not mr archibald and i thought i would have said a word to prepare you before you came upon it suddenly in the paper to prepare me echoed mr carlyle as old dill was turning away why what has come to you dill are you afraid my nerves are growing delicate or that i shall faint over the loss of a hundred pounds at the very most we shall not suffer above that extent old dill turned back again if i dont believe you are speaking of the failure of kent green its not that mr archibald they wont affect us much and therell be a dividend report runs what is it then then you have not heard it sir i am glad that im in time it might not be well for you to have seen it without a word of preparation mr archibald if you have not gone demented you will tell me what you mean dill and leave me to my letters cried mr carlyle wondering excessively at his sober matteroffact clerks words and manner old dill put his hands upon the times newspaper its here mr archibald in the column of deaths the first on the list please prepare yourself a little before you look at it he shuffled out quickly and mr carlyle as quickly unfolded the paper it was as old dill said the first on the list of deaths at cammere in france on the 18th inst isabel mary only child of william late earl of mount severn clients called mr carlyles bell did not ring an hour or two passed and old dill protested that mr carlyle was engaged until he could protest no longer he went in deprecatingly mr carlyle sat yet with the newspaper before him and the letters unopened at his elbow there are one or two who will come in mr archibaldwho will see you what am i to say mr carlyle stared at him for a moment as if his wits had been in the next world then he swept the newspaper from before him and was the calm collected man of business again as the news of lady isabels marriage had first come in the knowledge of lord mount severn through the newspapers so singular to say did the tidings of her death the next post brought him the letter which his wife had tardily forwarded but unlike lady mount severn he did not take her death as entirely upon trust he thought it possible the letter might have been dispatched without its having taken place and he deemed it incumbent on him to make inquiries he wrote immediately to the authorities of the town in the best french he could muster asking for particulars and whether she was really dead he received in due course a satisfactory answer satisfactory in so far as that it set his doubts at rest he had inquired after her by her proper name and title la dame isabelle vane and as the authorities could find none of the survivors owning that name they took it for granted she was dead they wrote him word that the child and nurse were killed on the spot two ladies occupying the same compartment of the carriage had since died one of whom was no doubt the mother and lady he inquired for she was dead and buried sufficient money having been found upon her person to defray the few necessary expenses thus through no premeditated intention of lady isabel news of her death went forth to lord mount severn and to the world her first intimation that she was regarded as dead was through a copy of that very days times seen by mr carlyleseen by lord mount severn an english traveller who had been amongst the sufferers and who received the english newspaper daily sometimes lent them to her to read she was not travelling under her own name she left that behind her when she left grenoble she had rendered her own too notorious to risk the chance recognition of travellers and the authorities little thought that the quiet unobtrusive madame vine slowly recovering at the inn was the dame isabella vane respecting whom the grand english comte wrote lady isabel understood it at once that the dispatching of her letter had been the foundation of the misapprehension and she began to ask herself now why she should undeceive lord mount severn and the world she longed none knew with what intense longings to be unknown obscure totally unrecognized by all none can know it till they have put a barrier between themselves and the world as she had done the child was gonehappy being she thought she could never be sufficiently thankful that it was released from the uncertain futuretherefore she had not his support to think of she had only herself and surely she could with ease earn enough for that or she could starve it mattered little which no there was no necessity for her continuing to accept the bounty of lord mount severn and she would let him and everybody else continue to believe that she was dead and be henceforth only madame vine a resolution she adhered to thus the unhappy isabels career was looked upon as run lord mount severn forwarded her letter to mr carlyle with the confirmation of her death which he had obtained from the french authorities it was a </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> a nine days wonder that poor erring lady isabel was deadpeople did not call her names in the very teeth of her fateand then it was over it was over lady isabel was as one forgotten </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxviii an unexpected visitor at east lynne there went sailing up the avenue to east lynne a lady one windy afternoon if not a lady she was attired as one a flounced dress and a stylish looking shawl and a white veil a very pretty woman tall and slender was she and she minced as she walked and coquetted with her head and altogether contrived to show that she had quite as much vanity as brains she went boldly up to the broad entrance of the house and boldly rang at it drawing her white veil over her face as she did so one of the menservants answered it not peter and seeing somebody very smart before him bowed deferentially miss hallijohn is residing here i believe is she within who maam miss hallijohn miss joyce hallijohn somewhat sharply repeated the lady as if impatient of any delay i wish to see her the man was rather taken aback he had deemed it a visitor to the house and was prepared to usher her to the drawingroom at least but it seemed it was only a visitor to joyce he showed her into a small parlor and went upstairs to the nursery where joyce was sitting with wilsonfor there had been no change in the domestic department of east lynne joyce remained as upper maid partially superintending the servants attending upon lucy and making miss carlyles dresses as usual wilson was nurse still miss joyce theres a lady asking for you said the man i have shown her into the gray parlor a lady for me repeated joyce who is it some one to see the children perhaps its for yourself i think she asked for miss hallijohn joyce looked at the man but she put down her work and proceeded to the gray parlor a pretty woman vain and dashing threw up her white veil at her entrance well joyce how are you joyce always pale turned paler still as she gazed in blank consternation was it really afy who stood before herafy the erring afy it was and she stood there holding out her hand to joyce with what wilson would have called all the brass in the world joyce could not reconcile her mind to link her own with it excuse me afy but i cannot take your hand i cannot welcome you here what could have induced you to come if you are going to be upon the high ropes it seems i might as well have stayed away was afys reply given in the pert but goodhumored manner she had ever used to joyce my hand wont damage yours i am not poison you are looked upon in the neighborhood as worse than poison afy returned joyce in a tone not of anger but of sorrow wheres richard hare afy tossed her head wheres who asked she richard hare my question was plain enough how should i know where he is its like your impudence to mention him to me why dont you ask me where old nick is and how he does id rather own acquaintance with him than with richard hare if id my choice between the two then you have left richard hare how long since i have leftwhat do you say broke off afy whose lips were quivering ominously with suppressed passion perhaps youll condescend to explain i dont understand when you left here did you not go after richard haredid you not join him ill tell you what it is joyce flashed afy her face indignant and her voice passionate i have put up with some things from you in my time but human nature has its limits of endurance and i wont bear that i have never set eyes on richard hare since that night of horror i wish i could id help to hang him joyce paused the belief that afy was with him had been long and deeply imbued within her it was the longcontinued and firm conviction of all west lynne and a settled belief such as that is not easily shaken was afy telling the truth she knew her propensity for making false assertions when they served to excuse herself afy she said at length let me understand you when you left this place was it not to share richard hares flight have you not been living with him no burst forth afy with kindling eyes living with himwith our fathers murderer shame upon you joyce hallijohn you must be precious wicked yourself to suppose it if i have judged you wrongly afy i sincerely beg your pardon not only myself but the whole of west lynne believed you were with him and the thought has caused me pain night and day what a cannibal minded set you all must be then was afys indignant rejoinder what have you been doing ever since then where have you been never mind i say repeated afy west lynne has not been so complimentary to me it appears that i need put myself out of my way to satisfy its curiosity i was knocking about a bit at first but i soon settled down as steady as old timeas steady as you are you married inquired joyce noting the word settled catch me marrying retorted afy i like my liberty too well not but what i might be induced to change my condition if anything out of the way eligible occurred it must be very eligible though to tempt me i am what i suppose you call yourselfa ladys maid indeed said joyce much relieved and are you comfortable afy are you in good service middling for that the pays not amiss but theres a great deal to do and lady mount severns too much of a tartar for me joyce looked at her in surprise what have you to do with lady mount severn well thats good its where i am at service at lady mount severns why not i have been there two years it is not a great deal longer i shall stop though she had too much vinegar in her for me but it poses me to imagine what on earth could have induced you to fancy i should go off with that dick hare she added for she could not forget the grievance look at the circumstances argued joyce you both disappeared but not together nearly together there were only a few days intervening and you had neither money nor friends you dont know what i had but i would rather have died of want on fathers grave than have shared his means continued afy growing passionate again where is he not hung or i should have heard of it he has never been seen since that night afy nor heard of nor heard of most people think he is in australia or some other foreign land the best place for him the more distance he puts between him and home the better if he does come back i hope hell get his dessertswhich is a ropes end id go to his hanging you are as bitter against him as mr justice hare he would bring his son back to suffer if he could a crossgrained old camel remarked afy in allusion to the qualities social and amiable of the revered justice i dont defend dick harei hate him too much for thatbut if his father had treated him differently dick might have been different well lets talk of something else the subject invariably gives me the shivers who is mistress here miss carlyle oh i might have guessed that is she as fierce as ever there is little alteration in her and there wont be on this side the grave i say joyce i dont want to encounter her she might set on at me like she has done many a time in the old days little love was there lost between me and corny carlyle is mr carlyle at home he will be home to dinner i dare say you would like some tea you shall come and take it with me and wilson in the nursery i was thinking you might have the grace to offer me something cried afy i intend to stop till tomorrow in the neighborhood my lady gave me two days holidayfor she was going to see her dreadful old grandmother where she cant take a maidand i thought id use it in coming to have a look at the old place again dont stare at me in that blank way as if you feared i should ask the grand loan of sleeping here i shall sleep at the mount severn arms i was not glancing at such a thought afy come and take your bonnet off is the nursery full of children there is only one child in it miss lucy and master william are with the governess wilson received afy with lofty condescension having richard hare in her thoughts but joyce explained that it was all a misapprehensionthat her sister had never been near richard hare but was as indignant against him as they were upon which wilson grew cordial and chatty rejoicing in the delightful recreation her tongue would enjoy that evening afys account of herself as to past proceedings was certainly not the most satisfactory in the world but altogether taken in the present it was so vast an improvement upon joyces conclusions that she had not felt so elated for many a day when mr carlyle returned home joyce sought him and acquainted him with what had happened that afy was come was maid to lady mount severn and above all that she had never been with richard hare ah you remember what i said joyce he remarked that i did not believe afy was with richard hare i have been telling her so sir to be sure when i informed her what people had believed continued joyce she nearly went into one of her old passions does she seem steady joyce i think so sirsteady for her i was thinking sir that as she appears to have turned out so respectable and is with lady mount severn you perhaps might see no objection to her sleeping here for tonight it would be better than for her to go to the inn as she talks of doing none at all replied mr carlyle let her remain later in the evening after mr carlyles dinner a message came that afy was to go to him accordingly she proceeded to his presence so afy you have returned to let west lynne know that you are alive sit down west lynne may go awalking for me in future sir for all the heed i shall take of it retorted afy a set of wickedminded scandalmongers to take and say i had gone after richard hare you should not have gone off at all afy well sir that was my business and i chose to go i could not stop in the cottage after that nights work there is a mystery attached to that nights work afy observed mr carlyle a mystery that i cannot fathom perhaps you can help me out what mystery sir returned afy mr carlyle leaned forward his arms on the table afy had taken a chair at the other end of it who was it that committed the murder he demanded in a grave and somewhat imperative tone afy stared some moments before she replied astonished at the question who committed the murder sir she uttered at length richard hare committed it everybody knows that did you see it done no replied afy if i had seen it the fright and horror would have killed me richard hare quarreled with my father and drew the gun upon him in passion you assume this to have been the case afy as others have assumed it i do not think that it was richard hare who killed your father not richard hare exclaimed afy after a pause then who do you think did it siri nonsense afy i know he did </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> did it proceeded afy it is true that i did not see it done but i know it for all that i know it sir you cannot know it afy i do know it sir i would not assert it to you if i did not if richard hare was here present before us and swore until he was black in the face that it was not him i could convict him by what means i had rather not say sir but you may believe me for i am speaking truth there was another friend of yours present that evening afy lieutenant thorn afys face turned crimson she was evidently surprised but mr carlyles speech and manner were authoritative and she saw it would be useless to attempt to trifle with him i know he was sir a young chap who used to ride over some evenings to see me he had nothing to do with what occurred where did he ride from he was stopping with some friends at swainson he was nobody sir what was his name questioned mr carlyle thorn said afy i mean his real name thorn was an assumed name oh dear no returned afy thorn was his name mr carlyle paused and looked at her afy i have reason to believe that thorn was only an assumed name now i have a motive for wishing to know his real one and you would very much oblige me by confiding it to me what was it i dont know that he had any other name sir i am sure he had no other persisted afy he was lieutenant thorn then and he was captain thorn afterward you have seen him since once in a way we have met where is he now now oh my goodness i dont know anything about him now muttered afy i have not heard of him or seen him for a long while i think i heard something about his going to india with his regiment what regiment is he in im sure i dont know about that said afy is not one regiment the same as another they are all in the army arent they sir afy i must find this captain thorn do you know anything of his family afy shook her head i dont think he had any i never heard him mention as much as a brother or a sister and you persist in saying his name was thorn i persist in saying it because it was his name i am positive it was his name afy shall i tell you why i want to find him i believe it was he who murdered your father not richard hare afys mouth and eyes gradually opened and her face turned hot and cold alternately then passion mastered her and she burst forth its a lie i beg your pardon sir but whoever told you that told you a lie thorn had no more to do with it than i had ill swear it i tell you afy i believe thorn to have been the man you were not present you cannot know who actually did it yes i can and do know said afy bursting into sobs of hysterical passion thorn was with me when it happened so it could not have been thorn it was that wicked richard hare sir have i not said that ill swear it thorn was with youat the moment of the murder repeated mr carlyle yes he was shrieked afy nearly beside herself with emotion whoever has been trying to put it off richard hare and on to him is a wicked falsehearted wretch it was richard hare and nobody else and i hope hell be hung for it yet you are telling me the truth afy gravely spoke mr carlyle truth echoed afy flinging up her hands would i tell a lie over my fathers death if thorn had done it would i screen him or shuffle it off to richard hare not so mr carlyle felt uncertain and bewildered that afy was sincere in what she said was but too apparent he spoke again but afy had risen from her chair to leave locksley was in the wood that evening otway bethel was in it could either of them have been the culprit no sir firmly retorted afy the culprit was richard hare and id say it with my latest breathid say it because i know itthough i dont choose to say how i know it time enough when he gets taken she quitted the room leaving mr carlyle in a state of puzzled bewilderment was he to believe afy or was he to believe the bygone assertion of richard hare </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxix a night invasion of east lynne in one of the comfortable sittingrooms of east lynne sat mr carlyle and his sister one inclement january night the contrast within and without was great the warm blazing fire the handsome carpet on which it flickered the exceedingly comfortable arrangement of the furniture of the room altogether and the light of the chandelier which fell on all presented a picture of home peace though it may not have deserved the name of luxury without heavy flakes of snow were falling thickly flakes as large and nearly as heavy as a crown piece rendering the atmosphere so dense and obscure that a man could not see a yard before him mr carlyle had driven home in the pony carriage and the snow had so settled upon him that lucy who happened to see him as he entered the hall screamed out laughingly that her papa had turned into a white man it was now later in the evening the children were in bed the governess was in her own sitting roomit was not often that miss carlyle invited her to theirs of an eveningand the house was quite mr carlyle was deep in the pages of one of the monthly periodicals and miss carlyle sat on the other side of the fire grumbling and grunting and sniffling and choking miss carlyle was one of your strongminded ladies who never condescended to be ill of course had she been attacked with scarlet fever or paralysis or st vitus dance she must have given in to the enemy but trifling ailments such as headache influenza sore throat which other people get passed her by imagine therefore her exasperation at finding her head stuffed up her chest sore and her voice going in short at having for once in her life caught a cold like ordinary mortals whats the time i wonder she exclaimed mr carlyle looked at his watch it is just nine cornelia then i think i shall go to bed ill have a basin of arrowroot or gruel or some slop of that sort after im in it im sure i have been free enough all my life from requiring such sick dishes do so said mr carlyle it may do you good theres one thing excellent for a cold in the head i know its to doubt your flannel petticoat crossways or any other large piece of flannel you may conveniently have at hand and put it on over your nightcap ill try it i would said mr carlyle smothering an irreverent laugh she sat on five minutes longer and then left wishing mr carlyle goodnight he resumed his reading but another page or two concluded the article upon which mr carlyle threw the book on the table rose and stretched himself as if tired of sitting he stirred the fire into a brighter blaze and stood on the hearthrug i wonder if it snows still he exclaimed to himself proceeding to the window one of those opening to the ground he threw aside the half of the warm crimson curtain it all looked dull and dark outside mr carlyle could see little what the weather was and he opened the window and stepped half out the snow was falling faster and thicker than ever not at that did mr carlyle start with surprise if not with a more unpleasant sensation but a feeling a mans hand touch his and at finding a mans face nearly in contact with his own let me come in mr carlyle for the love of life i see you are alone im dead beat and i dont know but im dodged also the tones struck familiarly on mr carlyles ear he drew back mechanically a thousand perplexing sensations overwhelming him and the man followed him into the rooma white man as lucy called her father aye for he had been hours and hours on foot in the snow his hat his clothes his eyebrows his large whiskers all were white lock the door sir were his first words need you be told that it was richard hare mr carlyle fastened the window drew the heavy curtains across and turned rapidly to lock the two doorsfor there were two to the room one of them leading into the adjoining one richard meanwhile took off his wet smockfrock of former memoryhis hat and his false black whiskers wiping the snow from the latter with his hand richard uttered mr carlyle i am thunderstruck i fear you have done wrong to come here i cut off from london at a moments notice replied richard who was literally shivering with the cold im dodged mr carlyle i am indeed the police are after me set on by that wretch thorn mr carlyle turned to the sideboard and poured out a wineglass of brandy drink it richard it will warm you id rather have it in some hot water sir but how am i to get the hot water brought in drink this for now why how you tremble ah a few hours outside in the cold snow is enough to make the strongest man tremble sir and it lies so deep in places that you have to come along at a snails pace but ill tell you about this business a fortnight ago i was at a cabstand at the west end talking to a cabdriver when some drops of rain came down a gentleman and lady were passing at the time but i had not paid any attention to them by jove i heard him exclaim to her i think were going to have pepper we had better take a cab my dear with that the man i was talking to swung open the door of his cab and she got insuch a fair young lady she was i turned to look at him and you might just have knocked me down with astonishment mr carlyle it was the man thorn indeed you thought i might be mistaken in him that moonlight night but there was no mistaking him in broad daylight i looked him full in the face and he looked at me he turned as white as cloth perhaps i didi dont know was he well dressed very oh theres no mistaking his position that he moves in the higher classes theres no doubt the cab drove away and i got up behind it the driver thought boys were there and turned his head and his whip but i made him a sign we didnt go much more than the length of a street i was on the pavement before thorn was and looked at him again and again he went white i marked the house thinking it was where he lived and why did you not give him into custody richard richard hare shook his head and my proofs of his guilt mr carlyle i could bring none against himno positive ones no i must wait till i can get proofs to do that he would turn round upon me now and swear my life away to murder well i thought id ascertain for certain what his name was and that night i went to the house and got into conversation with one of the servants who was standing at the door does captain thorn live here i asked him mr westleby lives here said he i dont know any captain thorn then thats his name thought i to myself a youngish man isnt he said i very smart with a pretty wife i dont know what you call </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> call youngish he laughed my masters turned sixty and his wifes as old that checked me perhaps he has sons i asked not any the man answered theres nobody but their two selves so with that i told him what i wantedthat a lady and gentleman had alighted there in a cab that day and i wished to know his name well mr carlyle i could get at nothing satisfactory the fellow said that a great many had called there that day for his master was just up from a long illness and people came to see him is that all richard all i wish it had been all i kept looking about for him in all the best streets i was half mad do you not wonder if he is in this position of life and resides in london that you have never dropped upon him previously interrupted mr carlyle no sir and ill tell you why i have been afraid to show myself in those latter parts of the town fearing i might meet with some one i used to know at home who would recognize me so i have kept mostly in obscure placesstables and such like i had gone up to the west end this day on a matter of business well go on with your story in a weeks time i came upon him again it was at night he was coming out of one of the theatres and i went up and stood before him what do you want fellow he asked i have seen you watching me before this i want to know your name i said thats enough for me at present he flew into a passion and swore that if ever he caught sight of me near him again he would hand me over into custody and remember men are not given into custody for watching others he significantly added i know you and if you have any regard for yourself youll keep out of my way he had got into a private carriage as he spoke and it drove away i could see that it had a great coatofarms upon it when do you say this was a week ago well i could not rest i was half mad i say and went about still trying if i could not discover his name and who he was i did come upon him but he was walking quickly arminarm withwith another gentleman again i saw him standing at the entrance to the betting rooms talking to the same gentleman and his face turned savagei believe with fear as much as angerwhen he discerned me he seemed to hesitate and thenas if he acted in a passionsuddenly beckoned to a policeman pointed me out and said something to him in a fast tone that frightened me and i slipped away two hours after when i was in quite a different part of the town in turning my head i saw the same policeman following me i bolted under the horses of a passing vehicle down some turnings and passages out into another street and up beside a cabman who was on his box driving a fare past i reached my lodgings in safety as i thought but happening to glance into the street there i saw the man again standing opposite and reconnoitering the house i had gone home hungry but this took all my hunger away from me i opened the box where i kept my disguise put it on and got out by a back way i have been pretty nearly ever since on my feet reaching here i only got a lift now and then but richard do you know that west lynne is the very worst place you could have flown to it has come to light that you were here before disguised as a farm laborer who the deuce betrayed that interrupted richard i am unable to tell i cannot even imagine the rumor was rife in the place and it reached your fathers ear the rumor may make peoples wits sharper to know you in your disguise than they otherwise might have been but what was i to do i was forced to come here first and get a little money i shall fix myself in some other big town far away from londonliverpool or manchester perhaps and see what employment i can get into but i must have something to live upon till i can get it i dont possess a penny piece he added drawing out his trousers pockets for the inspection of mr carlyle the last coppers i had three pence i spent in bread and cheese and half a pint of beer at midday i have been outside that window for more than an hour sir indeed and as i neared west lynne i began to think what i should do it was no use in me trying to catch barbaras attention such a night as this i had no money to pay for a lodging so i turned off here hoping i might by good luck drop upon you there was a little partition in the window curtainit had not been drawn closeand through it i could see you and miss carlyle i saw her leave the room i saw you come to the window and open it and then i spoke mr carlyle he added after a pause is this life to go on with me forever i am deeply sorry for you richard was the sympathizing answer i wish i could remedy it before another word was spoken the room door was tried and then gently knocked at mr carlyle placed his hand on richard who was looking scared out of his wits be still be at ease richard no one shall come in it is only peter not peters voice however but joyces was heard in response to mr carlyles demand of who was there miss carlyle has left her handkerchief downstairs sir and has sent me for it you cannot come ini am busy was the answer delivered in a clear and most decisive tone who was it quivered richard as joyce was heard going away it was joyce what is she here still has anything ever been heard of afy sir afy was here herself two or three months ago was she though uttered richard beguiled for an instant from the thought of his own danger what is she doing she is in service as a ladys maid richard i questioned afy about thorn she protested solemnly to me that it was not thorn who committed the deedthat it could not have been he for thorn was with her at the moment of its being done its not true fired richard it was thorn richard you cannot tell you did not see it done i know that no man could have rushed out in that frantic manner with those signs of guilt and fear about him unless he had been engaged in a bad deed was richard hares answer it could have been no one else afy declared he was with her repeated mr carlyle look here sir you are a sharp man and folks say i am not but i can see things and draw my reasoning as well as they can perhaps if thorn were not hallijohns murderer why should he be persecuting mewhat would he care about me and why should his face turn livid as it has done each time he has seen my eyes upon him whether he did commit the murder or whether he didnt he must know that i did not because he came upon me waiting as he was tearing from the cottage dicks reasoning was not bad another thing he resumed afy swore at the inquest that she was alone when the deed was done that she was alone at the back of the cottage and knew nothing about it till afterwards how could she have sworn she was alone if thorn was with her the fact has entirely escaped mr carlyles memory in his conversation with afy or he would not have failed to point out the discrepancy and to inquire how she could reconcile it yet her assertion to him had been most positive and solemn there were difficulties in the matter which he could not reconcile now that i have got over my passion for afy i can see her faults mr carlyle shed no more tell an untruth than i should stick a most awful thundering at the room doorloud enough to bring the very house down no officers of justice searching for a fugitive ever made a louder richard hare his face turned to chalk his eyes starting and his own light hair bristling up with horror struggled into his wet smockfrock after a fashion the tails up about his ears and the sleeves hanging forced on his hat and his false whiskers looked round in a bewildered manner for some cupboard or mousehole into which he might creep and seeing none rushed to the fireplace and placed his foot on the fender that he purposed an attempt at chimneyclimbing was evident though how the fire would have agreed with his pantaloons not to speak of what they contained poor dick appeared completely to ignore mr carlyle drew him back keeping his calm powerful hand upon his shoulder while certain sounds in an angry voice were jerked through the keyhole richard be a man put aside this weakness this fear have i not told you that harm shall not come near you in my house it may be that officer from london he may have brought half a dozen more with him gasped the unhappy richard i said they might have dodged me all the way here nonsense sit you down and be at rest it is only cornelia and she will be as anxious to shield you from danger as i can be is it cried the relieved richard cant you make her keep out he continued his teeth still chattering no that i cant if she has a mind to come in was the candid answer you remember what she was richard she is not altered knowing that to speak on this side the door to his sister when she was in one of her resolute moods would be of no use mr carlyle opened the door dexterously swung himself through it and shut it after him there she stood in a towering passion too it had struck miss carlyle while undressing that certain sounds as of talking proceeded from the room underneath which she had just quitted she possessed a remarkably keen sense of hearing did miss carlyle though indeed none of her faculties lacked the quality of keenness the servants joyce and peter excepted would not be convinced but that she must listen but in that they did her injustice first of all she believed her brother must be reading aloud to himself but she soon decided otherwise who on earth has he got in there with him quoth miss carlyle she rang her bell joyce answered it who is it that is with your master nobody maam but i say there is i can hear him talking i dont think anybody can be with him persisted joyce and the walls of this house are too well built maam for sounds from the down stairs rooms to penetrate here thats all you know about it cried miss carlyle when talking goes on in that room theres a certain sound given out which does penetrate here and which my ears have grown accustomed to go and see who it is i believe i left my handkerchief on the table you can bring it up joyce departed and miss carlyle proceeded to take off her things her dress first her silk petticoat next she had arrived as far as the flannel petticoat when joyce returned yes maam some one is talking with master i could not go in for the door was bolted and master called out that he was busy food for miss carlyle she feeling sure that no visitor had come to the house ran her thoughts rapidly over the members of the household and came to the conclusion that it must be the </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> the governess miss manning who had dared to closet herself with mr carlyle this unlucky governess was pretty and miss carlyle had been cautious to keep her and her prettiness very much out of her brothers sight she knew the attraction he would present to her visions or to those of any other unprovidedfor governess oh yes it was miss manning she had stolen in believing she miss carlyle was safe for the night but shed just unearth my lady and what in the world could possess archibaldto lock the door looking round for something warm to throw over her shoulders and catching up an article that looked as much like a green baize tablecover as anything else and throwing it on down stalked miss carlyle and in this trim mr carlyle beheld her when he came out the figure presented by miss carlyle to her brothers eyes was certainly ridiculous enough she gave him no time to comment upon it however but instantly and curtly asked who have you got in that room it is some one on business was his prompt reply cornelia you cannot go in she very nearly laughed not go in indeed it is much better that you should not pray go back you will make your cold worse standing here now i want to know whether you are not ashamed of yourself she deliberately pursued you a married man with children in your house id rather have believed anything downright wicked of myself than of you archibald mr carlyle stared considerably come ill have her out and out of this house she tramps tomorrow morning a couple of audacious ones to be in there with the door locked the moment you thought you had got rid of me stand aside i say archibald i will enter mr carlyle never felt more inclined to laugh and to miss carlyles exceeding discomposure she at this juncture saw the governess emerge from the gray parlor glance at the hall clock and retire again why shes there she uttered i thought she was with you miss manning locked in with me is that the mares nest cornelia i think your cold must have obscured your reason well i shall go in all the same i tell you archibald that i will see who is there if you persist in going in you must go but allow me to warn you that you will find tragedy in that room not comedy there is no woman in it but there is a man a man who came in through the window like a hunted stag a man upon whom a ban is set who fears the police are upon his track can you guess his name it was miss carlyles turn to stare now she opened her dry lips to speak but they closed again it is richard hare your kinsman theres not a roof in the wide world open to him this bitter night she said nothing a long pause of dismay and then she motioned to have the door opened you will not show yourselfinin that guise not show myself in this guise to richard harewhom i have whippedwhen he was a childten times a day stand on ceremony with him i dare say he looks no better than i do but its nothing short of madness archibald for him to come here he left her to enter telling her to lock the door as soon as she was inside and went himself into the adjoining room the one which by another door opened to the one richard was in then he rang the bell it was answered by a footman send peter to me lay supper here peter for two began mr carlyle when the old servant appeared a person is with me on business what have you in the house theres the spiced beef sir and there are some homemade raised pork pies that will do said mr carlyle put a quart of ale on the table and everything likely to be wanted and then the household can go to bed we may be late and the things can be removed in the morning ohand peternone of you must come near the room this or the next under any pretence whatever unless i ring for i shall be too busy to be disturbed very well sir shall i serve the ham also the ham i beg pardon sir i guessed it might be mr dill and he is so fond of our hams ah you were always a shrewd guesser peter smiled his master he is fond of ham i know yes you may put it on the table dont forget the small kettle the consequence of which little finesse on mr carlyles part was that peter announced in the kitchen that mr dill had arrived and supper was to be served for two but what a night for the old gentleman to have trudged through on foot exclaimed he and what a trudge hell have of it back again for itll be worse then chimed in one of the maids when mr carlyle got back in the other room his sister and richard hare had scarcely finished staring at each other please lock the door miss cornelia began poor shivering dick the doors locked snapped she but what on earth brought you here richard you must be worse than mad the bowstreet officers were after me in london he meekly responded unconsciously using a term which had been familiar to his boyish years i had to cut away without a thing belonging to me without so much as a clean shirt they must be polite officers not to have been after you before was the consolatory remark of miss carlyle are you going to dance a hornpipe through the streets of west lynne tomorrow and show yourself openly not if i can help it replied richard you might just as well do that if you come to west lynne at all for you cant be here now without being found out there was a bother about your having been here the last time i should like to know how it got abroad the life i lead is dreadful cried richard i might make up my mind to toil though thats hard after being reared a gentleman but to be an exile banned disgraced afraid to show my face in broad daylight amidst my fellowmen in dread every hour that the sword may fall i would almost as soon be dead as continue to live it well you have got nobody to grumble at you brought it upon yourself philosophically returned miss carlyle as she opened the door to admit her brother you would go hunting after that brazen hussy afy you know in defiance of all that could be said to you that would not have brought it upon me said richard it was through that fiends having killed hallijohn that was what brought the ban upon me its a most extraordinary thing if anybody else did kill him that the facts cant be brought to light retorted miss carlyle here you tell a cockandbull story of some mans having done it some thorn but nobody ever saw or heard of him at the time or since it looks like a madeup story mr dick to whiten yourself made up panted richard in agitation for it seemed cruel to him especially in his present frame of mind to have a doubt cast upon his tale it is thorn who is setting the officers upon me i have seen him three or four times within the last fortnight and why did you not turn the tables and set the officers upon him demanded miss carlyle because it would lead to no good wheres the proof save my bare word that he committed the murder miss carlyle rubbed her nose dick hare said she well you know you always were the greatest natural idiot that ever was let loose out of leading strings i know i always was told so and its what you always will be if i were accused of committing a crime which i knew another had committed and not myself should i be such an idiot as not to give that other into custody if i got the chance if you were not in such a cold shivery shaky state i would treat you to a bit of my mind you may rely upon that he was in league with afy at that period pursued richard a deceitful bad man and he carries it in his countenance and he must be in league with her still if she asserts that he was in her company at the moment the murder was committed mr carlyle says she does that she told him so the other day when she was here he never was and it was he and no other who did the murder yes burst forth miss carlyle for the topic was sure to agitate her that jezebel of brass did presume to come here she chose her time well and may thank her lucky stars i was not at home archibald hes a fool too quite as bad a you are dick hare in some thingsactually suffered her to lodge here for two days a vain illconducted hussy given to nothing but finery and folly afy said that she knew nothing of thorns movements now richard and had not for some time interposed mr carlyle allowing his sisters compliments to pass in silence she heard a rumor she thought that he had gone abroad with his regiment so much the better for her if she does know nothing of him sir was richards comment i can answer for it that he is not abroad but in england and where are you going to lodge tonight abruptly spoke miss carlyle confronting richard i dont know was the brokenspirited answer sighed forth if i lay myself down in a snowdrift and am found frozen in the morning it wont be of much moment was that what you thought of doing returned miss carlyle no he mildly said what i thought of doing was to ask mr carlyle for the loan of a few shillings and then i can get a bed i know a place where i shall be in safety two or three miles from here richard i would not turn a dog out to go two or three miles on such a night as this impulsively uttered mr carlyle you must stop here indeed i dont see how he is to get up to a bedroom or how a room is to be made ready for him for the matter of that without betraying his presence to the servants snapped miss carlyle and poor richard laid his aching head upon his hands but now miss carlyles manner was more in fault than her heart will it be believed that before speaking the above ungracious words before mr carlyle had touched upon the subject she had been casting about in her busy mind for the best plan of keeping richardhow it could be accomplished one thing is certain she resumed that it will be impossible for you to sleep here without its being known to joyce and i suppose you and joyce are upon the friendly terms of drawing daggers for she believes you were the murderer of her father let me disabuse her interrupted richard his pale lips working as he started up allow me to see her and convince her mr carlyle why did you not tell joyce better theres that small room at the back of mine said miss carlyle returning to the practical part of the subject he might sleep there but joyce must be taken in confidence joyce had better come in said mr carlyle i will say a word to her first he unlocked the door and quitted the room miss carlyle as jealously locked it again called to joyce and beckoned her into the adjoining apartment he knew that joyces belief in the guilt of richard hare was confirmed and strong but he must uproot that belief if richard was to be lodged in his house that night joyce he began you remember how thoroughly imbued with the persuasion you were that </highSuspense2> <highSuspense1> that afy went off with richard hare and was living with him i several times expressed my doubts upon the point the fact was i had positive information that she was not with him and never had been though i considered it expedient to keep my information to myself you are convinced now that she was not with him of course i am sir well you see joyce that my opinion would have been worth listening to now i am going to shake your belief upon another point and if i assure you that i have equally good grounds for doing so you will believe me i am quite certain sir that you would state nothing but what was true and i know that your judgment is sound was joyces answer then i must tell you that i do not believe it was richard hare who murdered your father sir uttered joyce amazed out of her senses i believe richard hare to be as innocent of the murder as you or i he deliberately repeated i have held grounds for this opinion joyce for many years then sir who did it afys other lover that dandy fellow thorn as i truly believe and you say you have grounds sir joyce asked after a pause good grounds and i tell you i have been in possession of them for years i should be glad for you to think as i do but sir if richard hare was innocent why did he run away ah why indeed it is that which has done the mischief his own weak cowardice was in fault he feared to come back and he felt that he could not remove the odium of circumstances joyce i should like you to see him and hear his story there is not much chance of that sir i dare say he will never venture here again he is here now joyce looked up considerably startled here in this house repeated mr carlyle he has taken shelter in it and for the few hours that he will remain we must extend our hospitality and protection to him concealing him in the best manner we can i thought it well that this confidence should be reposed in you joyce come now and see him considering that it was a subdued interviewthe voices subdued i meanit was a confused one richard talking vehemently joyce asking question after question miss carlyles tongue going as fast as theirs the only silent one was mr carlyle joyce could not refuse to believe protestations so solemn and her suspicions veered round upon captain thorn and now about the bed interjected miss carlyle impatiently wheres he to sleep joyce the only safe room that i know of will be the one through mine he cant sleep there maam dont you know that the key of the door was lost last week and we cannot open it so much the better hell be all the safer but how is he to get in to get in why through my room of course doesnt mine open to it stupid oh well maam if you would like him to go through yours thats different why shouldnt he go through do you suppose i mind young dick hare not i indeed she irascibly continued i only wish he was young enough for me to flog him as i used to thats all he deserves it as much as anybody ever did playing the fool as he has done in all ways i shall be in bed with the curtains drawn and his passing through wont harm me and my lying there wont harm him stand on ceremony with dick hare what next i wonder joyce made no reply to this energetic speech but at once retired to prepare the room for richard miss carlyle soon followed having made everything ready joyce returned the room is ready sir she whispered and all the household are in bed then nows your time richard goodnight he stole upstairs after joyce who piloted him through the room of miss carlyle nothing could be seen of that lady though something might be heard one given to truth more than politeness might have called it snoring joyce showed richard his chamber gave him the candle and closed the door upon him poor hunted richard goodnight to you </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxx barbaras heart at rest morning dawned the same dull weather the same heavy fall of snow miss carlyle took her breakfast in bed an indulgence she had not favored for ever so many years richard hare rose but remained in his chamber and joyce carried his breakfast in to him mr carlyle entered whilst he was taking it how did you sleep richard i slept well i was so dead tired what am i to do next mr carlyle the sooner i get away from here the better i cant feel safe you must not think of it before evening i am aware that you cannot remain here save for a few temporary hours as it would inevitably become known to the servants you say you think of going to liverpool or manchester to any large town they are all alike to me but one pursued as i am is safer in a large place than a small one i am inclined to think that this man thorn only made a show of threatening you richard if he be really the guilty party his policy must be to keep all in quietness the very worst thing that could happen for him would be your arrest then why molest me why send an officer to dodge me he did not like your molesting him and he thought he would probably frighten you after that day you would probably have seen no more of the officer you may depend upon one thing richard had the policemans object been to take you he would have done so not have contented himself with following you about from place to place besides when a detective officer is employed to watch a party he takes care not to allow himself to be seen now this man showed himself to you more than once yes theres a good deal in all that observed richard for to one in his class of life the bare suspicion of such a crime brought against him would crush him forever in the eyes of his compeers it is difficult to me richard to believe that he is in the class of life you speak of observed mr carlyle theres no doubt about it theres none indeed but that i did not much like to mention the name for it cant be a pleasant name to you i should have said last night who i have seen him walking with continued simplehearted richard mr carlyle looked inquiringly richard say on i have seen him sir with sir francis levison twice once he was talking to him at the door of the bettingrooms and once they were walking arminarm they are apparently upon intimate terms at this moment a loud flustering angry voice was heard calling from the stairs and richard leaped up as if he had been shot his doornot the one leading to the room of miss carlyleopened upon the corridor and the voice sounded close just as if its owner were coming in with a hound it was the voice of mr justice hare carlyle where are you heres a pretty thing happened come down mr carlyle for once in his life lost his calm equanimity and sprang to the door to keep it against invasion as eagerly as richard could have done he forgot that joyce had said the door was safely locked and the key mislaid as to richard he rushed on his hat and his black whiskers and hesitated between under the bed and inside the wardrobe dont agitate yourself richard whispered mr carlyle there is no real danger i will go and keep him safely but when mr carlyle got through his sisters bedroom he found that lady had taken the initiative and was leaning over the balustrades having been arrested in the process of dressing her clothes were on but her nightcap was not off little cared she however who saw her nightcap what on earth brings you up in this weather began she in a tone of exasperation i want to see carlyle nice news i have had what about anything concerning anne or her family anne be bothered replied the justice who was from some cause in a furious temper it concerns that precious rascal who i am forced to call son i am told he is here down the stairs leaped mr carlyle four at a time wound his arm within mr hares and led him to a sittingroom goodmorning justice you had courage to venture up through the snow what is the matter you seem excited excited raved the justice dancing about the room first on one leg then on the other like a cat upon hot bricks so you would be excited if your life were worried out as mine is over a wicked scamp of a son why cant folks trouble their heads about their own business and let my affairs alone a pity but what he was hung and the thing done with but what has happened questioned mr carlyle why this has happened retorted the justice throwing a letter on the table the post brought me this just nowand pleasant information it gives mr carlyle took up the note and read it it purported to be from a friend to justice hare informing that gentleman that his criminal son was likely to have arrived at west lynne or would arrive in the course of a day or so and it recommended mr hare to speed his departure from it lest he should be pounced upon this letter is anonymous exclaimed mr carlyle of course it is stamped the justice the only notice i should ever take of an anonymous letter would be to put it in the fire cried mr carlyle his lip curling with scorn but who has written it danced justice hare and is dick at west lynnethats the question now is it likely that he should come to west lynne remonstrated mr carlyle justice will you pardon me if i venture to give you my candid opinion the fool at west lynne running into the very jaws of death by jupiter if i can drop upon him ill retain him in custody and make out a warrant for his committal ill have this everlasting bother over i was going to give you my opinion quietly put in mr carlyle i fear justice you bring these annoyances upon yourself bring them upon myself ranted the indignant justice i did i murder hallijohn did i fly away from the law am i hiding beelzebub knows where do i take starts right into my native parish disguised as a laborer on purpose to worry my own father do i write anonymous letters bring them upon myself do i that cobs all carlyle you will not hear me out it is known that you are much exasperated against richard and if your son serves you the same when he is grown up shant you be exasperated pray fired justice hare do hear me it is known that you are much exasperated and that any allusion to him excites and annoys you now my opinion is justice that some busybody is raising these reports and writing these letters on purpose to annoy you it may be somebody at west lynne very near to us for all we know thats all rubbish peevishly responded the justice after a pause its not likely whod do it it is very likely but you may be sure they will not give us a clue as to the who i should put that letter in the fire and think no more about it thats the only way to serve them a pretty laugh they have had in their sleeve if it is anybody near at seeing you wade up here through the snow this morning they would know you were bringing the letter to consult me the justicein spite of his obstinacy he was somewhat easily persuaded to different </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> different views of things especially by mr carlylelet fall his coat tails which had been gathered in his arms as he stood with his back to the fire and brought down both his hands upon the table with force enough to break it if i thought that he spluttered if i could think it id have the whole parish of west lynne before me today and commit them for trial its a pity but what you could said mr carlyle well it may be or it may not be that that villain is coming here he resumed i shall call in at the police station and tell them to keep a sharp lookout you will do nothing of the sort justice exclaimed mr carlyle almost in agitation richard is not likely to make his appearance at west lynne but if he did would you his own father turn the flood upon him not a man living but would cry shame upon you i took an oath id do it said the justice you did not take an oath to go openmouthed to the police station upon the receipt of any despicable anonymous letter or any foolish report to say i have news that my son will be here today look after him nonsense justice let the police look out for themselves but dont you set them on the justice growled whether in assent or dissent did not appear and mr carlyle resumed have you shown this letter to mrs hare or mentioned it to her not i i didnt give myself time i had gone down to the front gate to see how deep the snow lay in the road when the postman came up so i read it as i stood there i went in for my coat and umbrella to come off to you and mrs hare wanted to know where i was going in such a hurry but i did not satisfy her i am truly glad to hear it said mr carlyle such information as this could not fail to have a dangerous effect upon mrs hare do not suffer a hint of it to escape you justice consider how much anxiety she has already suffered its partly her own fault why cant she drive the illdoing boy from her mind if she could said mr carlyle she would be acting against human nature there is one phase of the question which you may possibly not have glanced at justice you speak of delivering your son up to the law has it ever struck you that you would be delivering up at the same time your wifes life stuff said the justice you would find it no stuff so sure as richard gets brought to trial whether through your means or through any other so sure will it kill your wife mr hare took up the letter which had lain open on the table folded it and put it in its envelope i suppose you dont know the writing he asked of mr carlyle i never saw it before that i remember are you returning home no i shall go on to beauchamps and show him this and hear what he says its not much farther tell him not to speak of it then beauchamps safe for his sympathies are with richardoh yes they are justice ask him the question plainly if you like and he will confess to it i can tell you more sympathy goes with richard than is acknowledged to you but i would not show that letter to anyone else than beauchamp added mr carlyle neither would i speak of it who can have written it repeated the justice it bears you see the london postmark it is too wide a speculation to enter upon and no satisfactory conclusion could come of it justice hare departed mr carlyle watched him down the avenue striding under his umbrella and then went up to richard miss carlyle was sitting with the latter then i thought i should have died spoke poor dick i declare mr carlyle my very blood seemed turned to water and i thought i should have died with fright is he gone awayis all safe he is gone and its all safe and what did he want what was it he had heard about me mr carlyle gave a brief explanation and richard immediately set down the letter as the work of thorn will it be possible for me to see my mother this time he demanded of mr carlyle i think it would be highly injudicious to let your mother know you are here or have been here was the answer of mr carlyle she would naturally be inquiring into particulars and when she came to hear that you were pursued she would never have another minutes peace you must forego the pleasure of seeing her this time richard and barbara barbara might come and stay the day with you only only what sir cried richard for mr carlyle had hesitated i was thinking what a wretched morning it is for her to come out in she would go through an avalancheshed wade through mountains of snow to see me cried richard eagerly and be delighted to do it she always was a little fool put in miss carlyle jerking some stitches out of her knitting i know she would observed mr carlyle in answer to richard we will try and get her here she can arrange about the money i am to have just as well as my mother could you know sir yes for barbara is in receipt of money of her own now and i know she would not wish better than to apply some of it to you cornelia as an excuse for getting her here i must say to mrs hare that you are ill and wish barbara to come for the day and bear your company shall i say i am dead if you like responded miss corny who was in one of her cross moods mr carlyle ordered the pony carriage and drove forth with john he drew in at the grove barbara and mrs hare were seated together and looked surprised at the early visit do you want mr hare archibald he is out he went while the breakfast was on the table apparently in a desperate hurry i dont want mr hare i want barbara i have come to carry her off to carry off barbara echoed mrs hare cornelia is not well she had caught a violent cold and wishes barbara to spend the day with her oh mr carlyle i cannot leave mamma today she is not well herself and she would be dull without me neither can i spare her archibald it is not a day for barbara to go out how could he get to say a word to barbara alone whilst he deliberated talking on though all the while to mrs hare a servant appeared at the sittingroom door the fishmongers boy is come up maam his master has sent him to say that he fears therell be no fish in today in anything like time the trains wont get up with this weather mrs hare rose from her seat to hold a confab at the door with the maid and mr carlyle seized his opportunity barbara he whispered make no opposition you must come what i really want you for is connected with richard she looked up at him a startled glance and the crimson flew to her face mrs hare returned to her seat oh such a day she shivered i am sure cornelia cannot expect barbara but cornelia does and there is my pony carriage waiting to take her before i go to the office not a flake of snow can come near her mrs hare the large warm apron will be up and an umbrella shield her bonnet and face get your things on barbara mamma if you would not very much mind being left i should like to go said barbara with almost trembling eagerness but you would be sure to take cold child oh dear no i can wrap up well and i will see that she comes home all right this evening added mr carlyle in a few minutes they were seated in the pony carriage barbaras tongue was burning to ask questions but john sat behind them and would have overheard when they arrived at east lynne mr carlyle gave her his arm up the steps and took her into the breakfastroom will you prepare yourself for a surprise barbara suspensefearhad turned her very pale something that has happened to richard she uttered nothing that need agitate you he is here here where here under this roof he slept here last night oh archibald only fancy barbara i opened the window at nine last night to look at the weather and in burst richard we could not let him go out again in the snow so he slept here in that room next cornelias does she know of it of course and joyce also we were obliged to tell joyce it is he you have come to spend the day with but just imagine richards fear your father came this morning calling up the stairs after me saying he heard richard was here i thought richard would have gone out of his mind with fright a few more explanations and mr carlyle took barbara into the room miss carlyle and her knitting still keeping richard company in fact that was to be the general sitting room of the day and a hot lunch richards dinner would be served to miss carlyles chamber at one oclock joyce only admitted to wait on her and now i must go said mr carlyle after chatting a few minutes the office is waiting for me and my poor ponies are in the snow but youll be sure to be home early mr carlyle said richard i dare not stop here i must be off not a moment later than six or seven oclock i will be home richard anxiously did richard and barbara consult that day miss carlyle of course putting in her word over and over again did barbara ask the particulars of the slight interviews richard had had with thorn over and over again did she openly speculate upon what his name really was if you could but discover some one whom he knows and inquire it she exclaimed i have seen him with one person but i cant inquire of him they are too thick together he and thorn and are birds of a feather also i suspect great swells both oh richard dont use those expressions they are unsuited to a gentleman richard laughed bitterly a gentleman who is it you have seen thorn with inquired barbara sir francis levison replied richard glancing at miss carlyle who drew in her lips ominously with whom uttered barbara betraying complete astonishment do you know sir francis levison oh yes i know him nearly the only man about town that i do know barbara seemed lost in a puzzled reverie and it was some time before she aroused herself from it are they at all alike she asked very much so i suspect both bad men but i meant in person not in the least except that they are both tall again barbara sank into thought richards words had surprised her she was aroused by it from hearing a childs voice in the next room she ran into it and miss carlyle immediately fastened the intervening door it was little archibald carlyle joyce had come in with the tray to lay the luncheon and before she could lock the door archibald ran in after her barbara lifted him in her arms to carry him back to the nursery oh you heavy boy she exclaimed archie laughed wilson says that he lisped if ever she has to carry me i have brought you a truant wilson cried barbara oh is it you miss barbara how are you miss naughty boyyes he ran away without my noticing himhe is got now so that he can open the door you must be so kind as to keep him strictly in for today concluded miss barbara authoritatively miss carlyle is not </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> not well and cannot be subjected to the annoyance of his running into the room evening came and the time of richards departure it was again snowing heavily though it had ceased in the middle of the day money for the present had been given to him arrangements had been discussed mr carlyle insisted upon richards sending him his address as soon as he should own one to send and richard faithfully promised he was in very low spirits almost as low as barbara who could not conceal her tears they dropped in silence on her pretty silk dress he was smuggled down the stairs a large cloak of miss carlyles enveloping him into the room he had entered by storm the previous night mr carlyle held the window open goodbye barbara dear if ever you should be able to tell my mother of this day say that my chief sorrow was not to see her oh richard she sobbed forth brokenhearted goodbye may god be with you and bless you farewell richard said miss carlyle dont you be fool enough to get into any more scrapes last of all he rung the hand of mr carlyle the latter went outside with him for an instant and their leavetaking was alone barbara returned to the chamber he had quitted she felt that she must indulge in a few moments sobbing joyce was there but barbara was sobbing when she entered it it is hard for him miss barbara if he is really innocent barbara turned her streaming eyes upon her if joyce do you doubt that he is innocent i quite believe him to be so now miss nobody could so solemnly assert what was not true the thing at present will be to find that captain thorn joyce exclaimed barbara in excitement seizing hold of joyces hands i thought i had found him i believed in my own mind that i knew who he was i dont mind telling you though i have never before spoken of it and with one thing or other this night i feel just as if i should dieas if i must speak i thought it was sir francis levison joyce stared with all her eyes miss barbara i did i have thought it ever since the night that lady isabel went away my poor brother was at west lynne thenhe had come for a few hours and he met the man thorn walking in bean lane he was in evening dress and richard described a peculiar motion of histhe throwing off of his hair from his brow he said his white hand and his diamond ring glittered in the moonlight the white hand the ring the motionfor he was always doing itall reminded me of captain levison and from that hour until today i believed him to be the man richard saw today richard tells me that he knows sir francis levison and that he and thorn are intimate what i think now is that this thorn must have paid a flying visit to the neighborhood that night to assist captain levison in the wicked work that he had on hand how strange it all sounds uttered joyce and i never could tell my suspicions to mr carlyle i did not like to mention francis levisons name to him barbara soon returned down stairs i must be going home she said to mr carlyle it is turned halfpast seven and mamma will be uneasy whenever you like barbara but can i not walk i am sorry to take out your ponies again and in this storm mr carlyle laughed which would feel the storm the worst you or the ponies but when barbara got outside she saw that it was not the pony carriage but the chariot that was in waiting for her she turned inquiringly to mr carlyle did you think i should allow you to go home in an open carriage tonight barbara are you coming also i suppose i had better he smiled to see that you and the carriage do not get fixed in a rut barbara withdrew to her corner of the chariot and cried silently very very deeply did she mourn the unhappy situationthe privations of her brother and she knew that he was one to feel them deeply he could not battle with the worlds hardships so bravely as many could mr carlyle only detected her emotion as they were nearing the grove he leaned forward took her hand and held it between his dont grieve barbara bright days may be in store for us yet the carriage stopped you may go back he said to the servants when he alighted i shall walk home oh exclaimed barbara i do think you intend to spend the evening with us mamma will be so pleased her voice sounded as if she was also mr carlyle drew her hand within his arm as they walked up the path but barbara had reckoned without her host mrs hare was in bed consequently could not be pleased at the visit of mr carlyle the justice had gone out and she feeling tired and not well thought she would retire to rest barbara stole into her room but found her asleep so that it fell to barbara to entertain mr carlyle they stood together before the large pierglass in front of the blazing fire barbara was thinking over the events of the day what mr carlyle was thinking of was best known to himself his eyes covered with their drooping eyelids were cast upon barbara there was a long silence at length barbara seemed to feel that his gaze was upon her and she looked up at him will you marry me barbara the words were spoken in the quietest most matteroffact tone just as if he had said shall i give you a chair barbara but oh the change that passed over her countenance the sudden light of joy the scarlet flush of emotion and happiness then it all faded down to paleness and sadness she shook her head in the negative but you are very kind to ask me she added in words what is the impediment barbara another rush of color as before and a deep silence mr carlyle stole his arm around her and bent his face on a level with hers whisper it to me barbara she burst into a flood of tears is it because i once married another no no it is the remembrance of that nightyou cannot have forgotten it and it is stamped on my brain in letters of fire i never thought so to betray myself but for what passed that night you would not have asked me now barbara she glanced up at him the tone was so painful do you know that i love you that there is none other in the whole world whom i would care to marry but you nay barbara when happiness is within our reach let us not throw it away upon a chimera she cried more softly leaning upon his arm happiness would it be happiness for you great and deep happiness he whispered she read truth in his countenance and a sweet smile illumined her sunny features mr carlyle read its signs you love me as much as ever barbara far more far more was the murmured answer and mr carlyle held her closer and drew her face fondly to his barbaras heart was at length at rest and she had been content to remain where she was forever and richard had he got clear off richard was stealing along the road plunging into the snow by the hedge because it was more sheltered there than in the beaten path when his umbrella came in contact with another umbrella miss carlyle had furnished it to him not to protect his battered hat but to protect his face from being seen by the passers by the umbrella he encountered was an aristocratic silk one with an ivory handle dicks was of democratic cotton with hardly any handle at all and the respective owners had been bearing on heads down and umbrellas out till they the umbrellas met smash right under a gas lamp aside went the umbrellas and the antagonists stared at each other how dare you fellow cant you see where you are going on dick thought he should have dropped he would have given all the money his pockets held if the friendly earth had but opened and swallowed him in for he was now peering into the face of his own father uttering an exclamation of dismay which broke from him involuntarily richard sped away with the swiftness of an arrow did justice hare recognize the tones it cannot be said he saw a rough strange looking man with bushy black whiskers who was evidently scared at the sight of him that was nothing for the justice being a justice and a strict one was regarded with considerable awe in the parish by those of dicks apparent caliber nevertheless he stood still and gazed in the direction until all sound of richards footsteps had died away in the distance tears were streaming down the face of mrs hare it was a bright morning after the snowstorm so bright that the sky was blue and the sun was shining but the snow lay deeply upon ground mrs hare sat in her chair enjoying the brightness and mr carlyle stood near her the tears were of joy and of grief mingledof grief at hearing that she should at last have to part with barbara of joy that she was going to one so entirely worthy of her as mr carlyle archibald she has had a happy home here you will render yours as much so to the very utmost of my power you will be ever kind to her and cherish her with my whole strength and heart dear mrs hare i thought you knew me too well to doubt me doubt you i do not doubt you i trust you implicitly archibald had the whole world laid themselves at barbaras feet i should have prayed that she might choose you a small smile flitted over mr carlyles lips he knew it was what barbara would have done but archibald what about cornelia returned mrs hare i would not for a moment interfere in your affairs or in the arrangements you and barbara may agree upon but i cannot help thinking that married people are better alone cornelia will quit east lynne said mr carlyle i have not spoken to her yet but i shall do so now i have long made my mind up that if ever i did marry again i and my wife would live alone it is said she interfered too much with my former wife had i suspected it cornelia should not have remained in the house a day rest assured that barbara shall not be an object to the chance how did you come over her demanded the justice who had already given his gratified consent and who now entered in his dressing gown and morning wig others have tried it on and barbara would not listen to them i suppose i must have cast a spell upon her answered mr carlyle breaking into a smile here she is barbara carried on the unceremonious justice what is it that you see in carlyle more than anybody else barbaras scarlet cheeks answered for her papa she said otway bethel is at the door asking to speak to you jasper says he wont come in then im sure im not going out to him in the cold here mr otway what are you afraid of he called out come in otway bethel made his appearance in his usual sporting costume but he did not seem altogether at his ease in the presence of mrs hare and barbara the colonel wished to see you justice and ask you if you had any objection to the meetings being put off from one oclock till two cried he after nodding to mr carlyle he has got a friend coming to see him unexpectedly who will leave again by the two oclock train i dont care which it is answered mr hare two oclock will do as well </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> well as one for me thats all right then and ill drop in upon herbert and pinner and acquaint them miss carlyles cold was better that evening in fact she seemed quite herself again and mr carlyle introduced the subject of his marriage it was after dinner that he began upon it cornelia when i married lady isabel vane you reproached me severely with having kept you in the dark if you had not kept me in the dark but consulted me as any other christian would the course of events would have been wholly changed and the wretchedness and disgrace that fell on this house been spared to it fiercely interrupted miss carlyle we will leave the past he said and consider the future i was about to remark that i do not intend to fall under your displeasure again for the like offense i believe you have never wholly forgiven it and never shall cried she impetuously i did not deserve the slight therefore almost as soon as i know it myself i acquaint you i am about to marry a second time cornelia miss carlyle started up her spectacles dropped off her nose and a knittingbox which she happened to have on her knees clattered to the floor what did you say she uttered aghast im about to marry you i is there anything so very astonishing in it for the love of common sense dont go and make such a fool of yourself you have done it once was not that enough for you but you must run your head into the noose again now cornelia can you wonder that i do not speak of things when you meet them in this way you treat me just as you did when i was a child it is very foolish when folk act childishly they must be treated as children i always thought you were mad when you married before but i shall think you doubly mad now because you have preferred to remain single and solitary yourself is it any reason why you should condemn me to do the same you are happy alone i should be happier with a wife that she may go and disgrace you as the last one did intemperately spoke miss carlyle caring not a rush what she said in her storm of anger mr carlyles brow flushed but he controlled his temper no he calmly replied i am not afraid of that in the one i have now chosen miss corny gathered her knitting together he had picked up her box her hands trembled and the lines of her face were working it was a blow to her as keen as the other had been pray who is it that you have chosen she jerked forth the whole neighborhood has been after you let it be who it will cornelia you will be sure to grumble were i to say that it was a royal princess or a peasants daughter you would equally see grounds for finding fault of course i should i know who it isthat stuckup louisa dobede no it is not i never had the slightest intention of choosing louisa dobede nor she of choosing me i am marrying to please myself and for a wife louisa dobede would not please me as you did before sarcastically put in miss corny yes as i did before well cant you open your mouth and say who it is was the exasperated rejoinder it is barbara hare who shrieked miss carlyle you are not deaf cornelia well you are an idiot she exclaimed lifting up her hands and eyes thank you he said but without any signs of irritation and so you are you are archibald to suffer that girl who has been angling after you so long to catch you at last she has not angled after me had she done so she would probably never have been mrs carlyle whatever passing fancy she may have entertained for me in earlier days she has shown no symptoms of it of late years and i am quite certain that she had no more thought or idea that i should choose her for my second wife than you had i should choose you others have angled after me too palpably but barbara has not she is a conceited minx as vain as she is high what else have you to urge against her i would have married a girl without a slur if i must have married aggravatingly returned miss corny slur slur yes dear me is it an honorthe possessing a brother such as richard miss corny sniffed pigs may fly but i never saw them try at it the next consideration cornelia is about your residence you will go back i presume to your own home miss corny did not believe her own ears go back to my own home she exclaimed i shall do nothing of the sort i shall stop at east lynne whats to hinder me mr carlyle shook his head it cannot be he said in a low decisive tone who says so she sharply asked i do have you forgotten that nightwhen she went awaythe words spoken by joyce cornelia whether they were true or false i will not subject another to the chance she did not answer her lips parted and closed again somehow miss carlyle could not bear to be reminded of that revelation of joyces it subdued even her i cast no reflection upon you hastily continued mr carlyle you have been a mistress of a house for many years and you naturally look to be so it is right you should but two mistresses in a house do not answer cornelia they never did and they never will why did you not give me so much of your sentiments when i first came to east lynne she burst forth i hate hypocrisy they were not my sentiments then i possessed none i was ignorant upon the subject as i was upon many others experience has come to me since you will not find a better mistress of a house than i have made you she resentfully spoke i do not look for it the tenants leave your house in march do they not yes they do snapped miss corny but as we are on the subject of details of ways and means allow me to tell you that if you did what is right you would move into that house of mine and i will go to a smalleras you seem to think i shall poison barbara if i remain with her east lynne is a vast deal too fine and too grand for you i do not consider it so i shall not quit east lynne are you aware that in leaving your house i take my income with me archibald most certainly your income is yours and you will require it for your own purposes i have neither a right to nor wish for it it will make a pretty good hole in your income the withdrawing of it i can tell you that take care that you and east lynne dont go bankrupt together at this moment the summons of a visitor was heard even that excited the ire of miss carlyle i wonder whos come bothering tonight she uttered peter entered it is major thorn sir i have shown him into the drawingroom mr carlyle was surprised he had not thought major thorn within many a mile of west lynne he proceeded to the drawingroom such a journey said major thorn to mr carlyle it is my general luck to get illweather when i travel rain and hail thunder and heat nothing bad comes amiss when i am out the snow lay on the rails i dont know how thick at one station we were detained two hours are you proposing to make any stay at west lynne off again tomorrow my leave this time is to be spent at my mothers i may bestow a week of it or so on west lynne but am not sure i must be back in ireland in a month such a horrid boghole we are quartered in just now to go from one subject to another observed mr carlyle there is a question i have long thought to put to you thorn did we ever meet again which year was it that you were staying at swainson major thorn mentioned it it was the year of hallijohns murder as i thoughtin fact know said mr carlyle did you while you were stopping there ever come across a namesake of yoursone thorn i believe i did but i dont know the man of my knowledge and i saw him but once only i dont think he was living at swainson i never observed him in the town where did you meet with him at a roadside beershop about two miles from swainson i was riding one day when a fearful storm came on and i took shelter there scarcely had i entered when another horsemen rode up and he likewise took sheltera tall dandified man aristocratic and exclusive when he departedfor he quitted first the storm being overi asked the people who he was they said they did not know though they had often seen him ride by but a man who was there drinking said he was a captain thorn the same man by the way volunteered the information that he came from a distance somewhere near west lynne i remember that that captain thorn did nothat he himself did he appeared to know nothing of captain thorn beyond the name it seemed to be ever so scraps of information but nothing tangible nothing to lay hold of or to know the man by would it be thus always should you recognize him again were you to see him resumed mr carlyle awakening from his reverie i think i should there was something peculiar in his countenance and i remember it well yet were you by chance to meet him and discover his real namefor i have reason to believe that thorn the one he went by then was an assumed onewill you oblige me by letting me know it with all the pleasure in life replied the major the chances are against it though confined as i am to that confounded sister country other regiments get the luck of being quartered in the metropolis or near it ours doesnt when major thorn departed and mr carlyle was about to return to the room where he left his sister he was interrupted by joyce sir she began miss carlyle tells me that there is going to be a change at east lynne the words took mr carlyle by surprise miss carlyle has been in a hurry to tell you he remarkeda certain haughty displeasure in his tone she did not speak for the sake of telling me sir it is not likely but i fancy she was thinking about her own plans she inquired whether i would go with her when she left or whether i meant to remain at east lynne i would not answer her sir until i had spoken to you well said mr carlyle i gave a promise sir totomy late ladythat i would remain with her children as long as i was permitted she asked it of me when she was illwhen she thought she was going to die what i would inquire of you sir is whether the change will make any difference to my staying no he decisively replied i also joyce wish you to remain with the children it is well sir joyce answered and her face looked bright as she quitted the room </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxi mr dill in an embroidered shirtfront it was a lovely morning in june and all west lynne was astir west lynne generally was astir in the morning but not in the bustling manner that might be observed now people were abroad in numbers passing down to st judes church for it was the day of mr carlyles marriage to barbara hare miss carlyle made herself into a sort of martyr she would not go near it fine weddings in fine churches did not suit her she proclaimed they could </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> could tie themselves up together fast enough without her presence she had invited the little carlyles and their governess and joyce to spend the day with her and she persisted in regarding the children as martyrs too in being obliged to submit to the advent of a second mother she was back in her old house again next door to the office settled there for life now with her servants peter had mortally offended her in electing to remain at east lynne mr dill committed himself terribly on the wedding morning about ten oclock he made his appearance at miss carlyles he was a man of the old stage possessing oldfashioned notions and he had deemed that to step in to congratulate her on the auspicious day would be only good manners miss carlyle was seated in her diningroom her hands folded before her it was rare indeed that she was caught doing nothing she turned her eyes on mr dill as he entered why what on earth has taken you began she before he could speak you are decked out like a young duck i am going to the wedding miss cornelia did you know it mrs hare was so kind as to invite me to the breakfast and mr archibald insists upon my going to church i am not too fine am i poor old dills finery consisted of a white waistcoat with gold buttons and an embroidered shirtfront miss corny was pleased to regard it with sarcastic wrath fine echoed she i dont know what you call it i would not make myself such a spectacle for untold gold youll have all the ragamuffins in the street forming a tail after you thinking you are the bridegroom a man of your years to deck yourself out in a worked shirt i would have had some rosettes on my coattails while i was about it my coats quite plain miss cornelia he meekly remonstrated plain what would you have it snapped miss cornelia perhaps you covet a wreath of embroidery round it gold leaves and scarlet flowers with a swansdown collar it would only be in keeping with that shirt and waistcoat i might as well have gone and ordered a white tarletan dress looped up with peas and streamed through the town in that guise it would be just as consistent people like to dress a little out of common at a wedding miss cornelia its only respectful when they are invited guests i dont say people should go to a wedding in a hop sack but theres a medium pray do you know your age i am turned sixty miss corny you just are and do you consider it decent for an old man going on for seventy to be decorated off as you are now i dont and so i tell you my mind why youll be the laughingstock of the parish take care the boys dont tie a tin kettle to you mr dill thought he would leave the subject his own impression was that he was not too fine and that the parish would not regard him as being so still he had a great reverence for miss cornys judgment and was not altogether easy he had had his white gloves in his hand when he entered but he surreptitiously smuggled them into his pocket lest they might offend he passed to the subject which had brought him thither what i came in for was to offer you my congratulations on this auspicious day miss cornelia i hope mr archibald and his wife and you maam there you need not trouble yourself to go on interrupted miss corny hotly arresting him we want condolence here today rather than the other thing im sure id nearly as soon see archibald go to his hanging oh miss corny i would and you need not stare at me as if you were throttled what business has he to go and fetter himself with a wife again one would have thought he had had enough with the other it is as i have always said theres a soft place in archibalds brain old dill knew there was no soft place in the brain of mr carlyle but he deemed it might be as well not to say so in miss cornys present humor marriage is a happy state as i have heard maam and honorable and i am sure mr archibald very happy very honorable fiercely cried miss carlyle sarcasm in her tone his last marriage brought him all that did it not thats past and done with miss corny and none of us need recall it i hope he will find in his present wife a recompense for whats gone he could not have chosen a prettier or nicer young lady than miss barbara and i am glad to my very heart that he has got her couldnt he jerked miss carlyle no maam he could not were i young and wanted a wife theres no one in all west lynne i would so soon look out for as miss barbara not that shed have me and i was not speaking in that sense miss corny its to be hoped you were not retorted miss corny she is an idle insolent vain fagot caring for nothing but her own dolls face and for archibald ah well maam never mind that pretty young girls know they are pretty and you cant take their vanity from them shell be a good and loving wife to him i know she will it is in her nature she wont serve him asasthat other poor unfortunate did if i feared she was one to bring shame to him as the other did id go into the church this hour and forbid the marriage and if that didnt do idsmother her shrieked miss carlyle look at that piece of impudence that last sentence was uttered in a different tone and concerned somebody in the street miss carlyle hopped off her chair and strode to the window mr dills eyes turned in the like direction in a gay and summers dress fine and sparkling with a coquettish little bonnet trimmed with pink shaded by one of those nondescript articles at present called veils which article was made of white spotted net with a pink ruche round it sailed afy hallijohn conceited and foolish and goodlooking as ever catching sight of mr dill she made him a flourishing and gracious bow the courteous old gentleman returned it and was pounced upon by miss cornys tongue for his pains whatever possessed you to do that well miss corny she spoke to me you saw her i saw her yes i did see her the brazen bellwether and she saw me and spoke to you in her insolence and you must answer her in spite of my presence instead of shaking your fist and giving her a reproving frown you want a little sharp talking to yourself but miss corny its always best to let bygones be bygones he pleaded she was flighty and foolish and all that was afy but now that its proved she did not go with richard hare as was suspected and is at present living creditably why should she not be noticed if the very deuce himself stood there with his horns and tail you would find excuses to make for him fired miss corny you are as bad as archibald notice afy hallijohn when she dresses and flirts and minces as you saw her but now what creditable servant would flaunt abroad in such a dress and bonnet as that with that flimsy gauze thing over her face its as disreputable as your shirtfront mr dill coughed humbly not wishing to renew the point of the shirtfront she is not exactly a servant miss corny shes a ladys maid and ladies maids do dress outrageously fine i had great respect for her father maam never a better clerk came into our office perhaps youll tell me you have a respect for her the worlds being turned upside down i think formerly mistresses kept their servants to work now it seems they keep them for play shes going to st judes you may be sure of it to stare at this fine wedding instead of being at home in a cotton gown and white apron making beds mrs latimer must be a droll mistress to give her liberty in this way whats that fly for sharply added miss corny as one drew up to the office door fly said mr dill stretching forward his bald head it must be the one i ordered then ill wish you goodday miss corny fly for you cried miss corny have you got the gout that you could not walk to st judes on foot i am not going to the church yet i am going on to the grove miss corny i thought it would look more proper to have a fly maam more respectful not a doubt but you need it in that trim retorted she why didnt you put on pumps and silk stockings with pink clocks he was glad to bow himself out she kept on so but he thought he would do it with a pleasant remark to show her he bore no illwill just look at the crowds pouring down miss corny the church will be as full as it can cram i dare say it will retorted she one fool makes many i fear miss cornelia does not like this marriage any more than she did the last quoth mr dill to himself as he stepped into his fly such a sensible woman as she is in other things to be so bitter against mr archibald because he marries its not like her i wonder he added his thoughts changing whether i do look foolish in this shirt im sure i never thought of decking myself out to appear youngas miss corny saidi only wished to testify respect to mr archibald and miss barbara nothing else would have made me give fiveandtwenty shillings for it perhaps its not etiquetteor whatever they call itto wear them in the morning miss corny ought to know and there certainly must be something wrong about it by the way it put her up well it cant be helped now it must go theres no time to return home now to change it st judes church was in a cram all the world and his wife had flocked into it those who could not get in took up their station in the churchyard and in the road well it was a goodly show ladies and gentlemen as smart as fine feathers could make them mr carlyle was one of the first to enter the church selfpossessed and calm the very sense of a gentleman oh but he was noble to look upon though when was he otherwise mr and mrs clithero were there anne hare that was a surprise for some of the gazers who had not known they were expected at the wedding gentle delicate mrs hare walked up the church leaning on the arm of sir john dobede a paler shade than usual on her sweet sad face shes thinking of her wretched illdoing son quoth the gossips one to another but who comes in now with an air as if the whole church belonged to him an imposing pompous man stern and grim in a new flaxen wig and a white rose in his buttonhole it is mr justice hare and he leads in one whom folks jump upon seats to get a look at very lovely was barbara in her soft white silk robes and her floating veil her cheeks now blushing rosy red now pale as the veil that shaded them betrayed how intense was her emotion the bridesmaids came after her with jaunty steps vain in their important officelouisa dobede augusta and kate herbert and mary pinner mr carlyle was already in his place at the altar and as barbara neared him he advanced took her hand and placed her on his left i dont think that it was quite usual but he had been married before and ought to know the clerk directed the rest where to stand and after some little </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> little delay the service proceeded in spite of her emotionand that it was great scarcely to be suppressed none could doubtbarbara made the responses bravely be you very sure that a woman who loves him she is being united to must experience this emotion wilt though have this man to be thy wedded husband to live together after gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony spoke the rev mr little wilt thou obey him and serve him love honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live i will clearly firmly impressively was the answer given it was as if barbara had in her thoughts one who had not kept holy unto him and would proclaim her own resolution never so to betray him god helping her the ceremony was very soon over and barbara the magic ring upon her finger and her arm within mr carlyles was led out to his chariot now hershad he not just endowed her with his worldly goods the crowd shouted and hurrahed as they caught sight of her blushing face but the carriage was soon clear of the crowd who concentrated their curiosity upon the other carriages that were to follow it the company were speeding back to the grove to breakfast mr carlyle breaking the silence suddenly turned to his bride and spoke his tone impassioned almost unto pain barbara you will keep your vows to me she raised her shy blue eyes so full of love to his earnest feeling had brought the tears to them always in the spirit and in the letter until death shall claim me so help me heaven the german wateringplaces were crowded that early autumn they generally are crowded at that season now that the english flock abroad in shoals like the swallows quitting our cold country to return again some time france has been pretty well used up so now we fall upon germany stalkenberg was that year particularly full for its sizeyou might have put it in a nutshell and it derived its importance name and most else belonging to it from its lord of the soil the baron von stalkenberg a stalwart old man was the baron with grizzly hair a grizzled beard and manners as loutish as those of the boars he hunted he had four sons as stalwart as himself and who promised to be in time as grizzled they were all styled the counts von stalkenberg being distinguished by their christian namesall save the eldest son and he was generally called the young baron two of them were awaysoldiers and two the eldest and the youngest lived with their father in the tumbledown castle of stalkenberg situated about a mile from the village to which it gave its name the young baron von stalkenberg was at liberty to marry the three counts von stalkenberg were notunless they could pick up a wife with enough money to keep herself and her husband in this creed they had been brought up it was a perfectly understood creed and not rebelled against the young baron von stalkenberg who was only styled young in contradistinction to his father being in his fortyfirst year was famous for a handsome person and for his passionate love of the chase of wild boars and wolves he was the deadly enemy the count otto von stalkenberg eleven years his brothers junior was famous for nothing but his fiercelyringed moustache a habit of eating and an undue addiction to draughts of marcobrunen somewhat meager fare so report ran was the fashion in the castle of stalkenbergneither the old baron nor his heir cared for luxury therefore count von otto was sure to be seen at the table d hote as often as anybody would invite him and that was nearly every day for the count von stalkenberg was a highsounding title and his baronial father proprietor of all stalkenberg lorded it in the baronial castle close by all of which appeared very grand and great and that the english bow down to with an idols worship stopping at the ludwig bad the chief hotel in the place was a family of the name of crosby it consisted of mr and mrs crosby an only daughter her governess and two or three servants what mr crosby had done to england or england to him i cant say but he never went near his native country for years and years he had lived abroadnot in any settled place of residence they would travel about and remain a year or two in one place a year or two in another as the whim suited them a respectable portly man of quiet and gentlemanly manners looking as little like one who need be afraid of the laws of his own land as can be neither is it said or insinuated that he was afraid of them a gentleman who knew him had told many years before in answer to a doubt that crosby was as free to go home and establish himself in a mansion in piccadilly as the best of them but he had lost fearfully by some roguish scheme like the south sea bubble and could not live in the style he once had done therefore preferred remaining abroad mrs crosby was a pleasant chatty woman given to take as much gayety as she could get and helena crosby was a remarkably fine grown girl of seventeen you might have given her some years on it had you been guessing her age for she was no child either in appearance or manners and never had been she was an heiress too an uncle had left her twenty thousand pounds and at her mothers death she would have ten thousand more the count otto von stalkenberg heard of the thirty thousand pounds and turned his fierce moustache and his eyes on miss helena thirty thousand pounds and von handsome girls cogitated he for he prided himself upon his english it is just what i have been seeking after he found the rumor touching her fortune to be correct and from that time was seldom apart from the crosbys they were as pleased to have his society as he was to be in theirs for was he not the count von stalkenberg and the other visitors at stalkenberg looking on with envy would have given their ears to be honored with a like intimacy one day there thundered down in a vehicle the old baron von stalkenberg the old chief had come to pay a visit of ceremony to the crosbys and the host of the ludwig bad as he appeared himself to marshal this chieftain to their saloon bowed his body low with every step room there room there for the mighty baron von stalkenberg the mighty baron had come to invite them to a feast at his castle where no feast had ever been made so grand before as this would be and otto had carte blanche to engage other distinguished sojourners at stalkenberg english french and natives who had been civil to him mrs crosbys head was turned and now i ask you knowing as you do our national notions was it not enough to turn it you will not then be surprised to hear that when some days subsequent to the feast the count otto von stalkenberg laid his proposals at helenas feet they were not rejected helena crosby rushed into her governesss room madam madam only think i am going to be married madam lifted her pale sad facea very sad and pale face was hers indeed she gently uttered and my studies are to be over from today mamma says so you are over young to marry helena now dont you bring up that madam it is just what papa is harping upon returned miss helena it is to count otto and it may be remarked that the governesss english was perfect although the young lady addressed her as madam count otto of course as if i would marry anybody else look at the governess reader and see whether you know her you will say no but you do for it is lady isabel vane but how strangely she is altered yes the railway accident did that for her and what the accident left undone grief and remorse accomplished she limps as she walks and slightly stoops taken from her former height a scar extends from her chin above her mouth completely changing the character of the lower part of her face some of her teeth are missing so that she speaks with a lisp and the sober bands of her gray hairit is nearly silverare confined under a large and close cap she herself tries to make the change greater so that all chance of being recognized may be at an end and for that reason she wears disfiguring spectacles and a broad band of gray velvet coming down low upon her forehead her dress too is equally disfiguring never is she seen in one that fits her person but in those frightful loose jackets which must surely have been invented by somebody envious of a pretty shape as to her bonnet it would put to shame those masquerade things tilted on to the back of the head for it actually shaded her face and she was never seen out without a thick veil she was pretty easy upon the score of being recognized now for mrs ducie and her daughters had been sojourning at stalkenberg and they did not know her in the least who could know her what resemblance was there between that gray brokendown woman with her disfiguring marks and the once loved lady isabel with her bright color her beauty her dark flowing curls and her agile figure mr carlyle himself could not have told her but she was goodlooking still in spite of it all gentle and interesting and people wondered to see that gray hair in one yet young she had been with the crosbys going on for two years after her recovery from the railway accident she removed to a quiet town in the vicinity they were living there and she became daily governess to helena the crosbys were given to understand that she was english but the widow of a frenchmanshe was obliged to offer some plausible account there were no references but she so won upon their esteem as the daily governess that they soon took her into the house had lady isabel surmised that they would be travelling to so conspicuous a spot as an englishfrequented german wateringplace she might have hesitated to accept the engagement however it had been of service to her the meeting with mrs ducie proving that she was altered beyond chance of recognition she could go anywhere now but now about her state of mind i dont know how to describe it the vain yearning the inward fever the restless longing for what might not be longing for what for her children let the mother be she a duchess or be she an applewoman at a stand be separated for awhile from her little children let her answer how she yearns for them she may be away on a tour of pleasure for a few weeks the longing to see their little faces again to hear their prattling tongues to feel their soft kisses is kept under and there may be frequent messages the childrens dear love to mamma but as the weeks lengthen out the desire to see them again becomes almost irrepressible what must it have been then for lady isabel who had endured this longing for years talk of the mal du pays which is said to attack the swiss when exiled from their countrythat is as nothing compared to the heartsickness which clung to lady isabel she had passionately loved her children she had been anxious for their welfare in all ways and not the least she had to endure now was the thought that she had abandoned them to be trained by strangers would they be trained to goodness to morality to religion careless as she herself had once been upon these points she had learnt better now would isabel grow up to indifference </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> indifference toperhaps do as she had done lady isabel flung her hands before her eyes and groaned in anguish it happened that mrs latimer a lady living at west lynne betook herself about that time to stalkenberg and with her three parts maid and one part companion went afy hallijohn not that afy was admitted to the society of mrs latimer to sit with her or dine with her nothing of that but she did enjoy more privileges than most ladies maids do and afy who was never backward at setting off her own consequence gave out that she was companion mrs latimer was an easy woman fond of afy and afy had made her own tale good to her respecting the illnatured reports at the time of the murder so that mrs latimer looked upon her as one to be compassionated mrs latimer and mrs crosby whose apartments in the hotel joined struck up a violent friendship the one for the other ere the former had been a week at the ludwig they had sworn something like eternal sisterhoodas both had probably done for others fifty times before </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxii meeting of lady isabel and afy on the evening of the day when helena crosby communicated her future prospects to lady isabel the latter strolled out in the twilight and took her seat on a bench in an unfrequented part of the gardens where she was fond of sitting now it occurred that afy some minutes afterwards found herself in the same walkand a very dull one too she was thinking whos that quoth afy to herself her eyes falling upon lady isabel oh its that governess of the crosbys she may be known a half a mile off by her grandmothers bonnet ill go and have a chat with her accordingly afy who was never troubled with bashfulness went up and seated herself beside lady isabel good evening madame vine cried she good evening replied lady isabel courteously not having the least idea who afy might be you dont know me i fancy pursued afy so gathering from lady isabels looks i am companion to mrs latimer and she is spending the evening with mrs crosby precious dull this stalkenberg do you think so it is for me i cant speak german or french and the upper attendants of families here cant most of them speak english im sure i go about like an owl able to do nothing but stare i was sick enough to come here but id rather be back at west lynne quiet as it is lady isabel had not been encouraging her companion either by words or manner but the last sentence caused her heart to bound within her control herself as she would she could not quite hide her feverish interest do you come from west lynne yes horrid place mrs latimer took a house there soon after i went to live with her id rather shed taken it at botany bay why do you not like it because i dont was afys satisfactory answer do you know east lynne resumed lady isabel her heart beating and her brain whirling as she deliberated how she could put all the questions she wished to ask i ought to know it returned afy my own sister miss hallijohn is head maid there why do you know it madame vine lady isabel hesitated she was deliberating upon her answer some years ago i was staying in the neighborhood for a little time she said i should like to hear of the carlyles again they were a nice family afy tossed her head ah but there have been changes since that i dare say you knew them in the time of lady isabel another pause lady isabel yes she was mr carlyles wife and a nice wife she made him ironically rejoined afy you must have heard of it madame vine unless you lived in the wood she elopeabandoned him and her children are the children living yes poor things but the ones on the road to the churchyardif ever i saw threatened consumption yet joyce thats my sister is in a flaring temper when i say it she thinks it will get strong again lady isabel passed her handkerchief across her moist brow which of the children is it she faintly asked isabel isabel retorted afy whos isabel the eldest child i mean miss isabel carlyle theres no isabel theres lucy shes the only daughter whenwheni knew them there was only one daughter the other two were boys i remember quite well that she was called isabel stay said afy now you speak of it what was it that i heard it was wilson told me i recollectshes the nurse why the very night that his wife went away mr carlyle gave orders that the child in future should be called lucy her second name no wonder added afy violently indignant that he could no lager endure the sound of her mothers or suffer the child to bear it no wonder murmured lady isabel which child is it thats ill its william the eldest boy he is not to say ill but he is as thin as a herring with an unnaturally bright look on his cheek and a glaze upon his eye joyce says that his cheeks are no brighter than his mothers were but i know better folks in health dont have those brilliant colors did you ever see lady isabel she asked in a low tone not i returned afy i should have thought it demeaning one does not care to be brought into contact with that sort of misdoing lot you know madame vine there as another one a little boyarchibald i think his name was is he well oh the troublesome youngster he is as sturdy as a turk no fear of his going into consumption he is the very image of mr carlyle is that child i say though madame continued afy changing the subject unceremoniously if you were stopping at west lynne perhaps you heard some wicked mischiefmaking stories concerning me i believe i did hear your name mentioned i cannot charge my memory now with the particulars my father was murderedyou must have heard of that yes i recollect so far he was murdered by a chap called richard hare who decamped instanter perhaps you know the hares also well directly after the funeral i left west lynne i could not bear the place and i stopped away and what do you suppose they said of me that i had gone after richard hare not that i knew they were saying it or i should pretty soon have been back and given them the length of my tongue but now i just ask you as a lady madame vine whether a more infamous accusation was ever pitched upon and you had not gone after him no that i swear passionately returned afy make myself a companion of my fathers murderer if mr calcraft the hangman finished off a few of those west lynne scandalmongers it might be a warning to the others i said so to mr carlyle to mr carlyle repeated lady isabel hardly conscious that she did repeat it he laughed i remember and said that would not stop the scandal the only one who did not misjudge me was himself he did not believe that i was with richard hare but he was ever noblejudging was mr carlyle i suppose you were in a situation afy coughed to be sure more than one i lived as companion with an old lady who so valued me that she left me a handsome legacy in her will i lived two years with the countess of mount severn with the countess of mount severn echoed lady isabel surprised into the remark why sheshewas related to mr carlyles wife at least lord mount severn was of course everybody knows that i was living there at the time the business happened didnt the countess pull lady isabel to pieces she and miss levison used to sit cant cant all day over it oh i assure you i know all about it just as much as joyce did have you got that headache that you are leaning on your hand headache and heartache both she might have answered miss afy resumed so after the flattering compliment west lynne had paid to me you may judge i was in no hurry to go back to it madame vine and if i had not found that mrs latimers promised to be an excellent place i should have left it rather than be marshaled there but i have lived it down i should like to hear any of them fibbing against me now do you know that blessed miss corny i have seen her she shakes her head and makes eyes at me still but so she would at an angel a crossgrained old cockatoo is she still at east lynne not she indeed there would be drawn battles between her and mrs carlyle if she were a dart as of an icebolt seemed to arrest the blood in lady isabels veins mrs carlyle she faltered who is mrs carlyle mr carlyles wifewho should she be the rushing blood leaped on now fast and fiery i did not know he had married again he has been married nowoh getting on for fifteen months a twelvemonth last june i went to the church to see them married wasnt there a cram she looked beautiful that day lady isabel laid her hand upon her breast but for that delectable loose jacket afy might have detected her bosom rise and fall she steadied her voice sufficiently to speak did he marry barbara hare you may take your oath of that said afy if folks tell true there was love scenes between them before he ever thought of lady isabel i had that from wilson and she ought to know for she lived at the hares another thing is saidonly you must just believe one word of west lynne talk and disbelieve tenthat if lady isabel had not died mr carlyle never would have married again he had scruples half a dozen were given him by report louisa dobede for one and mary pinner for another such nonsense folks might have made sure it would be barbara hare theres a baby now is there was the faint answer a beautiful boy three or four months old mrs carlyle is not a little proud of him she worships her husband is she kind to the first children for all i know i dont think she has much to do with them archibald is in the nursery and the other two are mostly with the governess i wonder cried the governess how the tidings of lady isabels death were received at east lynne i dont know anything about that they held it as a jubilee i should say and set all the bells in town to ring and feasted the men upon legs of mutton and onion sauce afterward i should i know a brute animal deaf and dumb such as a cow or a goose clings to its offspring but she abandoned hers are you going in madame vine i must go in now good evening to you she had sat till she could sit no longer her very heartstrings were wrung and she might not rise up in defence of herself defence did she not deserve more ten thousand times more reproach than had met her ears now this girl did not say of her half what the world must say there is a governess nearly the first thing that mr carlyle did after his wifes moonlight flitting was to seek a governess and she has been there ever since she is going to leave now to be married joyce told me are you much at east lynne afy shook her head i am not going much i can tell you where i am looked down upon mrs carlyle does not favor me she knew that her brother richard would have given his hand to marry me and she resents it not such a great catch im sure that dick hare even if he had gone on right continued afy somewhat after the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense4> the example of the fox looking at the unattainable grapes he had no brains to speak of and what he had were the color of a peacocks tailgreen to bed at the usual time but not to sleep what she had heard only increased her vain insensate longing a stepmother at east lynne and one of her children gliding on to death oh to be with them to see them once again to purchase that boon she would willingly forfeit all the rest of her existence her frame was fevered the bed was fevered and she arose and paced the room this state of mind would inevitably bring on bodily illness possibly an attack of the brain she dreaded that for there was no telling what she might reveal in her delirium her temples were throbbing her heart was beating and she once more threw herself upon the bed and pressed the pillow down upon her forehead there is no doubt that the news of mr carlyles marriage helped greatly the excitement she did not pray to die but she did wish that death might come to her what would have been the ending it is impossible to say but a strange turn in affairs came one of those wonderful coincidences sometimes but not often to be met with mrs crosby appeared in madame vines room after breakfast and gave her an account of helenas projected marriage she then apologized the real object of her visit for dispensing so summarily with madames services but had reason to hope that she could introduce her to another situation would madame have any objection to take one in england madame was upon the point of replying that she should not choose to enter one in england when mrs crosby stopped her saying that she would call in mrs latimer who could tell her about it better than she could mrs latimer came in all eagerness and volubility ah my dear madame she exclaimed you would be fortunate indeed if you were to get into this family the nicest people they are he so liked and respected she so pretty and engaging a most desirable situation too treated as a lady and all things comfortable theres only one pupil a girl one of the little boys i believe goes in for an hour or two but thats not much and the salarys seventy guineas they are friends of mine the carlyles such a beautiful place they live ateast lynne the carlyles east lynne go governess there lady isabels breath was taken away they are parting with their governess continued mrs latimer and when i was there a day or two before i started on my tour to germany mrs carlyle said to me i suppose you could not pick us up a desirable governess for lucy one who is mistress of french and german she spoke in a half joking tone but i feel sure that were i to write word i had found one desirable it would give her pleasure now mrs crosby tells me your french is quite that of a native madame vine that you read and speak german well and that your musical abilities are excellent i think you would be just the one to suit and i have no doubt i could get you the situation what do you say what could she say her brain was in a whirl i am anxious to find you one if i can put in mrs crosby we have been much pleased with you and i should like you to be desirably placed as mrs latimer is so kind as to interest herself it appears to me an opportunity that should not be missed shall i write to mrs carlyle rejoined mrs latimer lady isabel roused herself and so far cleared her intellect as to understand and answer the question perhaps you would kindly give me until tomorrow morning to consider on it i had not intended to take a situation in england a battle she had with herself that day at one moment it seemed to her that providence must have placed this opportunity in her way that she might see her children in her desperate longing at another a voice appeared to whisper that it was a wily dangerous temptation flung across her path one which it was her duty to resist and flee from then came another phase of the picturehow should she bear to see mr carlyle the husband of anotherto live in the same house with them to witness his attentions possibly his caresses it might be difficult but she could force and school her heart to endurance had she not resolved in her first bitter repentance to take up her cross daily and bear it no her own feelings let them be wrung as they would should not prove the obstacle evening came and she had not decided she passed another night of pain of restlessness of longing for her children this intense longing appeared to be overmastering all her powers of mind and body the temptation at length proved too strong the project having been placed before her covetous eyes could not be relinquished and she finally consented to go what is it that would keep me away she argued the dread of discovery well if that comes it must they could not hang me or kill me deeper humiliation than ever would be my portion when they drive me from east lynne with abhorrence and ignominy as a soldier is drummed out of his regiment but i could bear that as i must bear the rest and i can shrink under the hedge and lay myself down to die humiliation for me no i will not put that in comparison with seeing and being with my children mrs latimer wrote to mrs carlyle she had met with a governess one desirable in every way who could not fail to suit her views precisely she was a madame vine english by birth but the widow of a frenchman a protestant a thorough gentlewoman an efficient linguist and musician and competent to her duties in all ways mrs crosby with whom she had lived two years regarded her as a treasure and would not have parted with her but for helenas marriage with a german nobleman you must not mind her appearance went on the letter she is the oddestlooking person wears spectacles caps enormous bonnets and has a great scar on her mouth and chin and though she cant be more than thirty her hair is gray she is also slightly lame but understand you she is a lady with it all and looks one when this description reached east lynne barbara laughed at it as she read it aloud to mr carlyle he laughed also it is well governesses are not chosen according to their looks he said or i fear madame vine would stand but a poor chance they resolved to engage her and word went back to that effect a strangely wild tumult filled lady isabels bosom she first of all hunted her luggage over her desk everything belonging to her lest any mark on the linen might be there which could give a clue to her former self the bulk of her luggage remained in paris warehoused where it had been sent ere she quitted grenoble she next saw to her wardrobe making it still more unlike anything she had used to wear her caps save that they were simple and fitted closely to the face nearly rivaled those of miss carlyle her handwriting she had been striving for years to change the character of and had so far succeeded that none would now take it for lady isabel vanes but her hand shook as she wrote to mrs carlylewho had written to her sheshe writing to mr carlyles wife and in the capacity of a subordinate how would she like to live with her as a subordinate as servantit may be saidwhere she had once reigned the idolized lady she must bear that as she must bear all else hot tears came into her eyes with a gush as they fell on the signature barbara carlyle all ready she sat down and waited the signal of departure but that was not to be yet it was finally arranged that she should travel to england and to west lynne with mrs latimer and that lady would not return until october lady isabel could only fold her hands and strive for patience but the day did comeit actually did and mrs latimer lady isabel and afy quitted stalkenberg mrs latimer would only travel slowly and the impatient fevered woman thought the journey would never end you have been informed i think of the position of these unhappy children that you are going to mrs latimer observed to her one day you must not speak to them of their mother she left them yes it is never well to speak to children of a mother who has disgraced them mr carlyle would not like it and i dare say they are taught to forget her and to regard mrs carlyle as their only mother her aching heart had to assent to all it was a foggy afternoon gray with the coming twilight when they arrived at west lynne mrs latimer believing the governess was a novice in england kindly put her into a fly and told the driver his destination au revoir madame she said and good luck to you once more she was whirling along the familiar road she saw justice hares house she saw other marks which she knew well and once more she saw east lynne the dear old house for the fly had turned into the avenue lights were moving in the windows it looked gay and cheerful a contrast to her her heart was sick with expectation her throat was beating and as the man thundered up with all the force of his one horse and halted at the steps her sight momentarily left her would mr carlyle come to the fly to hand her out she wished she had never undertaken the project now in the depth of her fear and agitation the hall door was flung open and there gushed forth a blaze of light two menservants stood there the one remained in the hall the other advanced to the chaise he assisted lady isabel to alight and then busied himself with the luggage as she ascended to the hall she recognized old peter strange indeed did it seem not to say how are you peter but to meet him as a stranger for a moment she was at a loss for words what should she say or ask coming to her own home her manner was embarrassed her voice low is mrs carlyle within yes maam at that moment joyce came forward to receive her it is madame vine i believe she respectfully said please to step this way madame but lady isabel lingered in the hall ostensibly to see that her boxes came in rightstephen was bringing them upin reality to gather a short respite for joyce might be about to usher her into the presence of mr and mrs carlyle joyce however did nothing of the sort she merely conducted her to the gray parlor a fire was burning in the grate looking cheerful on the autumn night this is your sittingroom madame what will you please to take i will order it brought in while i show you your bedchamber a cup of tea answered lady isabel tea and some cold meat suggested joyce but lady isabel interrupted her nothing but tea and a little cold toast joyce rang the bell ordered the refreshment to be made ready and then preceded lady isabel upstairs on she followed her heart palpitating past the rooms that used to be hers along the corridor toward the second staircase the door of her old dressingroom stood open and she glanced in with a yearning look no never more never more could it be hers she had put it from her by her own free act and deed not less comfortable did it look now than in former days but it had passed into anothers occupancy the fire threw its blaze on the </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> the furniture there were the little ornaments on the large dressingtable as they used to be in her time and the cut glass of crystal essencebottles was glittering in the firelight on the sofa lay a shawl and a book and on the bed a silk dress as thrown there after being taken off no those rooms were not for her now and she followed joyce up the other staircase the bedroom she was shown to was commodious and well furnished it was the one miss carlyle had occupied when she isabella had been taken a bride to east lynne though that lady had subsequently quitted it for one on the lower floor joyce put down the waxlight she carried and looked round would you like a fire lighted here madame for tonight perhaps it will feel welcome after travelling oh no thank you was the answer stephen with somebody to help him was bringing up the luggage joyce directed him where to place it telling him to uncord the boxes that done the man left the room and joyce turned to lady isabel who had stood like a statue never so much as attempting to remove her bonnet can i do anything for you madame she asked lady isabel declined in the first moments of her arrival she was dreading detectionhow was it possible that she should notand she feared joyces keen eyes more perhaps than she feared any others she was only wishing that the girl would go down should you want anything please to ring and hannah will come up said joyce preparing to retire she is the maid who waits upon the gray parlor and will do anything you like up here joyce had quitted the room and lady isabel had got her bonnet off when the door opened again she hastily thrust it on somewhat after the fashion of richard hares rushing on his hat and false whiskers it was joyce do you think you shall find your way down alone madame yes i can do that she answered find her way in that house lady isabel slowly took her things off what was the use of lingeringshe must meet their eyes sooner or later though in truth there was little if any fear of her detection so effectually was she disguised by natures altering hand or by arts it was with the utmost difficulty she kept tranquil had the tears once burst forth they would have gone on to hysterics without the possibility of control the coming home again to east lynne oh it was indeed a time of agitation terrible painful agitation and none can wonder at it shall i tell you what she did yes i will at the expense of ridicule she knelt down by the bed and prayed for courage to go through the task she had undertaken prayed for selfcontroleven she the sinful who had quitted that house under circumstances notorious but i am not sure that this mode of return to it was an expedition precisely calculated to call down a blessing there was no excuse for lingering longer and she descended the waxlight in her hand everything was ready in the gray parlorthe teatray on the table the small urn hissing away the teacaddy in proximity to it a silver rack of dry toast butter and a hot muffin covered with a small silver cover the things were to her sight as old facesthe rack the small cover the butterdish the teaserviceshe remembered them all not the urna copper oneshe had no recollection of that it had possibly been bought for the use of the governess when a governess came into use at east lynne could she have given herself leisure to reflect on the matter she might have told by the signs observable in the short period she had been in the house that governesses of east lynne were regarded as gentlewomentreated well and liberally yes for east lynne owned mr carlyle for its master she made the tea and sat down with what appetite she might her brain her thoughts all in a chaos together she wondered whether mr and mrs carlyle were at dinnershe wondered in what part of the house were the children she heard bells ring now and then she heard servants cross and recross the hall her meal over she rang her own a neatlooking goodtempered maid answered it hannah who as joyce had informed her waited upon the gray parlor and was at her the governesss especial command she took away the things and then lady isabel sat on alone for how long she scarcely knew when a sound caused her heart to beat as if it would burst its bounds and she started from her chair like one who has received an electric shock it was nothing to be startled at eitherfor ordinary peoplefor it was but the sound of childrens voices her children were they being brought in to her she pressed her hand upon her heaving bosom no they were but traversing the hall and the voices faded away up the wide staircase perhaps they had been in to desert as in the old times and were now going up to bed she looked at her new watchhalf past seven her new watch the old one had been changed away for it all her trinkets had been likewise parted with sold or exchanged away lest they should be recognized at east lynne nothing whatever had she kept except her mothers miniature and a small golden cross set with its seven emeralds have you forgotten that cross francis levison accidentally broke it for her the first time they ever met if she had looked upon the breaking of that cross which her mother had enjoined her to set such store by as an evil omen at the time of the accident how awfully had the subsequent events seemed to bear her fancy out these two articlesthe miniature and the crossshe could not bring her mind to part with she had sealed them up and placed them in the remotest spot of her dressingcase away from all chance of public view peter entered my mistress says maam she would be glad to see you if you are not too tired will you please to walk into the drawingroom a mist swam before her eyes was she about to enter the presence of mrs carlyle had the moment really come she moved to the door which peter held open she turned her head from the man for she could feel how ashy white were her face and lips is mrs carlyle alone she asked in a subdued voice the most indirect way she could put the question as to whether mr carlyle was there quite alone maam my master is dining out today madame vine i think he added waiting to announce her as the hall traversed he laid his hand on the drawingroom door madame vine she said correcting him for peter had spoken the name vine broadly according to our english habitude she set him right and pronounced it a la mode francaise madame vine maam quoth peter to his mistress as he ushered in lady isabel the old familiar drawingroom its large handsome proportions the well arranged furniture its bright chandelier it all came back to her with a heartsickness no longer her drawingroom that she should take pride in it she had flung it away from her when she flung away the rest seated under the blaze of the chandelier was barbara not a day older did she look than when lady isabel had first seen her at the churchyard gates when she had inquired of her husband who was that pretty girl barbara hare he answered ay she was barbara hare then but now she was barbara carlyle and she she who had been isabel carlyle was isabel vane again oh woe woe inexpressibly more beautiful looked barbara than lady isabel had ever seen heror else she fancied it her evening dress was of pale skyblueno other color suited barbara so well and there was no other she was so fond ofand on her fair neck there was a gold chain and on her arms were gold bracelets her pretty features were attractive as ever her cheeks were flushed her blue eyes sparkled and her light hair was rich and abundant a contrast her hair to that of the worn woman opposite to her barbara came forward her hand stretched out with a kindly greeting i hope you are not very much tired after your journey lady isabel murmured somethingshe did not know whatand pushed the chair set for her as much as possible into the shade you are not ill are you uttered barbara noting the intensely pale faceas much as could be seen of it for the cap and the spectacles not ill was the low answer only a little fatigued would you prefer that i spoke with you in the morning you would like possibly to retire to bed at once but lady isabel declined better get the interview over by candlelight than by daylight you look so very pale i feared you might be ill i am generally pale sometimes remarkably so but my health is good mrs latimer wrote us word that you would be quite sure to suit us freely spoke barbara i hope you will and that you may find your residence here agreeable have you lived much in england in the early portion of my life and you have lost your husband and your children stay i beg your pardon if i am making a mistake i think mrs latimer did mention children i have lost them was the faint quiet response oh but it must be terrible grief when children die exclaimed barbara clasping her hands in emotion i would not lose my babe for the world i could not part with him terrible grief and hard to bear outwardly assented lady isabel but in her heart she was thinking that death was not the worst kind of parting there was another far more dreadful mrs carlyle began to speak of the children she was to take charge of you are no doubt aware that they are not mine mrs latimer would tell you they are the children of mr carlyles first wife and mr carlyles interrupted lady isabel what in the world made her put in that she wondered herself the moment the words were out of her mouth a scarlet streak flushed her cheeks and she remembered that there must be no speaking upon impulse at east lynne mr carlyles of course said barbara believing madame vine had asked the question their positionthe girls in particularis a sad one for their mother left them oh it was a shocking business she is dead i hear said lady isabel hoping to turn the immediate point of conversation mrs carlyle however continued as though she had not heard her mr carlyle married lady isabel vane the late lord mount severns daughter she was attractive and beautiful but i do not fancy she cared very much for her husband however that may have been she ran away from him it was very sad observed lady isabel feeling that she was expected to say something besides she had her role to play sad it was wickedit was infamous returned mrs carlyle giving way to some excitement of all men living of all husbands mr carlyle least deserved such a requital you will say so when you come to know and the affair altogether was a mystery for it never was observed or suspected by any one that lady isabel entertained a liking for another it was francis levison she eloped withsir francis he is now he had been staying at east lynne but no one detected any undue intimacy between them not even mr carlyle to him as others her conduct must always remain a mystery madame appeared to be occupied with her spectacles setting them straight barbara continued of course the disgrace is reflected on the children and always will be the shame of having a divorced mother is she not dead interrupted lady isabel she is deadoh yes but they will not be the less pointed at the girl especially as i </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> i say they allude to their mother now and then in conversation wilson tells me but i would recommend you madame vine not to encourage them in that they had better forget her mr carlyle would naturally wish them to do so most certainly there is little doubt that mr carlyle would blot out the recollection of her were it possible but unfortunately she was the childrens mother and for that theres no help i trust you will be able to instill principles into the little girl which will keep her from a like fate i will try answered lady isabel with more fervor than she had yet spoken do you have the children much with you may i inquire no i never was fond of being troubled with children when my own grow up into childhood i shall deem the nursery and the schoolroom the fitter place for them what i trust i shall never give up to another will be the training of my children pursued barbara let the offices properly pertaining to a nurse be performed by the nurseof course taking care that she is thoroughly to be depended on let her have the trouble of the children their noise their romping in short let the nursery be her place and the childrens but i hope that i shall never fail to gather my children round me daily at stated and convenient periods for higher purposes to instill into them christian and moral duties to strive to teach them how best to fulfil the obligations of life this is a mothers taskas i understand the questionlet her do this work well and the nurse can attend to the rest a child should never hear aught from his mothers lips but persuasive gentleness and this becomes impossible if she is very much with her children lady isabel silently assented mrs carlyles views were correct ones when i first came to east lynne i found miss manning the governess was doing everything necessary for mr carlyles children in the way of the training that i speak of resumed barbara she had them with her for a short period every morning even the little one i saw that it was all right therefore did not interfere since she leftit is nearly a month nowi have taken them myself we were sorry to part with miss manning she suited very well but she has been long engaged it turns out to an officer in the navy and now they are to be married you will have the entire charge of the little girl she will be your companion out of school hours did you understand that i am quite ready and willing to undertake it said lady isabel her heart fluttering are the children well do they enjoy good health quite so they had the measles in the spring and the illness left a cough upon william the eldest boy mr wainwright says he will outgrow it he has it still then at night and morning they went last week to spend the day with miss carlyle and were a little late in returning home it was foggy and the boy coughed dreadfully after he came in mr carlyle was so concerned that he left the dinner table and went up to the nursery he gave joyce strict orders that the child should never again be out in the evening so long as the cough was upon him we had never heard him cough like that do you fear consumption asked lady isabel in a low tone i do not fear that or any other incurable disease for them answered barbara i think with mr wainwright that time will remove the cough the children come of a healthy stock on the fathers side and i have no reason to think they do not on their mothers she died young you will say ay but she did not die of disease her death was the result of accident mrs latimer wrote us word you were of gentle birth and breeding she continued changing the subject of conversation i am sure you will excuse my speaking of these particulars barbara added in a tone of apology but this is our first interviewour preliminary interview it may in a measure be called for we could not say much by letter i was born and reared a gentlewoman answered lady isabel yes i am sure of it there is no mistaking the tone of a gentlewoman said barbara how sad it is when pecuniary reverses fall upon us i dare say you never thought to go out as a governess a half smile positively crossed her lips she think to go out as a governessthe earl of mount severns only child oh no never she said in reply your husband i fear could not leave you well off mrs latimer said something to that effect when i lost him i lost all was the answer and mrs carlyle was struck with the wailing pain betrayed in the tone at that moment a maid entered nurse says the baby is undressed and quite ready for you maam she said addressing her mistress mrs carlyle rose but hesitated as she was moving away i will have the baby here tonight she said to the girl tell nurse to put a shawl round him and bring him down it is the hour for my babys supper she smiled turning to lady isabel i may as well have him here for once as mr carlyle is out sometimes i am out myself and then he has to be fed you do not stay indoors for the baby then certainly not if i and mr carlyle have to be out in the evening baby gives way i should never give up my husband for my baby never never dearly as i love him the nurse came inwilson she unfolded a shawl and placed the baby on mrs carlyles lap a proud fine fair young baby who reared his head and opened wide his great blue eyes and beat his arms at the lights of the chandelier as no baby of nearly six months ever did yet so thought barbara he was in his clean white nightgown and nightcap with their pretty crimped frills and border altogether a pleasant sight to look upon she had once sat in that very chair with a baby as fair upon her own knee but all that was past and gone she leaned her hot head upon her hand and a rebellious sigh of envy went forth from her aching heart wilson the curious was devouring her with her eyes wilson was thinking she never saw such a mortal fright as the new governess them blue spectacles capped everything she decided and what on earth made her tie up her throat in that fashion as well wear a mans color and stock at once if her teaching was no better than her looks miss lucy might as well go to the parish charity school shall i wait maam demurely asked wilson her investigation being concluded no said mrs carlyle i will ring baby was exceedingly busy taking his supper and of course according to all baby precedent he ought to have gone off into a sound sleep over it but the supper concluded and the gentleman seemed to have no more sleep in his eyes than he had before he began he sat up crowed at the lights stretched out his hands for them and set his mother at defiance absolutely refusing to be hushed up do you wish to keep awake all night you rebel cried barbara fondly looking on him a loud crow by way of answer perhaps it was intended to intimate he did she clasped him to her with a sudden gesture of rapture a sound of love and devoured his pretty face with kisses then she took him in her arms putting him to sit upright and approached madame vine did you ever see a more lovely child a fine baby indeed she constrained herself to answer and she could have fancied it her own little archibald over again when he was a baby but he is not much like you he is the very image of my darling husband when you see mr carlyle barbara stopped and bent her ear as listening mr carlyle is probably a handsome man said poor lady isabel believing that the pause was made to give her an opportunity of putting in an observation he is handsome but that is the least good about him he is the most noble man revered respected by everyone i may say loved the only one who could not appreciate him was his wife and we must assume that she did not by the ending that came however she could leave himhow she could even look at another after calling mr carlyle husbandwill always be a marvel to those who know him a bitter groanand it nearly escaped her lips that certainly is the pony carriage cried barbara bending her ear again if so how very early mr carlyle is home yes i am sure it is the sound of the wheels how lady isabel sat she scarcely knew how she concealed her trepidation she never would know a pause an entrance to the hall barbara baby in arms advanced to the drawingroom door and a tall form entered once more lady isabel was in the presence of her sometime husband he did not perceive that any one was present and he bent his head and fondly kissed his wife isabels jealous eyes were turned upon them she saw barbaras passionate lingering kiss in return she heard her fervent whispered greeting my darling and she watched him turn to press the same fond kisses on the rosy open lips of his child isabel flung her hand over her face had she bargained for this it was part of the cross she had undertaken to carry and she must bear it mr carlyle came forward and saw her he looked somewhat surprised madame vine said barbara and he held out his hand and welcomed her in the same cordial pleasant manner that his wife had done she put her shaking hand into his there was no help for it little thought mr carlyle that that hand had been tenderly clasped in his a thousand timesthat it was the one pledged to him at the altar of castle marling she sat down on her chair again unable to stand feeling as though every drop of blood within her had left her body it had certainly left her face mr carlyle made a few civil inquiries as to her journey but she did not dare to raise her eyes to his as she breathed forth the answers you are at home soon archibald said barbara addressing him i did not expect you so early i did not think you could get away do you know what i was wishing today she continued papa is going to london with squire pinner to see those new agricultural implementsor whatever it is they are sure to be away as much as three days i was thinking if we could but persuade mamma to come to us for the time papa is to be away it would be a delightful little change for hera break in her monotonous life i wish you could warmly spoke mr carlyle her life since you left is a monotonous one though in her gentle patience she will not say so it is a happy thought barbara and i only hope it may be carried out mrs carlyles mother is an invalid and lonely for she has no child at home with her now he added in a spirit of politeness addressing himself to madame vine she simply bowed her head trust herself to speak she did not mr carlyle scanned her face attentively as she sat her spectacles bent downward she did not appear inclined to be sociable and he turned to the baby who was wider awake than ever young sir i should like to know what brings you up and here at this hour you may well ask said barbara i just had him brought down as you were not here thinking he </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> he would be asleep directly and only look at himno more sleep in his eyes than there is in mine she would have hushed him to her as she spoke but the young gentleman stoutly repudiated it he set up a half cry and struggled his arms and head free again crowing the next moment most impudently mr carlyle took him it is no use barbara he is beyond your coaxing this evening and he tossed the child in his strong arms held him up to the chandelier made him bob at the baby in the pierglass until the rebel was in an ecstacy of delight finally he smothered his face with kisses as barbara had done barbara rang the bell oh can you imagine what it was for lady isabel so had he tossed so had he kissed her children she standing by the fond proud happy mother as barbara was standing now mr carlyle came up to her are you fond of these little troubles madame vine this one is a fine fellow they say very fine what is his name she replied by way of saying something arthur arthur archibald put in barbara to madame vine i was vexed that his name could not be entirely archibald but that was already monopolized is that you wilson i dont know what youll do with him but he looks as if he would not be asleep by twelve oclock wilson with a fresh satisfying of her curiosity by taking another prolonged stare from the corner of her eyes at madame vine received the baby from mr carlyle and departed with him madame vine rose would they excuse her she asked in a low tone she was tired and would be glad to retire to rest of course and anything she might wish in the way of refreshment would she ring for barbara shook hands with her in her friendly way and mr carlyle crossed the room to open the door for her and bowed her out with a courtly smile she went up to her chamber at once to rest well what think you she strove to say to her lacerated and remorseful heart that the crossfar heavier though it was proving than anything she had imagined or picturedwas only what she had brought upon herself and must bear very true but none of us would like such a cross to be upon our shoulders is she not droll looking cried barbara when she was alone with mr carlyle i cant think why she wears those blue spectacles it cannot be for her sight and they are very disfiguring she puts me in mind ofof began mr carlyle in a dreamy tone of whom her face i mean he said still dreaming so little can be seen of it resumed mrs carlyle of whom does she put you in mind i dont know nobody in particular returned he rousing himself let us have tea in barbara </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxiii the yearning of a breaking heart at her bedroom door the next morning stood lady isabel listening whether the coast was clear ere she descended to the gray parlor for she had a shrinking dread of encountering mr carlyle when he was glancing narrowly at her face the previous evening she had felt the gaze and it impressed upon her the dread of his recognition not only that he was the husband of another therefore it was not expedient that she should see too much of him for he was far dearer to her than he had ever been almost at the same moment there burst out of a remote roomthe nurseryan upright fair noble boy of some five years old who began careering along on the corridor astride upon a hearthbroom she did not need to be told it was her boy archibald his likeness to mr carlyle would have proclaimed it even if her heart had not in an impulse of unrestrainable tenderness she seized the child as he was galloping past her and carried him into her room broom and all you must let me make acquaintance with you she said to him by way of excuse i love little boys love down she sat upon a low chair the child held upon her lap kissing him passionately and the tears raining from her eyes she could not have helped the tears had it been to save her life she could as little have helped the kisses lifting her eyes there stood wilson who had entered without ceremony a sick feeling came over lady isabel she felt as if she had betrayed herself all that could be done now was to make the best of it to offer some lame excuse what possessed her thus to forget herself he did so put me in remembrance of my own children she said to wilson gulping down her emotion and hiding her tears in the best manner she could whilst the astonished archibald released now stood with his finger in his mouth and stared at her spectacles his great blue eyes opened to their utmost width when we have lost children of our own we are apt to love fondly all we come near wilson who stared only in a less degree than archie for she deemed the new governess had gone suddenly mad gave some voluble assent and turned her attention upon archie you naughty young monkey how dare you rush out in that way with sarahs heartbroom ill tell you what it is sir you are getting a might deal too owdacious and rumbustical for the nursery i shall speak to your mamma about it she seized hold of the child and shook him lady isabel started forward her hands up her voice one of painful entreaty oh dont dont beat him i cannot see him beaten beaten echoed wilson if he got a good beating it would be all the better for him but its what he never does get a little shake or a tap is all i must give and its not half enough you wouldnt believe the sturdy impudence of that boy madame he runs riot he does the other two never gave a quarter of the trouble come along you figure ill have a bolt put at the top of the nursery door and if i did hed be for climbing up the doorpost to get at it the last sentence wilson delivered to the governess as she jerked archie out of the room along the passage and into the nursery lady isabel sat down with a wrung heart a chafed spirit her own child and she might not say to the servant you shall not beat him she descended to the gray parlor the two older children and breakfast were waiting joyce quitted the room when she entered it a graceful girl of eight years old a fragile boy a year younger both bearing her once lovely featuresher once bright and delicate complexionher large soft brown eyes how utterly her heart yearned to them but there must be no scene like there had just been above nevertheless she stooped and kissed them bothone kiss each of impassioned fervor lucy was naturally silent william somewhat talkative you are our new governess said he yes we must be good friends why not said the boy we were good friends with miss manning i am to go into latin soonas soon as my coughs gone do you know latin nonot to teach it she said studiously avoiding all endearing epithets papa said you would be almost sure not to know latin for that ladies rarely did he said he should send up mr kane to teach me mr kane repeated lady isabel the name striking upon her memory mr kane the musicmaster how did you know he was a musicmaster cried shrewd william and lady isabel felt the red blood flush to her face at the unlucky admission she had made it flushed deeper at her own falsehood as she muttered some evasive words about hearing of him from mrs latimer yes he is a musicmaster but he does not get much money at it and he teaches the classics as well he has come up to teach us music since miss manning left mamma said that we ought not to lose our lessons mamma how the word applied to barbara grated on her ear whom does he teach she asked us two replied william pointing to his sister and himself do you always take bread and milk she inquired perceiving that to be what they were eating we get tired of it sometimes and then we have milk and water and bread and butter or honey and then we take to bread and milk again its aunt cornelia who thinks we should eat bread and milk for breakfast she says papa never had anything else when he was a boy lucy looked up papa would give me an egg when i breakfasted with him cried she and aunt cornelia said it was not good for me but papa gave it to me all the same i always had breakfast with him then and why do you not now asked lady isabel i dont know i have not since mamma came the word stepmother rose up rebelliously in the heart of lady isabel was mrs carlyle putting away the children from their father breakfast over she gathered them to her asking them various questions about their studies their hours of recreation the daily routine of their lives this is not the schoolroom you know cried william when she made some inquiry as to their books no the schoolroom is upstairs this is for our meals and for you in an evening the voice of mr carlyle was heard at this juncture in the hall and lucy was springing toward the sound lady isabel fearful lest he might enter if the child showed herself stopped her with a hurried hand stay here isabel her names lucy said william looking quickly up why do you call her isabel i thoughtthought i had heard her called isabel stammered the unfortunate lady feeling quite confused with the errors she was committing my name is isabel lucy said the child but i dont know who could have told you for i am never called isabel i have not been sincesinceshall i tell yousince mamma went away she concluded dropping her voice mamma that was you know did she go cried lady isabel full of emotion and possessing a very faint idea of what she was saying she was kidnapped whispered lucy kidnapped was the surprised answer yes or she would not have gone there was a wicked man on a visit to papa and he stole her wilson said she knew he was a kidnapper before he took mamma papa said i was never to be called isabel again but lucy isabel was mammas name how do you know papa said it dreamily returned lady isabel i heard him he said it to joyce and joyce told the servants i put only lucy to my copies i did put isabel lucy but papa saw it one day and he drew his pencil through isabel and told me to show it to miss manning after that miss manning let me put nothing but lucy i asked her why and she told me papa preferred the name and that i was not to ask questions she could not well stop the child but every word was rending her heart lady isabel was our very very own mamma pursued lucy this mamma is not do you love this one as you did the other breathed lady isabel oh i loved mammai loved mamma uttered lucy clasping her hands but its all over wilson said we must not love her any longer and aunt cornelia said it wilson said if she loved us she would not have gone away from us wilson said so resentfully spoke lady isabel she said she need not let that man kidnap her i am afraid he beat her for she died i lie in my bed at night and wonder whether he did beat her and what made her die it was after she died that our new mamma came home papa said that </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> that she was to be our mamma in place of lady isabel and we were to love her dearly do you love her almost passionately asked lady isabel lucy shook her head not as i loved mamma joyce entered to show the way to the schoolroom and they followed her upstairs as lady isabel stood at the window she saw mr carlyle depart on foot on his way to the office barbara was with him hanging fondly on his arm about to accompany him to the park gates so had she fondly hung so had she accompanied him in the days gone forever barbara came into the schoolroom in the course of the morning and entered upon the subject of their studies the different allotted hours some to play some to work she spoke in a courteous but decided tone showing that she was the unmistakable mistress of the house and children and meant to be never had lady isabel felt her position so keenlynever did it so gall and fret her spirit but she bowed to meek obedience a hundred times that day did she yearn to hold the children to her heart and a hundred times she had to repress the longing in a soft damask dress not unlike the color of the walls from which the room took its name a cap of honiton lace shading her delicate features sat mrs hare the justice was in london with squire pinner and barbara had gone to the grove and brought her mamma away in triumph it was evening now and mrs hare was paying a visit to the gray parlor miss carlyle had been dining there and lady isabel under plea of a violent headache had begged to decline the invitation to take tea in the drawingroom for she feared the sharp eyes of miss carlyle barbara upon leaving the desserttable went to the nursery as usual to her baby and mrs hare took the opportunity to go and sit a few minutes with the governessshe feared the governess must be very lonely miss carlyle scorning usage and ceremony had remained in the diningroom with mr carlyle a lecture for him upon some defalcation or other most probably in store lady isabel was alone lucy had gone to keep a birthday in the neighborhood and william was in the nursery mrs hare found her in a sad attitude her hands pressed upon her temples she had not yet made acquaintance with her beyond a minutes formal introduction i am sorry to hear you are not well this evening she gently said thank you my head aches muchwhich was no false plea i fear you must feel your solitude irksome it is dull for you to be here all alone i am so used to solitude mrs hare sat down and gazed with sympathy at the young though somewhat strangelooking woman before her she detected the signs of mental suffering on her face you have seen sorrow she uttered bending forward and speaking with the utmost sweetness oh great sorrow burst from lady isabel for her wretched fate was very palpable to her mind that evening and the tone of sympathy rendered it nearly irrepressible my daughter tells me that you have lost your children and you have lost your fortune and position indeed i feel for you i wish i could comfort you this did not decrease her anguish she completely lost all self control and a gush of tears fell from her eyes dont pity me dont pity me dear mrs hare indeed it only makes endurance harder some of us she added looking up with a sickly smile are born to sorrow we are all born to it cried mrs hare i in truth have cause to say so oh you know not what my position has beenthe terrible weight of grief that i have to bear for many years i can truly say that i have not known one completely happy moment all do not have to bear this killing sorrow said lady isabel rely upon it sorrow of some nature does sooner or later come to all in the brightest apparent lot on earth dark days must mix not that there is a doubt but that it falls unequally some as you observe seem born to it for it clings to them all their days others are more favoredas we reckon favor perhaps this great amount of trouble is no more than is necessary to take us to heaven you know the saying adversity hardens the heart or it opens it to paradise it may be that our hearts continue so hard that the longcontinued lifes trouble is requisite to soften them my dear mrs hare added in a lower tone while the tears glistened on her pale cheeks there will be a blessed rest for the weary when this toilsome life is ended let us find comfort in that thought ay ay murmured lady isabel it is all that is left to me you are young to have acquired so much experience of sorrow we cannot estimate sorrow by years we may live a whole lifetime of it in a single hour but we generally bring ill fate upon ourselves she continued in a desperation of remorse as our conduct is so will our happiness or misery be not always sighed mrs hare sorrow i grant you does come all too frequently from illdoing but the worst is the consequences of this illdoing fall upon the innocent as well as upon the guilty a husbands errors will involve his innocent wife parents sins fall upon their children children will break the hearts of their parents i can truly say speaking in all humble submission that i am unconscious of having deserved the great sorrow which came upon me that no act of mine invited it on but though it has nearly killed me i entertain no doubt that it is lined with mercy if i could only bring my weak rebellious heart to look for it you i feel sure have been equally undeserving she mrs hare marked not the flush of shame the drooping of the eyelids you have lost your little ones mrs hare resumed that is griefgreat grief i would not underrate it but believe me it is as nothing compared to the awful fate should it ever fall upon you of finding your children grow up and become that which makes you wish they had died in their infancy there are times when i am tempted to regret that all my treasures are not in that other world that they had not gone before me yes sorrow is the lot of all surely not of all dissented lady isabel there are some bright lots on earth there is not a lot but must bear its appointed share returned mrs hare bright as it may appear ay and as it may continue to be for years depend upon it some darkness must overshadow it earlier or later mr and mrs carlylewhat sorrow can there be in store for them asked lady isabel her voice ringing with a strange sound which mrs hare noted though she understood it not mrs carlyles lot is bright she said a sweet smile illumining her features she loves her husband with an impassioned love and he is worthy of it a happy fate indeed is hers but she must not expect to be exempted from sorrow mr carlyle has had his share of it continued mrs hare ah you have doubtless been made acquainted with his history his first wife left himleft home and her children he bore it bravely before the world but i know that it wrung his very heartstrings she was his hearts sole idol she not barbara the moment the word barbara had escaped her lips lady isabel recollected herself she was only madame vine the governess what would mrs hare think of her familiarity mrs hare did not appear to have noticed it she was absorbed in the subject barbara she uttered certainly not had his first love been given to barbara he would have chosen her then it was given to lady isabel it is given his wife now mrs hare nearly laughed of course it is would you wish it to be buried in the grave with the dead and with one who was false to him but my dear she was the sweetest woman that unfortunate lady isabel i loved her then and i cannot help loving her still others blamed her but i pitied they were well matched he so good and noble she so lovely and endearing and she left himthrew him to the winds with all his nobility and love exclaimed the poor governess with a gesture of the hands that looked very much like despair yes it will not do to talk ofit is a miserable subject how she could abandon such a husband such children was a marvel to many but to none more than it was to me and my daughter the false stepthough i feel almost ashamed to speak out the thought lest it may appear to savor of triumphwhile it must have secured her own wretchedness led to the happiness of my child for it is certain barbara would never love one as she loves mr carlyle it did secure wretchedness to her you think cried lady isabel her tone one of bitter mockery more than anything else mrs hare was surprised at the question no woman ever took that fatal step yet without its entailing on her the most dire wretchedness she replied it cannot be otherwise and lady isabel was of a nature to feel remorse beyond commonto meet it halfway refined modest with every feeling of an english gentlewoman she was the very last one would have thought to act so it was as if she had gone away in a dream not knowing what she was doing i have thought so many a time that terrible mental wretchedness and remorse did overtake her i know how did you know it did you hear it exclaimed lady isabel her tone all too eager had mrs hare been suspicious did he proclaim thatfrancis levison did you hear it from him mrs hare gentle mrs hare drew herself up for the words grated on her feelings and on her pride another moment and she was mild and kind again for she reflected that the poor sorrowful governess must have spoken without thought i know not what sir francis levison may have chose to proclaim she said but you may be sure he would not be allowed opportunity to proclaim anything to me or to any other friend of mr carlyles nay i should say nor to any of the good and honorable i heard it from lord mount severn from lord mount severn repeated lady isabel and she opened her lips to say something more but closed them again he was here on a visit in the summer he stayed a fortnight lady isabel was the daughter of the late earlperhaps you may not have known that helord mount severntold me in confidence that he had sought out lady isabel when the man levison left her he found her sick poor brokenhearted in some remote french town utterly borne down with remorse and repentance could it be otherwise sharply asked lady isabel my dear i have said it could not the very thought of her deserted children would entail it if nothing she did there was a baby born abroad added mrs hare dropping her voice an infant in its cradle lord mount severn said but that child we knew could only bring pain and shame true issued from her trembling lips next came her death and i cannot but think it was sent to her in mercy i trust she was prepared for it and had made her peace with god when all else is taken from us we turn to him i hope she had learned to find the refuge how did mr carlyle receive the news of her death murmured lady isabel a question which had been often in her thoughts i cannot tell he made no outward sign either of satisfaction or grief it was too delicate a subject for </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> for any one to enter upon with him and most assuredly he did not enter upon it himself after he was engaged to my child he told me he should never have married during lady isabels life fromfromthe remains of affection i should think not i inferred it to be from conscientious scruples all his affection is given to his present wife there is no doubt that he loves her with a true a fervent a lasting love though there may have been more romantic sentiment in the early passion felt for lady isabel poor thing she gave up a sincere heart a happy home ay poor thing she had very nearly wailed forth her vain despair i wonder whether the drawingroom is tenanted yet smiled mrs hare breaking a pause which had ensued if so i suppose they will be expecting me there i will ascertain for you said lady isabel speaking in the impulse of the moment for she was craving an instant to herself even though it were but in the next hall she quitted the gray parlor and approached the drawingroom not a sound came from it and believing it was empty she opened the door and looked cautiously in quite empty the fire blazed the chandelier was lighted but nobody was enjoying the warmth or the light from the inner room however came the sound of the piano and the tones of mr carlyles voice she recognized the chords of the musicthey were those of the accompaniment to the song he had so loved when she sang it him who was about to sing it to him now lady isabel stole across the drawingroom to the other door which was ajar barbara was seated at the piano and mr carlyle stood by her his arm on her chair and bending his face on a level with hers possibly to look at the music so once had stolen so once had peeped the unhappy barbara to hear this selfsame song she had been his wife then she had craved and received his kisses when it was over their positions were reversed barbara began her voice had not the brilliant power of lady isabels but it was a sweet and pleasant voice to listen to when other lips and other hearts their tales of love shall tell in language whose excess imparts the power they feel so well there may perhaps in such a scene some recollection be of days that have as happy been and youll remember me days that had as happy been ay did he remember her did a thought of her his first and best love flit across him as the words fell on his ear did a past vision of the time when she had sat there and sung it to him arouse his heart to even momentary recollection terribly indeed were their positions reversed most terribly was she feeling it and by whose act and will had the change been wrought barbara was now the cherished wife east lynnes mistress and what was she not even the courted welcomed guest of an hour as barbara had been but an interloper a criminal woman who had thrust herself into the house her act in doing so not justifiable her position a most false one was it right even if she did succeed in remaining undiscovered that she and barbara should dwell in the same habitation mr carlyle being in it did she deem it to be right no she did not but one act of illdoing entails more these thoughts were passing through her mind as she stood there listening to the song stood there as one turned to stone her throbbing temples pressed against the doors pillar the song was over and barbara turned to her husband a whole world of love in her bright blue eyes he laid his hand upon her head lady isabel saw that but she would not wait to see the caress that most probably followed it she turned and crossed the room again her hands clasped tightly on her bosom her breath catching itself in hysterical sobs miss carlyle was entering the hall they had not yet met and lady isabel swept meekly past her with a hurried courtesy miss carlyle spoke but she dared not answer to wait would have been to betray herself sunday came and that was the worst of all in the old east lynne pew at st judes so conspicuous to the congregation sat she as in former times no excuse dared she the governess make to remain away it was the first time she had entered an english protestant church since she had last sat in it there with mr carlyle can you wonder that the fact alone with all the terrible remembrances it brought in its train was sufficient to overwhelm her with emotion she sat at the upper end now with lucy barbara occupied the place that had been hers by the side of mr carlyle barbara there in her own right his wife she severed from him forever and forever she scarcely raised her head she tightened her thick veil over her face she kept her spectacles bent toward the ground lucy thought she must be crying she never had seen anyone so still at church before lucy was mistaken tears came not to solace the bitter anguish of hopeless selfcondemning remorse how she sat out the service she could not tell she could not tell how she could sit out other services as the sundays came round the congregation did not forget to stare at her what an extraordinary looking governess mrs carlyle had picked up they went out when it was over mr and mrs carlyle in advance she humbly following them with lucy she glanced aside at the tomb in the churchyards corner where moldered the remains of her father and a yearning cry went forth from the very depth of her soul oh that i were laid there with him why did i come back again to east lynne why truly but she had never thought that her cross would be so sharp as this </chapter>

here we stand like a pack of noodles conning over the incapables and passing by the right one continued sir john theres only one man amongst us fit to be our member whos that cried the meeting archibald carlyle a pause of consternationconsternation at their collective forgetfulnessand then a loud murmur of approaching to a shout filled the room archibald carlyle it should be no other if we can get him cried sir john he may decline you know the best thing all agreed was to act promptly a deputation half the length of the streetits whole length if you include the tagrag and bobtail that attended behindset off on the spur of the moment to the office of mr carlyle they found that gentleman about to leave it for the evening to return home to dinner for in the discussion of the allimportant topic the meeting had suffered time to run on to a late hour those gentlemen who dined at a somewhat earlier one had for once in their lives patiently allowed their dinners and their stomachs to waitwhich is saying a great deal for the patience of a justice mr carlyle was taken by surprise make me your member cried he merrily how do you know i should not sell you all well trust you carlyle too happy to do it i am not sure that i could spare the time deliberated mr carlyle now carlyle you must remember that you avowed to me no longer than last christmas your intention of going into parliament some time struck in mr justice herbert you cant deny it some timeyes replied mr carlyle but i did not say when i have no thoughts of it yet awhile you must allow us to put you in nominationyou must indeed mr carlyle theres nobody else fit for it as good send a pig to the house as some of us an extremely flattering reason for proposing to shift the honor upon me laughed mr carlyle well you know what we mean carlyle theres not a man in the whole county so suitable as you search it to the extremity of its boundariesyou must know there is not i dont know anything of the sort returned mr carlyle at any rate we shall do it for we have determined upon having you when you walk into west lynne tomorrow youll see the walks alive with placards carlyle forever suppose you allow me until tomorrow to consider of it and defer the garnishing of the walls a day later said mr carlyle a serious tone peeping out in the midst of his jocularity you do not fear the expenses it was but a glance he returned in answer as soon as the question had been putit was stupid old pinner who propounded itthey had felt how foolish it was and indeed the cost would be a mere nothing were there no opposition come decide now carlyle give us your promise if i decide now it will be in the negative replied mr carlyle it is a question that demands consideration give me till tomorrow for that and it is possible that i may accede to your request this was the best that could be made of him and the deputation backed out and as nothing more could be done departed to their several dinnertables mr dill who had been present remained rubbing his hands with satisfaction and casting admiring glances at mr carlyle whats the matter dill asked the latter you look as though you were pleased at this movement and assumed that i should accept it and so you will mr archibald and as to the looking pleased theres not a man woman or child in west lynne who wont do that dont make too sure dill of which sirof your becoming our member or of the people looking pleased of either laughed mr carlyle he quitted the office to walk home revolving the proposition as he did so that he had long thought of some time entering parliament was certain though no definite period of the when had fixed itself in his mind he saw not why he should confine his days entirely to toil to the work of his calling pecuniary considerations did not require it for his realized property combined with the fortune brought by barbara was quite sufficient to meet expenses according to their present style of living not that he had the least intention of giving up his business it was honorable as he conducted it and lucrative and he really liked it he would not have been condemned to lead an idle life for the world but there was no necessity for his being always at it mr dill made as good a principal as he did andif length of service and experience might </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> might be counteda better one he could safely be left to manage during the time it would be necessary for him mr carlyle to be in london he would rather represent west lynne than any other spot on the face of the earth no matter what might be the others importance and as west lynne was now in want of a member perhaps his opportunity had come that he would make a good and efficient public servant he believed his talents were superior his oratory persuasive and he had the gift of a true and honest spirit that he would have the interest of west lynne at heart was certain and he knew that he should serve his constituents to the very best of his power and ability they knew it also before mr carlyle had reached east lynne he had decided that it should be it was a fine spring evening the lilac was in bloom the hedges and trees were clothed in their early green and all things seemed full of promise even mr carlyles heart was rejoicing in the prospect opened to it he was sure he should like a public life but in the sanguine moments of realization or of hope some dark shade will step in to mar the brightness barbara stood at the drawingroom window watching for him not in her was the dark shade her dress was a marvel of vanity and prettiness and she had chosen to place on her fair hair a dainty headdress of laceas if her hair required any such ornament she waltzed up to mr carlyle when he entered and saucily held up her face the light of love dancing in her bright blue eyes what do you want he provokingly asked putting his hands behind him and letting her stand there oh wellif you wont say goodevening to me i have a great mind to say you should not kiss me for a week archibald he laughed who would be punished by that whispered he barbara pouted her pretty lips and the tears positively came into her eyes which is as much as to say it would be no punishment to you archibald dont you care for me he threw his arms around her and clasped her to his heart taking plenty of kisses then you know whether i care not he fondly whispered but now will you believe that that unfortunate lady isabel had been a witness to this well it was only what his greeting to her had once been her pale face flushed scarlet and she glided out of the room again as softly as she had entered it they had not seen her mr carlyle drew his wife to the window and stood there his arms round her waist barbara what should you say to living in london for a few months out of the twelve london i am very happy where i am why should you ask me that you are not going to live in london i am not sure of that i think i am for a portion of the year i have had an offer made me this afternoon barbara she looked at him wondering what he meantwondering whether he was serious an offer what sort of an offer of what nature could it be he smiled at her perplexity should you like to see m p attached to my name west lynne wants me to become its member a pause to take in the news a sudden rush of color and then she gleefully clasped her hands round his arm her eyes sparkling with pleasure oh archibald how glad i am i knew how you were appreciated and you will be appreciated more and more this is right it was not well for you to remain what you are for lifea private individual a country lawyer i am perfectly contented with my lot barbara he seriously said i am too busy to be otherwise i know that were you but a laboring man toiling daily for the bread you eat you would be contented feeling that you were fulfilling your appointed duty to the utmost she impulsively said but archibald can you not still be a busy man at west lynne although you do become its representative if i could not i should never accept the honor barbara for some few months of the year i must of necessity be in town but dill is an efficient substitute and i can run down for a week or so between times part of saturday sunday and part of monday i can always pass here if i please of course these changes have their drawbacks as well as their advantages where would be the drawbacks in this she interrupted well smiled mr carlyle in the first place i suppose you could not always be with me her hands fellher color faded oh archibald if i do become their member i must go up to town as soon as elected and i dont think it will do for my little wife to be quitting her home to travel about just now barbaras face wore a very blank look she could not dissent from mr carlyles reasoning and you must remain in london to the end of the session while i am here separated archibald she passionately added while the tears gushed into her eyes i could not live without you then what is to be done must i decline it decline it oh of course not i know we are looking on the dark side of things i can go very well with you for a monthperhaps two you think so i am sure so and mind you must not encourage mamma to talk me out of it archibald she continued resting her head upon his breast her sweet face turned up beseechingly to his you would rather have me with you would you not he bent his own down upon it what do you think about it my darling once morean opportune moment for her to enterlady isabel barbara heard her this time and sprang away from her husband mr carlyle turned round at the movement and saw madame vine she came forward her lips ashy her voice subdued six months now had she been at east lynne and had hitherto escaped detection time and familiarity render us accustomed to most thingsto danger among the rest and she had almost ceased to fear recognition livingso far as that point wentfar more peaceably than she had done at first she and the children were upon the best of terms she had greatly endeared herself to them she loved them and they loved herperhaps nature was asserting her own hidden claims she felt very anxious about william he seemed to grow weaker and she determined to make her fears known to mr carlyle she quitted the parlor she had heard mr carlyle come in crossing the hall she tapped softly at the drawingroom door and then as softly entered it was the moment of mr carlyles loud greeting to his wife they stood together heedless of her gliding out again she paced the hall her hands pressed upon her beating heart how dared that heart rise up in sharp rebellion at these witnessed tokens of love was barbara not his wife had she not a legal claim to all his tenderness who was she that she should resent them in her jealousy what though they had once been hers hers only had she not signed and sealed her own forfeit of them and so made room for barbara back to the gray parlor there she stood her elbow on the mantelpiece her eyes hidden by her hand thus she remained for some minutes and lucy thought how sad she looked but lucy felt hungry and was casting longing glances to the teatable she wondered how long her governess meant to keep it waiting madame vine cried she presently dont you know that tea is ready this caused madame vine to raise her eyes they fell on the pale boy at her feet she made no immediate answer only placed her hand on lucys shoulder oh lucy dear ii have many sorrows to bear the tea will warm you and there is some nice jam was miss lucys offered consolation their greeting tender as it may be is surely over by this time thought lady isabel an expression something like mockery curving her lips i will venture again only to see him with his wifes face on his breast and his lips bent upon it but they had heard her this time and she had to advance in spite of her spirit of misery and her whitened features would you be so good sir as to come and look at william she asked in a low tone of mr carlyle certainly what for interjected barbara he looks very ill i do not like his looks i am fearing whether he can be worse than we have thought they went to the gray parlor all three of them mr carlyle was in first and had taken a long silent look at william before the others entered what is he doing on the floor exclaimed barbara in her astonishment he should not lie on the floor madame vine he lays himself down there at the dusk hour and i cannot get him up again i try to persuade him to use the sofa but it is of no use the floor will not hurt him said mr carlyle this was the dark shade his boys failing health william opened his eyes whos thatpapa dont you feel well william oh yes im very well but i am tired why do you lie down here i like lying here papa that pretty white rabbit of mine is dead indeed suppose you get up and tell me all about it i dont know about it myself yet said william softly rising the gardener told lucy when she was out just now i did not go i was tired he said what has tired you interrupted mr carlyle taking hold of the boys hand oh nothing i am always tired do you tell mr wainwright that you are tired no why should i tell him i wish he would not order me to take that nasty medicine that cod liver oil but it is to make you strong my boy it makes me sick i always feel sick after it papa madame vine says i ought to have cream that would be nice cream repeated mr carlyle turning his eyes on madame vine i have known cream to do a great deal of good in a case like williams she observed i believe that no better medicine can be given that it has in fact no substitute it can be tried said mr carlyle pray give your orders madame vine for anything you think may be beneficial to him mrs carlyle added you have had more experience with children than i joyce what does wainwright say interrupted mr carlyle speaking to his wife in his low tone i do not always see him when he comes archibald madame vine does i believe oh dear cried lucy cant we have tea i want some bread and jam mr carlyle turned round smiled and nodded at her patience is good for little girls miss lucy would you like some bread and jam my boy william shook his head i cant eat jam i am only thirsty mr carlyle cast a long and intent look at him and then left the room lady isabel followed him her thoughts full of her ailing child do you think him very ill sir she whispered i think he looks so what does mr wainwright say he says nothing to me i have not inquired his true condition until tonight it did not come to me that there was any apprehension does he look so much worse tonight not any worse than customary latterly he had looked just like this in the evening it was a remark of hannahs that roused my alarm she thinks he is on the road to death what can we do to save him she clasped her hands as she spoke in the intensity of her emotion </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> emotion she almost forgot as they stood there together talking of the welfare of the child their child that he was no longer her husband almost not quite utterly impossible would it be for her wholly to forget the dreadful present neither he nor the child could again belong to her in this world a strange rising of the throat in her wild despair a meek courtesy as she turned from him his last words ringing in her ears i shall call in further advice for him madame vine william was clinging round mrs carlyle in a coaxing attitude when she reentered the gray parlor i know what i could eat mamma if youd let me have it cried he in answer to her remonstrance that he must eat something what could you eat some cheese cheese cheese with tea laughed mrs carlyle for the last week or two he has fancied strange things the effect of a diseased appetite exclaimed madame vine but if i allow them to be brought in he barely tastes them i am sure mamma i could eat some cheese now said william you may have it answered mrs carlyle as she turned to leave the room the impatient knock and ring of a visitor was heard barbara wondered who could be arriving at that their dinner hour sailing majestically into the hall her lips compressed her aspect threatening came miss carlyle now it turned out that miss corny had been standing at her own window grimly eyeing the ill doings of the street from the fine housemaid opposite who was enjoying a flirting interview with the baker to the ragged urchins pitchpolling in the gutter and the dust and there she caught sight of the string justices and others who came flowing out of the office of mr carlyle so many of them were they that miss corny involuntarily thought of a conjuror flinging flowers out of a hatthe faster they come the more it seems there are to come what on earth is up cried miss corny pressing her nose flat against the pane that she might see better they filed off some one way some another miss carlyles curiosity was keener than her appetite for she stayed on the watch although just informed that her dinner was served presently mr carlyle appeared and she knocked at the window with her knuckles he did not hear it he had turned off at a quick pace toward home miss cornys temper rose the clerks came out next one after another and the last was mr dill he was less hurried than mr carlyle had been and heard miss cornys signal what in the name of wonder did all that stream of people want at the office began she when mr dill had entered in obedience to it that was the deputation miss cornelia what deputation the deputation to mr archibald they want him to become their new member member of what cried she not guessing at the actual meaning of parliament miss corny to replace mr attley the gentlemen came to solicit him to be put in nomination solicit a donkey irascibly uttered miss corny for the tidings did not meet her approbation did archibald turn them out again he gave them no direct answer maam he will consider of it between now and tomorrow morning consider of it shrieked she why hed never never be such a flat as to comply he go into parliament what next why should he not miss corny im sure i should be proud to see him there miss corny gave a sniff you are proud of things more odd than even john dill remember that fine shirt front what has become of it is it laid up in lavender not exactly in lavender miss corny it lies in the drawer for i have never liked to put it on since after what you said why dont you sell it at halfprice and buy a couple of good useful ones with the money returned she tartly better that than keep the foppish thing as a witness of your folly perhaps hell be buying embroidered fronts next if he goes into that idle donothing house of commons id rather enter myself for six months at the treadmill oh miss corny i dont think you have well considered it its a great honor and worthy of him he will be elevated above us all as it were and he deserves to be elevate him on a weathercock raged miss corny there you may go ive heard quite enough brushing past the old gentleman leaving him to depart or not as he might please miss carlyle strode upstairs flung on her shawl and bonnet and strode down again her servant looked considerably surprised and addressed her as she crossed the hall your dinner maam he ventured to say whats my dinner to you returned miss corny in her wrath you have had yours away she strode and thus it happened that she was at east lynne almost as soon as mr carlyle wheres archibald began she without ceremony the moment she saw barbara he is here is anything the matter mr carlyle hearing the voice came out and she pounced upon him with her tongue whats this about your becoming the new member for west lynne west lynne wishes it said mr carlyle sit down cornelia sit down yourself retorted she keeping on her feet i want my question answered of course you will decline on the contrary i have made up my mind to accept miss corny untied the strings of her bonnet and flung them behind her have you counted the cost she asked and there was something quite sepulchral in her solemn tone i have given it consideration cornelia both as regards money and time the expenses are not worth naming should there be no opposition and if there is any ay groaned miss corny if there is well i am not without a few hundred to spare for the playing he said turning upon her the goodhumored light of his fine countenance miss carlyle emitted some dismal groans that ever i should have lived to see this day to hear money talked of as though it were dirt and whats to become of your business she sharply added is that to be let run to rack and ruin while you are kicking up your heels in that wicked london under plea of being at the house night after night cornelia he gravely said were i dead dill could carry on the business just as well as it is being carried on now i might go into a foreign country for seven years and come back to find the business as flourishing as ever for dill could keep it together and even were the business to drop offthough i tell you it will not do soi am independent of it miss carlyle faced tartly round upon barbara have you been setting him on to this i think he had made up his mind before he spoke to me but added barbara in her truth i urged him to accept it oh you did nicely moped and miserable youll be here if he goes to london for months on the stretch you did not think of that perhaps but he would not have me here said barbara her eyelashes becoming wet at the thought as she unconsciously moved to her husbands side he would take me with him miss carlyle made a pause and looked at them alternately is that decided she asked of course it is laughed mr carlyle willing to joke the subject and his sister into goodhumor would you wish to separate man and wife cornelia she made no reply she rapidly tied her bonnetstrings the ribbons trembling ominously in her fingers you are not going cornelia you must stay to dinner now that you are hereit is readyand we will talk this further over afterward this has been dinner enough for me for one day spoke she putting on her gloves that i should have lived to see my fathers son throw up his business and change himself into a lazy stuckup parliament man do stay and dine with us cornelia i think i can subdue your prejudices if you will let me talk to you if you wanted to talk to me about it why did you not come in when you left the office cried miss corny in a greater amount of wrath than she had shown yet and theres no doubt that in his not having done so lay one of the sore points i did not think of it said mr carlyle i should have come in and told you of it tomorrow morning i dare say you would she ironically answered good evening to you both and in spite of their persuasions she quitted the house and went stalking down the avenue two or three days more and the address of mr carlyle to the inhabitants of west lynne appeared in the local papers while the walls and posts convenient were embellished with various colored placards vote for carlyle carlyle forever wonders never cease surprises are the lot of man but perhaps a greater surprise had never been experienced by those who knew what was what than when it went forth to the world that sir francis levison had converted himself fromfrom what he wasinto a redhot politician had he been offered the post of prime minister or did his conscience smite him as was the case with a certain gallant captain renowned in song neither the one nor the other the simple fact was that sir francis levison was in a state of pecuniary embarrassment and required something to prop him upsome snug sinecureplenty to get and nothing to do patch himself up he must but how he had tried the tables but luck was against him he made a desperate venture upon the turf a grand coup that would have set him on his legs for some time but the venture turned out the wrong way and sir francis was a defaulter he began then to think there was nothing for it but to drop into some nice government nest where as i have told you there would be plenty to get and nothing to do any place with much to do would not suit him or he it he was too emptyheaded for work requiring talent you may have remarked that a man given to sir francis levisons pursuits generally is he dropped into something good or that promised goodnothing less than the secretaryship to lord headthelot who swayed the ministers in the upper house but that he was a connection of lord headthelots he never would have obtained it and very dubiously the minister consented to try him of course a condition was that he should enter parliament the first opportunity his vote to be at the disposal of the ministryrather a shaky ministryand supposed by some to be on its last legs and this brings us to the present time in a handsome drawingroom in eaton square one sunny afternoon sat a lady young and handsome her eyes were of violet blue her hair was auburn her complexion delicate but there was a stern look of anger amounting to sullenness on her wellformed features and her pretty foot was beating the carpet in passionate impatience it was lady levison the doings of the past had been coming home to her for some time nowpast doings be they good or be they ill are sure to come home one day or another and bring their fruits with them in the years pastmany years past nowfrancis levison had lost his heartor whatever the thing might be that with him did duty for oneto blanche challoner he had despised her once to lady isabelas lord thomas says in the old ballad but that was done to suit his own purpose for he had never at any period cared for lady isabel as he had cared for blanche he gained her affection in secretthey engaged themselves to each other blanches sister lydia challoner two years older than herself suspected it and taxed blanche with it blanche true to her compact of keeping it a secret </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> secret denied it with many protestations she did not care for captain levison rather disliked him in fact so much the better was miss challoners reply for she had no respect for captain levison and deemed him an unlikely man to marry years went on and poor unhappy blanche challoner remained faithful to her love he played fast and loose with herprofessing attachment for her in secret and visiting at the house perhaps he feared an outbreak from her an exposure that might be anything but pleasant did he throw off all relations between them blanche summoned up her courage and spoke to him urging the marriage she had not yet glanced at the fear that his intention of marrying her had he ever possessed such was over bad men are always cowards sir francis shrank from an explanation and so far forgot honor as to murmur some indistinct promise that the wedding should be speedy lydia challoner had married and been left a widow well off she was mrs waring and at her house resided blanche for the girls were orphans blanche was beginning to show symptoms of her nearly thirty years not the years but the longcontinued disappointment the heartburnings were telling upon her her hair was thin her face was pinched her form had lost its roundness marry her indeed scoffed to himself sir francis levison there came to mrs warings upon a christmas visit a younger sister alice challoner a fair girl of twenty years she resided generally with an aunt in the country far more beautiful was she than blanche had ever been and francis levison who had not seen her since she was a child fellas he would have called itin love with her love he became her shadow he whispered sweet words in her ear he turned her head giddy with its own vanity and he offered her marriage she accepted him and preparations for the ceremony immediately began sir francis urged speed and alice was nothing loth and what of blanche blanche was stunned a despairing stupor took possession of her and when she woke from it desperation set in she insisted upon an interview with sir francis and evade it he could not though he tried hard will it be believed that he denied the pastthat he met with mocking suavity her indignant reminders of what had been between them love marriage nonsense her fancy had been too much at work finally he defied her to prove that he had regarded her with more than ordinary friendship or had ever hinted at such a thing as a union she could not prove it she had not so much as a scrap of paper written on by him she had not a single friend or enemy to come forward and testify that they heard him breathe to her a word of love he had been too wary for that moreover there was her own solemn protestations to her sister lydia that there was not anything between her and francis levison who would believe her if she veered round now and avowed these protestations were false no she found that she was in a sinking ship one there was no chance of saving but one chance did she determine to tryan appeal to alice blanche challoners eyes were suddenly and rudely opened to the badness of the man and she was aware now how thoroughly unfit he was to become the husband of her sister it struck her that only misery could result from the union and that if possible alice should be saved from entering upon it would she have married him herself then yes but it was a different thing for that fair fresh young alice she had not wasted her lifes best years in waiting for him when the family had gone to rest and the house was quiet blanche challoner proceeded to her sisters bedroom alice had not begun to undress she was sitting in a comfortable chair before the fire her feet on the fender reading a love letter from sir francis alice i am come to tell you a story she said quietly will you hear it in a minute stop a bit replied alice she finished the perusal of the letter put it aside and then spoke again what did you say blanche a story blanche nodded several years ago there was a fair young girl none too rich in our station of life a gentleman who was none too rich either sought and gained her love he could not marry he was not rich i say they loved on in secret hoping for better times she wearing out her years and her heart oh alice i cannot describe to you how she loved himhow she has continued to love him up to this moment through evil report she clung to him tenaciously and tenderly as the vine clings to its trellis for the world spoke ill of him who was the young lady interrupted alice is this a fable of romance blanche or a real history a real history i knew her all those yearsyears and years i sayhe kept leading her on to love letting her think that his love was hers in the course of time he succeeded to a fortune and the bar to their marriage was over he was abroad when he came into it but returned home at once their intercourse was renewed and her fading heart woke up once more to life still the marriage did not come on he said nothing of it and she spoke to him very soon now should it be was his answer and she continued to live onin hope go on blanche cried alice who had grown interested in the tale never suspecting that it could bear a personal interest yes i will go on would you believe alice that almost immediately after this last promise he saw one whom he fancied he should like better and asked her to be his wife forsaking the one to whom he was bound by every tie of honorrepudiating all that had been between them even his own words and promises how disgraceful were they married they are to be would you have such a man i returned alice quite indignant at the question it is not likely that i would that man alice is sir francis levison alice challoner gave a start and her face became scarlet how dare you say so blanche it is not true who was the girl pray she must have traduced him she has not traduced him was the subdued answer the girl was myself an awkward pause i know cried alice throwing back her head resentfully he told me i might expect something of thisthat you had fancied him in love with you and were angry because he had chosen me blanche turned upon her with streaming eyes she could no longer control her emotion alice my sister all the pride is gone out of me all the reticence that woman loves to observe as to her wrongs and her inward feelings i have broken through for you this night as sure as there is a heaven above us i have told you the truth until you came i was engaged to francis levison an unnatural scene ensued blanche provoked at alices rejection of her words told all the ill she knew or heard of the man she dwelt upon his conduct with regard to lady isabel carlyle his heartless aftertreatment of that unhappy lady alice was passionate and fiery she professed not to believe a word of her sisters wrongs and as to the other stories they were no affairs of hers she said what had she to do with his past life but alice challoner did believe her sisters earnestness and distress as she told the tale carried conviction with them she did not very much care for sir francis he was not entwined round her heart as he was round blanches but she was dazzled with the prospect of so good a settlement in life and she would not give him up if blanche broke her heartwhy she must break it but she need not have mixed taunts and jeers with her refusal to believe she need not have triumphed openly over blanche was it well done was it the work of an affectionate sister as we sow so shall we reap she married sir francis levison leaving blanche to her broken heart or to any other calamity that might grow out of the injustice and there sat lady levison now her three years of marriage having served to turn her love for sir francis into contempt and hate a little boy two years old the only child of the marriage was playing about the room his mother took no notice of him she was buried in allabsorbing thoughtthought which caused her lips to contract and her brow to scowl sir francis entered his attitude lounging his air listless lady levison roused herself but no pleasant manner of tone was hers as she set herself to address him i want some money she said so do i he answered an impatient stamp of the foot and a haughty toss and i must have it i must i told you yesterday that i must do you suppose i can go on without a sixpence of ready money day after day do you suppose it is of any use to put yourself in this fury retorted sir francis a dozen times a week do you bother me for money and a dozen times do i tell you i have got none i have got none for myself you may as well ask that baby for money as ask me i wish he had never been born passionately uttered lady levison unless he had had a different father that the last sentence and the bitter scorn of its tone would have provoked a reprisal from sir francis his flashing countenance betrayed but at that moment a servant entered the room i beg your pardon sir that man brown forced his way into the hall and i cant see himi wont see him interrupted sir francis backing to the furthest corner of the room in what looked very like abject terror as if he had completely lost his presence of mind lady levisons lips curled we got rid of him sir after a dreadful deal of trouble i was about to say but while the door was open in the dispute mr meredith entered he has gone into the library sir and vows he wont stir till he sees you whether you are sick or well a moments pause a halfmuttered oath and the sir francis quitted the room the servant retired and lady levison caught up her child oh franky dear she wailed forth burying her face in his warm neck id leave him for good and all if i dared but i fear he might keep you now the secret was that for the last three days sir francis had been desperately ill obliged to keep his bed and could see nobody his life depending upon quiet such was the report or something equivalent to it which had gone in to lord headthelot or rather to the official office for that renowned chief was himself out of town it had also been delivered to all callers at sir francis levisons house the royal truth being that sir francis was as well as you or i but from something that had transpired touching one of his numerous debts did not dare to show himself that morning the matter had been arrangedpatched up for a time my stars levison began mr meredith who was a whipperin of the ministry what a row there is about you why you look as well as ever you were a great deal better today coughed sir francis to think that you should have chosen the present moment for skulking here have i been dancing attendance at your door day after day in a state of incipient fever enough to put me into a real one and could neither get admitted nor a letter taken up i should have blown the house up today and got in amidst the flying debris </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> debris by the way are you and my lady two just now two growled sir francis she was stepping into her carriage yesterday when they turned me from the door and i made inquiry of her her ladyships answer was that she knew nothing either of francis or his illness her ladyship is subject to flights of distemper chafed sir francis what desperate need have you of me just now headthelots away and theres nothing doing nothing doing up here a deal too much doing somewhere else attleys seats in the market well and you ought to have been down there about it three or four days ago of course you must step into it of course i shant returned sir francis to represent west lynne will not suit me not suit you west lynne why of all places it is most suitable its close to your own property if you call ten miles close i shall not put up for west lynne meredith headthelot came up this morning said mr meredith the information somewhat aroused sir francis headthelot what brings him back you i tell you levison theres a hot row headthelot expected you would be at west lynne days past and he has come up in an awful rage every additional vote we can count in the house is worth its weight in gold and you he says are allowing west lynne to slip through your fingers you must start for it at once levison sir francis mused had the alternative been given him he would have preferred to represent a certain warm place underground rather than west lynne but to quit headthelot and the snug post he anticipated would be ruin irretrievable nothing short of outlawry or the queens prison it was awfully necessary to get his threatened person into parliament and he began to turn over in his mind whether he could bring himself to make further acquaintance with west lynne the thing must have blown over for good by this time was the result of his cogitations unconsciously speaking aloud i can understand your reluctance to appear at west lynne cried mr meredith the scene unless i mistake of that notorious affair of yours but private feelings must give way to public interests and the best thing you can do is to start headthelot is angry enough as it is he says had you been down at first as you ought to have been you would have slipped in without opposition but now there will be a contest sir francis looked up sharply a contest who is going to stand the funds pshaw as if we should let funds be any barrier have you heard who is in the field no was the apathetic answer carlyle carlyle uttered sir francis startled oh by george though i cant stand against him well theres the alternative if you cant thornton will i should run no chance west lynne would not elect me in preference to him im not sure indeed that west lynne would have me in any case nonsense you know our interest there government put in attley and it can put you in yes or no levison yes answered sir francis an hours time and sir francis levison went forth on his way to be conveyed to west lynne not yet he turned his steps to scotland yard in considerably less than an hour the following telegram marked secret went down from the head office to the superintendent of police at west lynne is otway bethel at west lynne if not where is he and when will he be returning to it it elicited a prompt answer otway bethel is not at west lynne supposed to be in norway movements uncertain </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxv a mishap to the blue spectacles mr carlyle and barbara were seated at breakfast when somewhat to their surprise mr dill was shown in following close upon his heels came justice hare and close upon his heels came squire pinner while bringing up the rear was colonel bethel all the four had come up separately not together and all four were out of breath as if it had been a race which should arrive soonest quite impossible was it for mr carlyle at first to understand the news they brought all were talking at once in the utmost excitement and the fury of justice hare alone was sufficient to produce temporary deafness mr carlyle caught a word of the case presently a second man opposition well let him come on he goodhumoredly cried we shall have the satisfaction of ascertaining who wins in the end but you have not heard who it is mr archibald cried old dill it stand a contest with him raved justice hare he the fellow wants hanging interjected colonel bethel couldnt he be ducked suggested squire pinner now all these sentences were ranted out together and their respective utterers were fain to stop till the noise subsided a little barbara could only look from one to the other in astonishment who is this formidable opponent asked mr carlyle there was a pause not one of them but had the delicacy to shrink from naming that man to mr carlyle the information came at last from old dill who dropped his voice while he spoke it mr archibald the candidate who has come forward is that man levison of course carlyle youll go into it now neck and crop cried justice hare mr carlyle was silent you wont let the beast frighten you from the contest uttered colonel bethel in a loud tone theres a meeting at the bucks head at ten said mr carlyle not replying to the immediate question i will be with you there did you not say mr dill that was where the scoundrel levison isat the bucks head he was there answered mr dill i expect he is ousted by this time i asked the landlord what he thought of himself for taking in such a character and what he supposed the justice would say to him he vowed with tears in his eyes that the fellow should not be there another hour and that he should never have entered it had he known who he was a little more conversation and the visitors filed off mr carlyle sat down calmly to finish his breakfast barbara approached him archibald you will not suffer this mans insolent doings to deter you from your plansyou will not withdraw she whispered i think not barbara he has thrust himself offensively upon me in this measure i believe my better plan will be to take no more heed of him than i should of the dirt under my feet rightright she answered a proud flush deepening the rose on her cheeks mr carlyle was walking into west lynne there were the placards sure enough side by side with his own bearing the name of that wicked coward who had done him the greatest injury one man can do to another verily he must possess a face of brass to venture there archibald have you heard the disgraceful news the speaker was miss carlyle who had come down upon her brother like a ship with all sails set her cheeks wore a flush her eyes glistened her tall form was drawn up to its most haughty height i have heard it cornelia and had i not the walls would have enlightened me is he out of his mind out of his reckoning i fancy replied mr carlyle you will carry on the contest now she continued her countenance flashing i was averse to it before but i now withdraw all my objection you will be no brother of mine if you yield the field to him i do not intend to yield it good you bear on upon your course and let him crawl on upon his take no more heed of him than if he were a viper archibald you must canvass now no said mr carlyle i shall be elected without canvass youll see cornelia there will be plenty canvassing for you if you dont condescend to take the trouble my indifferent brother ill give a thousand pounds myself for ale to the electors take care laughed mr carlyle keep your thousand pounds in your pocket cornelia i have no mind to be unseated on the plea of bribery and corruption heres sir john dobede galloping in with a face as red as the sun in a fog well it may be he has heard the news i can tell you archibald west lynne is in a state of excitement that has not been its lot for many a day miss carlyle was right excitement and indignation had taken possession of west lynne how the people rallied around mr carlyle town and country were alike up in arms but government interest was rife at west lynne and whatever the private and public feeling might be collectively or individually many votes should be recorded for sir francis levison one of the first to become cognizant of the affair was lord mount severn he was at his club one evening in london poring over an evening paper when the names carlyle west lynne caught his view knowing that mr carlyle had been named as the probable member and heartily wishing that he might become such the earl naturally read the paragraph he read it and read it again he rubbed his eyes he rubbed his glasses he pinched himself to see whether he was awake or dreaming for believe what that paper assertedthat sir francis levison had entered the lists in opposition to mr carlyle and was at west lynne busily canvassinghe could not do you know anything of this infamous assertion he inquired of an intimate friendinfamous whether true or false its true i heard of it an hour ago plenty of cheek that levison must have cheek repeated the dismayed earl feeling as if every part of him body and mind were outraged by the news dont speak of it in that way the hound deserves to be gibbeted he threw aside the paper quitted the club returned home for a carpet bag and went shrieking and whistling down to west lynne taking his son with him or if he did not whistle and shriek the engine did fully determined was the earl of mount severn to show his opinion of the affair on these fine spring mornings their breakfast over lady isabel was in the habit of going into the grounds with the children they were on the lawn before the house when two gentlemen came walking up the avenue or rather one gentleman and a handsome young stripling growing into another lady isabel thought she should have dropped for she stood face to face with lord mount severn the earl stopped to salute the children and raised his hat to the strange lady it is my governess madame vine said lucy a silent courtesy from madame vine she turned away her head and gasped for breath is your papa at home lucy cried the earl yes i think he is at breakfast im so glad you are come lord mount severn walked on holding william by the hand who had eagerly offered to take him to papa lord vane bent over lucy to kiss her a little while a very few more years and my young lady would not hold up her rosy lips so boldly you have grown a dearer girl than ever lucy have you forgotten our compact no laughed she and you will not forget it never said the child shaking her head you shall see if i do lucy is to be my wife cried he turning to madame vine it is a bargain and we have both promised i mean to wait for her till she is old enough i like her better than anybody else in the world and i like him spoke up miss lucy and its all true lucy was a childit may almost be said an infantand the viscount was not of an age to render important such avowed passions nevertheless the words did thrill through the veins of the hearer she spoke she thought not as madame vine would have spoken and thought but as the unhappy mother the illfated </highSuspense1> <highSuspense1> illfated lady isabel you must not say these things to lucy it could never be lord vane laughed why asked he your father and mother would not approve my father wouldi know he would he likes lucy as to my motheroh well she cant expect to be master and mistress too you be off for a minute lucy i want to say some thing to madame vine has carlyle shot that fellow he continued as lucy sprung away my father is so stiff especially when hes put up that he would not sully his lips with the name or make a single inquiry when we arrived neither would he let me and i walked up here with my tongue burning she would have responded what fellow but she suspected too well and the words died away on her unwilling lips that brute levison if carlyle riddled his body with shots for this move and then kicked him till he died hed only get his deserts and the world would applaud he oppose carlyle i wish i had been a man a few years ago hed have got a shot through his heart then i say dropping his voice did you know lady isabel yesnoyes she was at a loss what to sayalmost as unconscious what she did say she was lucys mother you know and i loved her i think thats why i love lucy for she is the very image of her where did you know her here i knew her by hearsay murmured lady isabel arousing to recollection oh hearsay has carlyle shot the beast or is he on his legs yet by jove to think that he should sneak himself up in this way at west lynne you must apply elsewhere for information she gasped i know nothing of these things she turned away with a beating heart and took lucys hand and departed lord vane set off on a run toward the house his heels flying behind him and now the contest began in earnestthat is the canvass sir francis levison his agent and a friend from town who as it turned out instead of being some great gun of the government was a private chum of the baronets by name drake sneaked about the town like dogs with their tails burnt for they were entirely alive to the color in which they were held their only attendants being a few young gentlemen and ladies in rags who commonly brought up the rear the other party presented a stately crowdcounty gentry magistrates lord mount severn sometimes mr carlyle would be with them armandarm with the latter if the contesting groups came within view of each other and were likely to meet the brave sir francis would disappear down an entry behind a hedge any place convenient with all his face of brass he could not meet mr carlyle and that condemning jury around him one afternoon it pleased mrs carlyle to summon lucy and the governess to accompany her into west lynne she was going shopping lady isabel had a dread and horror of appearing in there while that man was in town but she could not help herself there was no pleading illness for she was quite well there must be no saying i will not go for she was only a dependant they started and had walked as far as mrs hares gate when miss carlyle turned out of it your mammas not well barbara is she not cried barbara with quick concern i must go and see her she has had one of those ridiculous dreams again pursued miss carlyle ignoring the presence of the governess and lucy i was sure of it by her very look when i got in shivering and shaking and glancing fearfully around as if she feared a dozen spectres were about to burst out of the walls so i taxed her with it and she could make no denial richard is in some jeopardy she protests or will be and there she is shaking still although i told her that people who put faith in dreams were only fit for a lunatic asylum barbara looked distressed she did not believe in dreams any more than miss carlyle but she could not forget how strangely peril to richard had supervened upon some of these dreams i will go in now and see mamma she said if you are returning home cornelia madame vine can walk with you and wait for me there let me go in with you mamma pleaded lucy barbara mechanically took the childs hand the gates closed on them and miss carlyle and lady isabel proceeded in the direction of the town but not far had they gone when in turning a corner the wind which was high blew away with the veil of lady isabel and in raising her hand in trepidation to save it before it was finally gone she contrived to knock off her blue spectacles they fell to the ground and were broken how did you manage that uttered miss carlyle how indeed she bent her face on the ground looking at the damage what should she do the veil was over the hedge the spectacles were brokenhow could she dare show her naked face that face was rosy just then as in former days the eyes were bright and miss carlyle caught their expression and stared in very amazement good heavens above she uttered what an extraordinary likeness and lady isabels heart turned faint and sick within her well it might and to make matters worse bearing down right upon them but a few paces distant came sir francis levison would he recognize her standing blowing in the wind at the turning of the road were miss carlyle and lady isabel vane the latter confused and perplexed was picking up the remnant of her damaged spectacles the former little less perplexed gazed at the face which struck upon her memory as being so familiar her attention however was called off the face to the apparition of sir francis levison he was close upon them mr drake and the other comrade being with him and some tagrag in attendance as usual it was the first time he and miss carlyle had met face to face she bent her condemning brow haughty in its bitter scorn full upon him for it was not in the nature of miss carlyle to conceal her sentiments especially when they were rather of the strongest sir francis when he arrived opposite raised his hat to her whether it was done in courtesy in confused unconsciousness or in mockery cannot be told miss carlyle assumed it to have been the latter and her lips in their anger grew almost as pale as those of the unhappy woman who was cowering behind her did you intend that insult for me francis levison as you please to take it returned he calling up insolence to his aid you dare to lift off your hat to me have you forgotten that i am miss carlyle it would be difficult for you to be forgotten once seen now this answer was given in mockery his tone and manner were redolent of it insolently so the two gentlemen looked on in discomfort wondering what it meant lady isabel hid her face as best she could terrified to death lest his eyes should fall on it while the spectators several of whom had collected now listened with interest especially some farm laborers of squire pinners who had happened to be passing you contemptible worm cried miss carlyle do you think you can outrage me with impunity as you by your presence in it are outraging west lynne out upon you for a bold bad man now miss corny in so speaking had certainly no thought of present and immediate punishment for the gentleman but it appeared that the mob around had the motion was commented by those stoutshouldered laborers whether excited thereto by the words of miss carlylewho whatever may have been her faults of manner held the respect of the neighborhood and was looked up to only in a less degree than her brother whether squire pinner their master had let drop in their hearing a word of the ducking he had hinted at when at east lynne or whether their own feelings alone spurred them on was best known to the men themselves certain it is that the ominous sound of duck him was breathed forth by a voice and it was caught up and echoed around duck him duck him the pond be close at hand lets give him a taste of his deservings what do he the scum turn himself up at west lynne for bearding mr carlyle what have he done with lady isabel him put up for others at west lynne west lynnes respectable it dont want him it have got a better man it wont have a villain now lads his face turned white and he trembled in his shoesworthless men are frequently cowards lady isabel trembled in hers and well she might hearing that one allusion they set upon him twenty pairs of hands at least strong rough determined hands not to speak of the tagrags help who went in with cuffs and kicks and pokes and taunts and cheers and a demoniac dance they dragged him through a gap in the hedge a gap that no baby could have got through in a cool moment but most of us know the difference between coolness and excitement the hedge was extensively damaged but justice hare to whom it belonged would forgive that mr drake and the lawyerfor the other was a lawyerwere utterly powerless to stop the catastrophe if they didnt mind their own business and keep themselves clear theyd get served the same was the promise held out in reply to their remonstrances and the lawyer who was short and fat and could not have knocked a man down had it been to save his life backed out of the melee and contented himself with issuing forth confused threatenings of the terrors of the law miss carlyle stood her ground majestically and looked on with a grim countenance had she interfered for his protection she could not have been heard and if she could have been theres no knowing whether she would have done it on to the brink of the ponda green dank dark slimy sour stinking pond his coattails were gone by this time and sundry rents and damages appeared inin another useful garment one pulled him another pushed him a third shook him by the collar half a dozen buffeted him and all abused him in with him boys mercy mercy shrieked the victim his knees bending and his teeth chatteringa little mercy for the love of heaven heaven much he knows of heaven a souse a splash a wild cry a gurgle and sir francis levison was floundering in the water its green poison not to mention its adders and thads and frogs going down his throat by bucketfuls a hoarse derisive laugh and a hip hip hurrah broke from the actors while the juvenile ragtag in wild delight joined their hands round the pool and danced the demons dance like so many red indians they had never had such a play acted for them before out of the peasoup before he was quite dead quite senseless of all drowned rats he looked the worst as he stood there with his white rueful face his shivery limbs and his dilapidated garments shaking the wet off him the laborers their duty done walked coolly away the tagrag withdrew to a safe distance waiting for what might come next and miss carlyle moved away also not more shivery was that wretched man than lady isabel as she walked by her side a sorry figure to cut that for her once chosen cavalier what did she think of his beauty now i know what she thought of her past folly miss carlyle never spoke a word she sailed on with her head up though it was turned occasionally to look at the face of madame vine at the deep distressing blush which this gaze called into her cheeks its very odd thought miss corny the likeness especially in the </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> the eyes iswhere are you going madame they were passing a spectacle shop and madame vine had halted at the door one foot on its step i must have my glasses to be mended if you please miss carlyle followed her in she pointed out what she wanted done to the old glasses and said she would buy a pair of new ones to wear while the job was about the man had no blue ones no green plenty of white one ugly old pair of green things he had with tortoiseshell rims left by some stranger ages and ages ago to be mended and never called for again this very pair of ugly old green things was chosen by lady isabel she put them on there and then miss carlyles eyes searching her face inquisitively all the time why do you wear glasses began miss corny abruptly as soon as they were indoors another deep flush and an imperceptible hesitation my eyes are not strong they look as strong as eyes can look but why wear colored glasses white ones would answer every purpose i should suppose i am accustomed to colored ones i should not like white ones now miss corny paused what is your christian name madame began she again jane replied madame popping out an unflinching story in her alarm here here whats up whats this it was a crowd in the street and rather a noisy one miss corny flew to the window lady isabel in her wake two crowds it may almost be said for from the opposite way the scarletandpurple partyas mr carlyles was called in allusion to his colorscame in view quite a collection of gentlemenmr carlyle and lord mount severn heading them what could it mean the mob they were encountering the yellow party doubtless but in a disreputable condition who or what was that object in advance of it supported between drake and the lawyer and looking like a drowned rat hair hanging legs tottering cheeks shaking and clothes in tatters while the mob behind had swollen to the length of the street and was keeping up a perpetual fire of derisive shouts groans and hisses the scarletandpurple halted in consternation and lord mount severn whose sight was not as good as it had been twenty years back stuck his pendent eye glasses astride on the bridge of his nose sir francis levison could it be yes it actually was what on earth had put him into that state mr carlyles lip curled he continued his way and drew the peer with him what the deuce is agate now called out the followers of mr carlyle thats levison has he been in a railway smash and got drenched by the engine he has been ducked grinned the yellows in answer they have been and ducked him in the rush pool on mr justice hares land the soaked and miserable man increased his speed as much as his cold and trembling legs would allow him he would have borne on without legs at all rather than remain under the enemys gaze the enemy loftily continued their way their heads in the air and scorning further notice all save young lord vane he hovered round the ranks of the unwashed and looked vastly inclined to enter upon an indian jig on his own account what a thundering ass i was to try it on at west lynne was the enraged comment of the sufferer miss carlyle laid her hand upon the shrinking arm of her pale companion you see himmy brother archibald i see him faltered lady isabel and you see him that pitiful outcast who is too contemptible to live look at the two and contrast them look well yes was the gaping answer the woman who called him that noble man husband quitted him for the other did she come to repentance think you you may wonder that the submerged gentleman should be walking through the streets on his way to his quarters the raven innfor he had been ejected from the bucks headbut he could not help himself as he was dripping and swearing on the brink of the pond wondering how he should get to the raven an empty fly drove past and mr drake immediately stopped it but when the driver saw that he was expected to convey not only a passenger but a tolerable quantity of water as well and that the passenger moreover was sir francis levison he refused the job his fly was fresh lined with red velvet and he werent a going to have it spoilt he called out as he whipped his horse and drove away leaving the three in wrathful despair sir francis wanted another conveyance procured his friends urged that if he waited for that he might catch his death and that the shortest way would be to hasten to the inn on foot he objected but his jaws were chattering his limbs were quaking so they seized him between them and made off but never bargained for the meeting of mr carlyle and his party francis levison would have stopped in the pond of his own accord head downward rather than faced them miss carlyle went that day to dine at east lynne walking back with mrs carlyle madame vine and lucy lord vane found them out and returned at the same time of course east lynne was the headquarters of himself and his father he was in the seventh heaven and had been ever since the encounter with the yellows youd have gone into laughing convulsions lucy had you seen the drowned cur id give all my tin for six months to come to have a photograph of him as he looked then lucy laughed in glee she was unconscious poor child how deeply the drowned cur had injured her when miss carlyle was in her dressingroom taking her things offthe room where once had slept richard hareshe rang for joyce these two rooms were still kept for miss carlylefor she did sometimes visit them for a few daysand were distinguished by her namemiss carlyles rooms a fine row we have had in the town joyce this afternoon i have heard of it maam served him right if they had let him drown bill white squire pinners plowman called in here and told us the news hed have burst with it if he hadnt i expect i never saw a chap so excited peter cried cried echoed miss carlyle well maam you know he was very fond of lady isabel was peter and somehow his feelings overcame him he said he had not heard anything to please him so much for many a day and with that he burst out crying and gave bill white half a crown out of his pocket bill white said it was he who held one leg when they soused him in afy saw itif youll excuse me mentioning her name to you maam for i know you dont think well of herand when she got in here she fell into hysterics how did she see it snapped miss carlyle her equanimity upset by the sound of the name i didnt see her and i was present she was coming here with a message from mrs latimer to the governess what did she go into hysterics for again snapped miss carlyle it upset her so she said returned joyce it wouldnt have done her harm had they ducked her too was the angry response joyce was silent to contradict miss corny brought triumph to nobody and she was conscious in her innermost heart that afy merited a little wholesome correction not perhaps to the extent of a ducking joyce resumed miss carlyle abruptly changing the subject who does the governess put you in mind of maam repeated joyce in some surprise as it appeared the governess do you mean madame vine do i mean you or do i mean me are we governesses irascibly cried miss corny who should i mean but madame vine she turned herself round from the lookingglass and gazed full in joyces face waiting for the answer joyce lowered her voice as she gave it there are times when she puts me in mind of my late lady both in her face and manner but i have never said so maam for you know lady isabels name must be an interdicted one in this house have you seen her without her glasses no never said joyce i did today returned miss carlyle and i can tell you joyce that i was confounded at the likeness it is an extraordinary likeness one would think it was a ghost of lady isabel vane come into the world again that evening after dinner miss carlyle and lord mount severn sat side by side on the same sofa coffee cups in hand miss carlyle turned to the earl was it a positively ascertained fact that lady isabel died the earl stared with all his might he thought it the strangest question that ever was asked him i scarcely understand you miss carlyle died certainly she died when the result of the accident was communicated to you you made inquiry yourself into its truth its details i believe it was my duty to do so there was no one else to undertake it did you ascertain positively beyond all doubt that she did die of a surety i did she died in the course of the same night terribly injured she was a pause miss carlyle was ruminating but she returned to the charge as if difficult to be convinced you deem that there could be no possibility of an error you are sure that she is dead i am as sure that she is dead as that we are living decisively replied the earl and he spoke but according to his belief wherefore should you be inquiring this a thought came over meonly todayto wonder whether she was really dead had any error occurred at that time any false report of her death i should soon have found it out by her drawing the annuity i settled upon her it has never been drawn since besides she would have written to me as agreed upon no poor thing she is gone beyond all doubt and has taken her sins with her convincing proofs and miss carlyle lent her ear to them the following morning while madame vine was at breakfast mr carlyle entered do you admit intruders here madame vine cried he with his sweet smile and attractive manner she arose her face burning her heart throbbing keep your seat pray i have but a moment to stay said mr carlyle i have come to ask you how william seems there was no difference she murmured and then she took courage and spoke more openly i understood you to say the other night sir that he should have further advice ay i wish him to go over to lynneborough to dr martin the drive i think will do him good replied mr carlyle and i would like you to accompany him if you do not mind the trouble you can have the pony carriage it will be better to go in that than boxed up in the railway carriage you can remind dr martin that the childs constitution is precisely what his mothers was continued mr carlyle a tinge lightening his face it may be a guide to his treatment he said himself it was when he attended him for an illness a year or two ago yes sir he crossed the hall on his entrance to the breakfastroom she tore upstairs to her chamber and sank down in an agony of tears and despair oh to love him as she did now to yearn after his affection with this passionate jealous longing and to know that they were separated for ever and ever that she was worse to him than nothing softly my lady this is not bearing your cross </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxvi appearance of a russian bear at west lynne mr carlyle harangued the populace from the balcony of the bucks head a substantial old house renowned in the days of posting now past and gone its balcony was an oldfashioned roomy balcony painted green where there was </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> was plenty of space for his friends to congregate he was a persuasive orator winning his way to ears and hearts but had he spoken with plums in his mouth and a stammer on his tongue and a breakdown at every sentence the uproarious applause and shouts would be equally rife mr carlyle was intensely popular in west lynne setting aside his candidateship and his oratory and west lynne made common cause against sir francis levison sir francis levison harangued the mob from the raven but in a more ignoble manner for the raven possessed no balcony and he was fain to let himself down with a stride and a jump from the first floor window on the top of the bowwindow of the parlor and stand there the raven though a comfortable old established and respectable inn could boast only of casements for its upper windows and they are not convenient to deliver speeches from he was wont therefore to take his seat on the bowwindow and that was not altogether convenient either for it was but narrow and he hardly dared move an arm or a leg for fear of pitching over on the upturned faces mr drake let himself down also to support him on one side and the first day the lawyer supported him on the other for the first day only for that worthy being not as high as sir francis levisons or mr drakes shoulder and about five times their breadth had those two been rolled into one experienced a slight difficulty in getting back again it was accomplished at last sir francis pulling him up and mr drake hoisting him from behind just as a ladder was being brought out to the rescue amidst shouts of laughter the stout man wiped the perspiration from his face when he was landed in safety and recorded a mental vow never to descend from a window again after that the candidate and his friend shared the shelf between them the lawyers name was rubiny illnaturedly supposed to be a corruption of reuben they stood there one afternoon sir francis eloquence in full play but he was a shocking speaker and the crowd laughing hissing groaning and applauding blocking up the road sir francis could not complain of one thingthat he got no audience for it was the pleasure of west lynne extensively to support him in that respecta few to cheer a great many to jeer and hiss remarkably dense was the mob on this afternoon for mr carlyle had just concluded his address from the bucks head and the crowd who had been listening to him came rushing up to swell the ranks of the other crowd they were elbowing and pushing and treading on each others heels when an open barouche drove suddenly up to scatter them its horses wore scarlet and purple rosettes and one lady a very pretty one sat inside of itmrs carlyle but the crowd could not be so easily scattered it was too thick the carriage could advance but at a snails pace and now and then came to a standstill also till the confusion should be subsided for where was the use of wasting words he did not bow to barbara he remembered the result of his having done so to miss carlyle and the little interlude of the pond had washed most of his impudence out of him he remained at his post not looking at barbara not looking at anything in particular waiting till the interruption should have passed barbara under cover of her dainty lace parasol turned her eyes upon him at that very moment he raised his right hand slightly shook his head back and tossed his hair off his brow his hand ungloved was white and delicate as a ladys and his rich diamond ring gleamed in the sun the pink flush on barbaras cheek deepened to a crimson damask and her brow contracted with a remembrance of pain the very action richard described the action he was always using at east lynne i believe from my heart that the man is thorn that richard was laboring under some mistake when he said he knew sir francis levison she let her hands fall upon her knee as she spoke heedless of the candidate heedless of the crowd heedless of all save her own troubled thoughts a hundred respected salutations were offered her she answered them mechanically a shout was raised long live carlyle carlyle forever barbara bowed her pretty head on either side and the carriage at length got on the parting of the crowd brought mr dill who had come to listen for once to the speech of the second man and mr ebenezer james close to each other mr ebenezer james was one who for the last twelve or fifteen years had been trying his hand at many trades and had not come out particularly well at any a rolling stone gathers no moss first he had been clerk to mr carlyle next he had been seduced into joining the corps of the theatre royal at lynneborough then he turned auctioneer then travelling in the oil and color line then a parson the urgent pastor of some new sect then omnibus driver then collector of the water rate and now he was clerk again not in mr carlyles office but in that of ball treadman other solicitors of west lynne a goodhumored goodnatured freeofmannered idle chap was mr ebenezer james and that was the worst that could be urged against him save that he was sometimes out at pocket and out at elbows his father was a respectable man and had made money in trade but he had married a second wife had a second family and his eldest son did not come in for much of the paternal money though he did for a large share of the paternal anger well ebenezer and how goes the world with you cried mr dill by way of salutation jogging on it never gets to a trot didnt i see you turning into your fathers house yesterday i pretty soon turned out of it again im like the monkey when i venture thereget more kicks than halfpence hush old gentleman we interrupt the eloquence of course the eloquence applied to sir francis levison and they set themselves to listenmr dill with a serious face mr ebenezer with a grinning one but soon a jostle and movement carried them to the outside of the crowd out of sight of the speaker though not entirely out of hearing by these means they had a view of the street and discerned something advancing to them which they took for a russian bear on its hind legs illbeblest uttered mr ebenezer james after a prolonged pause of staring consternation if i dont believe its bethel bethel repeated mr dill gazing at the approaching figure what has he been doing to himself mr otway bethel it was just arrived from foreign parts in his travelling costumesomething shaggy terminating all over with tails a wild object he looked and mr dill rather backed as he drew near as if fearing he was a real animal which might bite him whats your name cried he it used to be bethel replied the wild man holding out his hand to mr dill so you are in the world james and kicking yet and hope to kick in it for some time to come replied mr james where did you hail from last a settlement at the north pole didnt get quite as far whats the row here when did you arrive mr otway inquired old dill now four oclock train i say whats up an election thats all said mr ebenezer attley went and kicked the bucket i dont ask about the election i heard all that at the railway station returned otway bethel impatiently whats this waving his hand at the crowd one of the candidates wasting breath and wordslevison i say repeated otway bethel looking at mr dill wasnt it ratherrather of the ratherest for him to oppose carlyle infamous contemptible was the old gentlemans excited answer but hell get his deserts yet mr otway they have already begun he was treated to a ducking yesterday in justice hares green pond and he did look a miserable devil when he came out trailing through the streets added mr ebenezer while otway bethel burst into a laugh he was smothered into some hot blankets at the raven and a pint of burnt brandy put into him he seems all right today will he go in and win chut win against carlyle he has not the ghost of a chance and governmentif it is the government who put him onmust be a pack of fools they cant know the influence of carlyle bethel is that style of costume the fashion where you come from for slender pockets ill sell em to you now james at half price lets get a look at this levison though i have never seen the fellow another interruption of the crowd even as he spoke caused by the railway van bringing up some luggage they contrived in the confusion to push themselves to the front not far from sir francis otway bethel stared at him in unqualified amazement why what brings him here what is he doing who he pointed his finger the one with the white handkerchief in his hand that is sir francis no uttered bethel a whole world of astounded meaning in his tone by jove he sir francis levison at that moment their eyes met francis levisons and otway bethels otway bethel raised his shaggy hat in salutation and sir francis appeared completely scared only for an instant did he lose his presence of mind the next his eyeglass was stuck in his eye and turned on mr bethel with a hard haughty stare as much as to say who are you fellow that you should take such a liberty but his cheeks and lips were growing as white as marble do you know levison mr otway inquired old dill a little once when he was not levison but somebody else laughed mr ebenezer james eh bethel bethel turned as reproving a stare on mr ebenezer as the baronet had just turned on him what do you mean pray mind your own business a nod to old dill and he turned off and disappeared taking no further notice of james the old gentleman questioned the latter what was that little bit of byplay mr ebenezer nothing much laughed mr ebenezer only he nodding towards sir francis was not always the great man he is now ah i have held my tongue about it for its no affair of mine but i dont mind letting you into the secret would you believe that that grand baronet there wouldbe member for west lynne used years ago to dodge about abbey wood mad after afy hallijohn he didnt call himself levison then mr dill felt as if a hundred pins and needles were pricking at his memory for there rose up in it certain doubts and troubles touching richard hare and one thorn he laid his eager hand upon the others arm ebenezer james what did he call himself thorn a dandy then as he is now he used to come galloping down the swainson road at dusk tie his horse in the woods and monopolize miss afy how do you know this because ive seen it a dozen times i was spooney after afy myself in those days and went down there a good deal in an evening if it hadnt been for him andperhaps that murdering villain dick hare afy would have listened to me not that she cared for dick but you see they were gentlemen i am thankful to the stars now for my luck in escaping her with her for a wife i should have been in a pickle always as it is i do get out of it once in a while did you know then that he was francis levison not i he called himself thorn i tell you when he came down to offer himself for member and oppose carlyle i was thunderstrucklike bethel was a minute ago ho ho said i so </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> so thorns defunct and levison has risen what had otway bethel to do with him nothingthat i know of only bethel was fond of the woods alsoafter other game than afy thoughand may have seen thorn often you saw that he recognized him thornlevison i meandid not appear to like the recognition said mr dill who would in his position laughed ebenezer james i dont like to be reminded of many a wild scrape of my past life in my poor station and what would it be for levison were it to come out that he once called himself thorn and came running after miss afy hallijohn why did he call himself thorn why disguise his own name not knowing cant say is his name levison or is it thorn nonsense mr ebenezer mr dill bursting with the strange news he had heard endeavored to force his way through the crowd that he might communicate it to mr carlyle the crowd was however too dense for him and he had to wait the opportunity of escaping with what patience he might when it came he made his way to the office and entered mr carlyles private room that gentleman was seated at his desk signing letters why dill you are out of breath well i may be mr archibald i have been listening to the most extraordinary statement i have found out about thorn who do you think he is mr carlyle put down his pen and looked full in the old mans face he had never seen him so excited its that man levison i do not understand you said mr carlyle he did not it was as good as hebrew to him the levison of today your opponent is the thorn who went after afy hallijohn it is so mr archibald it cannot be slowly uttered mr carlyle thought upon thought working havoc with his brain where did you hear this mr dill told his tale otway bethels recognition of him sir francis levisons scared paleness for he had noticed that mr ebenezers revelation the point in it all that finally settled most upon mr carlyle was the thought that if levison were indeed the man he could not be instrumental in bringing him to justice bethel has denied to me more than once that he knew thorn or was aware of such a man being in existence observed mr carlyle he must have had a purpose in it then returned mr dill they knew each other today levison recognized him for certain although he carried it off with a high hand pretending not and it was not as levison but as thorn that bethel recognized him theres little doubt of that he did not mention the name thorn but he was evidently struck with astonishment at hearing that it was levison if they have not some secret between them mr archibald ill never believe my own eyes again mrs hares opinion is that bethel had to do with the murder said mr carlyle in a low tone if that is their secret bethel knows the murderer rely upon it was the answer mr archibald it seems to me that now or never is the time to clear up richard aye but how set about it responded mr carlyle meanwhile barbara had proceeded home in her carriage her brain as busy as mr carlyles perhaps more troubled her springing lightly and hastily out the moment it stopped disdaining the footmans arm her compressed lips and absent countenance proved that her resolution was set upon some plan of action william and madame vine met her in the hall we have seen dr martin mrs carlyle and he says i cannot stay to hear now william i will see you later madame she ran upstairs to her dressingroom madame vine following her with her reproachful eyes why should she care thought madame it is not her child throwing her parasol on one chair her gloves on another down sat barbara to her writingtable i will write to him i will have him here if it be but for an hour she passionately exclaimed this shall be so far cleared up i am as sure as sure can be that it is that man the very action richard described and there was the diamond ring for better for worse i will send for him but it will not be for worse if god is with us she dashed off a letter getting up ere she had well begun it to order her carriage round again she would trust none but herself to put it in the post my dear mr smithwe want you here something has arisen that it is necessary to see you upon you can get here by saturday be in these grounds near the covered walk that evening at dusk ever yours b and the letter was addressed to mr smith of some street in liverpool the address furnished by richard very cautions to see was barbara she even put mr smith inside the letter now stop cried barbara to herself as she was folding it i ought to send him a five pound note for he may not have the means to come and i dont think i have one of that amount in the house she looked in her secretaire not a single fivepound note out of the room she ran meeting joyce who was coming along the corridor do you happen to have a fivepound note joyce no maam not by me i dare say madame vine has i paid her last week and there were two fivepound notes amongst it and away went barbara to the gray parlor could you lend me a fivepound note madame vine i have occasion to enclose one in a letter and find i do not possess one madame vine went to her room to get it barbara waited she asked william what dr martin said he tried my chest withoh i forget what they call itand he said i must be a brave boy and take my codliver oil well and port wine and everything i liked that was good and he said he should be at west lynne next wednesday afternoon and i am to go there and he would call in and see me where are you to meet him he said either at papas office or at aunt cornelias as we might decide madame fixed it for papas office for she thought he might like to see dr martin i say mamma what asked barbara madame vine has been crying ever since why should she im sure i dont know crying yes but she wipes her eyes under her spectacles and thinks i dont see her i know i am very ill but why should she cry for that nonsense william who told you you were very ill nobody i suppose i am he thoughtfully added if joyce or lucy cried now thered be some sense in it for they have known me all my life you are so apt to fancy things you are always doing it it is not likely that madame would be crying because you are ill madame came in with the banknote barbara thanked her ran upstairs and in another minute or two was in her carriage she was back again and dressing when the gentlemen returned to dinner mr carlyle came upstairs barbara like most persons who do things without reflection having had time to cool down from her ardor was doubting whether she had acted wisely in sending so precipitately for richard she carried her doubt and care to her husband her sure refuge in perplexity archibald i fear i have done a foolish thing he laughed i fear we all do that at times barbara what is it he had seated himself in one of barbaras favorite low chairs and she stood before him leaning on his shoulder her face a little behind so that he could not see it in her delicacy she would not look at him while she spoke what she was going to speak it is something that i have had upon my mind for years and i did not like to tell it to you for years you remember that night years ago when richard was at the grove in disguise which night barbara he came more than once the nightthe night that lady isabel quitted east lynne she answered not knowing how better to bring it to his recollection and she stole her hand lovingly into his as she said it richard came back after his departure saying he had met thorn in bean lane he described the peculiar motion of the hand as he threw back his hair from his brow he spoke of the white hand and the diamond ringhow it glittered in the moonlight do you remember i do the motion appeared perfectly familiar to me for i had seen it repeatedly used by one then staying at east lynne i wondered you did not recognize it from that night i had little doubt as to the identity of thorn i believed that he and captain levison were one a pause why did you not tell me so barbara how could i speak of that man to you at that time afterwards when richard was here that snowy winters day he asserted that he knew sir frances levison that he had seen him and thorn together and that put me off the scent but today as i was passing the raven in the carriagegoing very slow on account of the crowdhe was perched out there addressing the people and i saw the very same actionthe old action that i had used to see barbara paused mr carlyle did not interrupt her i feel a conviction that they are the samethat richard must have been under some unaccountable mistake in saying that he knew francis levison besides who but he in evening dress would have been likely to go through bean lane that night it leads to no houses but one wishing to avoid the high road could get into it from these grounds and so on to west lynne he must have gone back directly on foot to west lynne to get the post carriage as was proved and he would naturally go through bean lane forgive me archibald for recalling these things to you but i feel so sure that levison and thorn are one i know they are he quietly said barbara in her astonishment drew back and stared him in the facea face of severe dignity it was just then oh archibald did you know it at that time i did not know it until this afternoon i never suspected it i wonder you did not i have wondered often so do i now dill ebenezer james and otway bethelwho came home todaywere standing before the raven listening to his speech when bethel recognized him not as levisonhe was infinitely astonished to find he was levison levison they say was scared at the recognition and changed color bethel would give no explanation and moved away but james told dill that levison was the man thorn who used to be after afy hallijohn how did you know breathlessly asked barbara because mr ebenezer was after afy himself and repeatedly saw thorn in the wood barbara i believe now that it was levison who killed hallijohn but i should like to know what bethel had to do with it barbara clasped her hands how strange it is she exclaimed in some excitement mamma told me yesterday that she was convinced something or other was going to turn up relative to the murder she had had the most distressing dream she said connected with richard and bethel and somebody else whom she appeared to know in the dream but could not recognize or remember when she was awake she was as ill as could beshe does put such faith in these wretched dreams one would think you did also barbara by your vehemence no no you know better but it is strangeyou must acknowledge that it isthat so sure as anything fresh happens touching the subject of the murder so sure is a troubled dream the forerunner of it mamma does not have them </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> them at other times bethel denied to you that he knew thorn i know he did and now it turns out that he does know him and he is always in mammas dreamsnone more prominent in them than bethel but archibald i am not telling youi have sent for richard you have i felt sure that levison was thorn i did not expect that others would recognize him and i acted on the impulse of the moment and wrote to richard telling him to be here on saturday evening the letter is gone well we must shelter him as best we can archibalddear archibald what can be done to clear him she asked the tears rising to her eyes being levison i cannot act what she uttered not actnot act for richard he bent his clear truthful eyes upon her my dearest how can i she looked a little rebellious and the tears fell you have not considered barbara any one in the world but levison it would look like my own revenge forgive me she softly whispered you are always right i did not think of it in that light but what steps do you imagine can be taken it is a case encompassed with difficulties mused mr carlyle let us wait until richard comes do you happen to have a fivepound note in your pocket archibald i had not one to send to him and borrowed it from madame vine he took out his pocket book and gave it to her in the gray parlor in the dark twilight of the april eveningor it was getting far into the nightwere william carlyle and lady isabel it had been a warm day but the spring evenings were still chilly and a fire burned in the grate there was no blaze the red embers were smoldering and half dead but madame vine did not bestir herself to heed the fire william lay on the sofa and she sat by looking at him her glasses were off for the tears wetted them continually and it was not the recognition of the children she feared he was tired with the drive to lynneborough and back and lay with eyes shut she thought asleep presently he opened them how long will it be before i die the words took her utterly by surprise and her heart went round in a whirl what do you mean william who said anything about dying oh i know i know by the fuss there is over me you heard what hannah said the other night what when when she brought in the tea and i was lying on the rug i was not asleep though you thought i was you told her she ought to be more cautious for that i might not have been asleep i dont remember much about it said lady isabel at her wits ends how to remove the impression hannahs words must have created had he indeed heard them hannah talks great nonsense sometimes she said i was going on fast to the grave did she nobody attends to hannah she is only a foolish girl we shall soon have you well when the warm weather comes madame vine well my darling wheres the use of your trying to deceive me do you think i dont see that you are doing it im not a baby you might if it were archibald what is it thats the matter with me nothing only you are not strong when you get strong again you will be as well as ever william shook his head in disbelief he was precisely that sort of child from whom it is next to impossible to disguise facts quick thoughtful observant and advanced beyond his years had no words been dropped in his hearing he would have suspected the evil by the care evinced for him but plenty of words had been dropped hints by which he had gathered suspicion broad assertions like hannahs which had too fully supplied it and the boy in his inmost heart knew as well that death was coming for him as that death itself did then if theres nothing the matter with me why could not dr martin speak to you before me today why did he send me into the other room while he told you what he thought ah madame vine i am as wise as you a wise little boy but mistaken sometimes she said from her aching heart its nothing to die when god loves us lord vane says so he had a little brother who died a sickly child who was never likely to live he had been pale and ailing from a baby spoke lady isabel why did you know him ii heard so she replied turning off her thoughtless avowal in the best manner she could dont you know that i am going to die no then why have you been grieving since we left dr martins and why do you grieve at all for me i am not your child the words the scene altogether overcame her she knelt down by the sofa and her tears burst forth freely there you see cried william oh william ii had a little boy of my own and when i look at you i think of him and that is why i cry i know you have told us of him before his name was william too she leaned over him her breath mingling with his she took his little hand in hers william do you know that those whom god loves best he takes first were you to die you would go to heaven leaving all the cares and sorrows of the world behind you it would have been happier for many of us had we died in infancy would it have been happier for you yes she faintly said i have had more than my share of sorrow sometimes i think that i cannot support it is it not past then do you have sorrow now i have it always i shall have it till i die had i died a child william i should have escaped it oh the world is full of it full and full what sort of sorrow all sorts pain sickness care trouble sin remorse weariness she wailed out i cannot enumerate the half that the world brings upon us when you are very very tired william does it not seem a luxury a sweet happiness to lie down at night in your little bed waiting for the bliss of sleep yes and i am often tired so tired as that then just so do we who are tired of the worlds cares long for the grave in which we shall lie down to rest we covet it william long for it but you cannot understand that we dont lie in the grave madame vine no no child our bodies lie there to be raised again in beauty at the last day we go into a blessed place of rest where sorrow and pain cannot come i wishi wish she uttered with a bursting heart that you and i were both there who says the worlds so sorrowful madame vine i think it is lovely especially when the suns shining on a hot day and the butterflies come out you should see east lynne on a summers morning when you are running up and down the slopes and the trees are waving overhead and the skys blue and the roses and flowers are all out you would not call it a sad world a pleasant world one might regret to leave if we were not wearied by pain and care but what is this world take it at its best in comparison with that other world heaven i have heard of some people who are afraid of death they fear they shall not go to it but when god takes a little child there it is because he loves him it is a land as mrs barbauld says where the roses are without thorns where the flowers are not mixed with brambles i have seen the flowers interrupted william rising in his earnestness they are ten times brighter than our flowers here seen the flowers the flowers we shall see in heaven she echoed i have seen a picture of them we went to lynneborough to see martins picture of the last judgmenti dont mean dr martin said william interrupting himself i know there were three pictures one was called the plains of heaven and i liked that best and so we all did oh you should have seen it did you ever see them madame vine no i have heard of them there was a river you know and boats beautiful gondolas they looked taking the redeemed to the shores of heaven they were shadowy figures in white robes myriads of them for they reached all up in the air to the holy city it seemed to be in the clouds coming down from god the flowers grew on the banks of the river pink and blue and violet all colors they were but so bright and beautiful brighter than our flowers are who took you to see the pictures papa he took me and lucy and mrs hare went with us and barbarashe was not our mamma then but madamedropping his voicewhat stupid thing do you think lucy asked papa what did she ask him she asked whether mamma was amongst that crowd in the white robes whether she was gone up to heaven our mamma that was you know and lots of people could hear what she said lady isabel dropped her face upon her hands what did your papa answer she breathed i dont know nothing i think he was talking to barbara but it was very stupid of lucy because wilson has told her over and over again that she must never talk of lady isabel to papa miss manning told her so too when we got home and wilson heard of it she said lucy deserved a good shaking why must not lady isabel be talked of to him a moment after the question had left her lips she wondered what possessed her to give utterance to it ill tell you said william in a whisper she ran away from papa lucy talks nonsense about her having been kidnapped but she knows nothing i do though they dont think it perhaps she may be among the redeemed some time william and you with her he fell back on the sofapillow with a weary sigh and lay in silence lady isabel shaded her face and remained in silence also soon she was aroused from it william was in a fit of loud sobbing tears oh i dont want to die i dont want to die why should i go and leave papa and lucy she hung over him she clasped her arms around him her tears her sobs mingling with his she whispered to him sweet and soothing words she placed him so that he might sob out his grief upon her bosom and in a little while the paroxysm had passed hark exclaimed william whats that a sound of talking and laughter in the hall mr carlyle lord mount severn and his son were leaving the diningroom they had some committee appointed that evening at west lynne and were departing to keep it as the halldoor closed upon them barbara came into the gray parlor up rose madame vine scuffled on her spectacles and took her seat soberly upon a chair all in the dark and your fire going out exclaimed barbara as she hastened to stir the latter and send it into a blaze whos on the sofa william you ought to be to bed not yet mamma i dont want to go yet but it is quite time that you should she returned ringing the bell to sit up at night is not the way to make you strong william was dismissed and then she returned to madame vine and inquired what dr martin had said he said the lungs were undoubtedly affected but like all doctors he would give no decisive opinion i could see that he had formed one mrs carlyle looked at her the firelight played </highSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> played especially upon the spectacles and she moved her chair into the shade dr martin will see him again next week he is coming to west lynne i am sure by the tone of his voice by his evasive manner that he anticipates the worst although he would not say so in words i will take william into west lynne myself observed barbara the doctor will of course tell me i came in to pay my debts she added dismissing the subject of the child and holding out a fivepound note lady isabel mechanically stretched out her hand for it whilst we are as may be said upon the money topic resumed barbara in a gay tone will you allow me to intimate that both myself and mr carlyle very much disapprove of your making presents to the children i was calculating at a rough guess the cost of the toys and things you have bought for them and i think it must amount to a very large portion of the salary you have received pray do not continue this madame vine i have no one else to spend my money on i love the children was madames answer somewhat sharply given as if she were jealous of the interference between her and the children and would resent it nay you have yourself and if you do not require much outlay you have i should suppose a reserve fund to which to put your money be so kind as to take the hint madame otherwise i shall be compelled more peremptorily to forbid your generosity it is very good of you very kind but if you do not think yourself we must for you i will buy them less was the murmured answer i must give them a little token of love now and then that you are welcome to doa little token once in a way but not the costly toys you have been purchasing have you ever had an acquaintance with sir francis levison continued mrs carlyle passing with abruptness from one point to another an inward shiver a burning cheek a heartpang of wild remorse and a faint answer no i fancied from your manner when i was speaking of him the other day that you knew him or had known him no compliment you will say to assume an acquaintance with such a man he is a stranger to you then another faint reply yes barbara paused do you believe in fatality madame vine yes i do was the steady answer i dont and yet the very question proved that she did not wholly disbelieve it no i dont added barbara stoutly as she approached the sofa vacated by william and sat down upon it thus bringing herself opposite and near to madame vine are you aware that it was francis levison who brought the evil to this house the evil stammered madame vine yes it was he she resumed taking the hesitating answer for an admission that the governess knew nothing or but little of past events it was he who took lady isabel from her homethough perhaps she was as willing to go as he was to take her i do know oh no no broke from the unguarded lips of madame vine at leasti meani should think not she added in confusion we shall never know and of what consequence is it one thing is certain she went another thing almost equally certain is she did not go against her will did you ever hear the details no her answer would have been yes but possibly the next question might have been from whom did you hear them he was staying at east lynne the man had been abroad outlawed dared not show his face in england and mr carlyle in his generosity invited him to east lynne as a place of shelter where he would be safe from his creditors while something was arranged he was a connection in some way of lady isabels and they repaid mr carlyle he and she by quitting east lynne together why did mr carlyle give that invitation the words were uttered in a spirit of remorseful wailing mrs carlyle believed they were a question put and she rose up haughtily against it why did he give the invitation did i hear you aright madame vine did mr carlyle know he was a reprobate and if he had known it was not isabel his wife could he dream of danger for her if it pleased mr carlyle to fill east lynne with bad men tomorrow what would that be to meto my safety to my wellbeing to my love and allegiance to my husband what were you thinking of madame thinking of she leaned her troubled head upon her hand mrs carlyle resumed sitting alone in the drawingroom just now and thinking matters over it did seem to me very like what people call a fatality that man i say was the one who wrought the disgrace the trouble to mr carlyles family and it is he i have every reason now to believe who brought a nearly equal disgrace and trouble upon mine did you know mrs carlyle lowered her voicethat i have a brother in evilin shame lady isabel did not dare to answer that she did know it who had there been likely to inform her the strange governess of the tale of richard hare so the world calls itshame pursued barbara growing excited and it is shame but not as the world thinks it the shame lies with another who had thrust the suffering and shame upon richard and that other is francis levison i will tell you the tale it is worth the telling she could only dispose herself to listen but she wondered what francis levison had to do with richard hare in the days long gone by when i was little more than a child richard took to going after afy hallijohn you have seen the cottage in the wood she lived there with her father and joyce it was very foolish for him but young men will be foolish as many more went after her or wanted to go after her as she could count upon her ten fingers among them chief of them more favored even than richard was one called thorn by social position a gentleman he was a stranger and used to ride over in secret the night of the murder camethe dreadful murder when hallijohn was shot down dead richard ran away testimony was strong against him and the coroners jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder against richard hare the younger we never supposed but what he was guiltyof the act mind you not of the intention even mamma who so loved him believed he had done it but she believed it was the result of accident not design oh the trouble that has been the lot of my poor mamma cried barbara clasping her hands and she had no one to sympathize with herno one no one i as i tell you was little more than a child and papa who might have done it took part against richard it went on for three or four years the sorrow and there was no mitigation at the end of that period richard came for a few hours to west lynnecame in secretand we learnt for the first time that he was not guilty the man who did the deed was thorn richard was not even present the next question was how to find thorn nobody knew anything about himwho he was what he was where he came from where he went to and thus more years passed on another thorn came to west lynnean officer in her majestys service and his appearance tallied with the description richard had given i assumed it to be the one mr carlyle assumed it but before anything could be done or even thought of captain thorn was gone again barbara paused to take breath madame vine sat listless enough what was this tale to her again years went on the period came of francis levisons sojourn at east lynne whilst i was there captain thorn arrived once more on a visit to the herberts we then strove to find out points of his antecedents mr carlyle and i and we became nearly convinced that he was the man i had to come here often to see mr carlyle for mamma did not dare to stir in the affair papa was so violent against richard thus i often saw francis levison but he was visible to scarcely any other visitor being at east lynne en cachette he intimated that he was afraid of encountering creditors i now begin to doubt whether that was not a false plea and i remember mr carlyle said at the time that he had no creditors in or near west lynne then what was his motive for shunning societyfor never going out interrupted lady isabel too well she remembered that bygone time francis levison had told that the fear of his creditors kept him up so closely though he had once said to her they were not in the immediate neighborhood of east lynne he had a worse fear upon him than that of creditors returned mrs carlyle singular to say during this visit of captain thorn to the herberts we received an intimation from my brother that he was once more about to venture for a few hours to west lynne i brought the news to mr carlyle i had to see him and consult with him more frequently than ever mamma was painfully restless and anxious and mr carlyle as eager as we were for the establishment of richards innocence for miss carlyle and papa are related consequently the disgrace may be said to reflect on the carlyle name back went lady isabels memory and her bitter repentance she remembered how jealously she had attributed these meetings between mr carlyle and barbara to another source oh why had she suffered her mind to be so falsely and fatally perverted richard came it was hastily arranged that he should go privately to mr carlyles office after the clerks had left for the night be concealed there and have an opportunity given him of seeing captain thorn there was no difficulty for mr carlyle was transacting some matter of business for the captain and appointed him to be at the office at eight oclock a memorable night that to mr carlyle for it was the one of his wifes elopement lady isabel looked up with a start it was indeed shelady isabeland mr carlyle were engaged to a dinner party and mr carlyle had to give it up otherwise he could not have served richard he is always considerate and kind thinking of others welfarenever of his own gratification oh it was an anxious night papa was out i waited at home with mamma doing what i could to sooth her restless suspense for there was hazard to richard in his night walk through west lynne to keep the appointment and when it was over he was to come home for a short interview with mamma who had not seen him for several years barbara stopped lost in thought not a word spoke madame vine she still wondered what this affair touching richard hare and thorn could have to do with francis levison i watched from the window and saw them come in at the garden gatemr carlyle and richardbetween nine and ten oclock i think it must have been then the first words they said to me were that it was not the captain thorn spoken of by richard i felt a shock of disappointment which was wicked enough of me but i had been so sure he was the man and to hear that he was not seemed to throw us further back than ever mr carlyle on the contrary was glad for he had taken a liking to captain thorn well richard went in to mamma and mr carlyle was so kind as to accede to her request that he would remain and pace the garden with me we were so afraid of papas coming home he was bitter against richard and would inevitably have </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> have delivered him up at once to justice had he come in mr carlyle was to keep him in the garden by the gate whilst i ran in to give notice and conceal richard in the hall richard lingered papa did not come and i cannot tell how long we paced there but i had my shawl on and it was a lovely moonlight night that unhappy listener clasped her hands to pain the matteroffact tone the unconscious mention of commonplace trifles proved that they had not been pacing about in disloyalty to her or for their own gratification why had she not trusted her noble husband why had she listened to that false man as he pointed them out to her walking there in the moonlight why had she given vent in the chariot to that burst of passionate tears of angry reproach why oh why had she hastened to be revenged but for seeing them together she might not have done as she did richard came forth at last and departed to be again an exile mr carlyle also departed and i remained at the gate watching for papa by and by mr carlyle came back again he had got nearly home when he remembered that he had left a parchment at our house it seemed to be nothing but coming back for just after he had gone a second time richard returned in a state of excitement stating that he had seen thornthorn the murderer i meanin bean lane for a moment i doubted him but not for long and we ran after mr carlyle richard described thorns appearance his evening dress his white hands and diamond ring more particularly he described a peculiar motion of his hand as he threw back his hair in that moment it flashed across me that thorn must be captain levison the description was exact many and many a time since have i wondered that the thought did not strike mr carlyle lady isabel sat with her mouth open as if she could not take in the sense of the words and when it did become clear to her she utterly rejected it francis levison a murderer oh no bad man as he is he is not that wait said mrs carlyle i did not speak of this doubtnay this convictionwhich had come how could i mention to mr carlyle the name of the man who did him that foul wrong and richard has remained so long in exile with the ban of guilt upon him today as my carriage passed through west lynne francis levison was haranguing the people i saw that very same actionthe throwing back of the hair with his white hand i saw the selfsame diamond ring and my conviction that he was the same man became more firmly seated than ever it is impossible murmured lady isabel wait i say said barbara when mr carlyle came home to dinner i for the first time mentioned this to him it was no newsthe fact was not this afternoon during that same harangue francis levison was recognized by two witnesses to be the man thornthe man who went after afy hallijohn it is horrible lady isabel sat and looked at mrs carlyle not yet did she believe it yes it does appear to me as being perfectly horrible continued mrs carlyle he murdered hallijohnhe that bad man and my poor brother has suffered the odium when richard met him that night in bean lane he was sneaking to west lynne in search of the chaise that afterward bore away him and his companion papa saw them drive away papa stayed out late and in returning home a chaise and four tore past just as he was turning in at the gate if that miserable lady isabel had but known with whom she was flying a murderer in addition to his other achievements it is a mercy for her that she is no longer alive what would her feelings be what were they then as she sat there a murderer and she hadin spite of her caution of her strife for selfcommand she turned of a deadly whiteness and a low sharp cry of horror and despair burst from her lips mrs carlyle was astonished why should her communication have produced this effect upon madame vine a renewed suspicion that she knew more of francis levison than she would acknowledge stole over her madame vine what is he to you she asked bending forward madame vine doing fierce battle with herself recovered her outward equanimity i beg your pardon mrs carlyle she said shivering i am apt to picture things too vividly it is as you say so very horrible is he nothing to you dont you know him he is nothing to meless than nothing as to knowing himi saw him yesterday when they put him into the pond a man like that i should shudder to meet him ay indeed said barbara reassured you will understand madame vine that this history has been given to you in confidence i look upon you as one of ourselves there was no answer madame vine sat on with her white face she and it wore altogether a ghastly look it tells like a fable out of a romance resumed mrs carlyle well for him if the romance be not ended in the gibbet fancy what it would be for himsir francis levisonto be hung for murder barbara my dearest the voice was mr carlyles and she flew off on the wings of love it appeared that the gentlemen had not yet departed and now thought they would take coffee first she flew off to her idolized husband leaving her who had once been idolized to her loneliness she sank down on the sofa she threw her arms up in her heartsickness she thought she would faint she prayed to die it was horrible as barbara had called it for that man with the red stain upon his hand and soul she had flung away archibald carlyle if ever retribution came home to woman it came home in that hour to lady isabel </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxvii mr carlyle invited to some pate de foie gras a sighing morning wind swept round the domains of east lynne bending the tall poplar trees in the distance swaying the oak and elms nearer rustling the fine old chestnuts in the park a melancholy sweeping fitful wind the weather had changed from brightness and warmth and heavy gathering clouds seemed to be threatening rain so at least deemed one wayfarer who was journeying on a solitary road that saturday night he was on foot a man attired in the garb of a sailor with black curling ringlets of hair and black curling whiskers a prodigious pair of whiskers hiding his neck above his blue turned collar hiding partially his face the glazed hat brought low upon his brows concealed it still more and he wore a loose rough peajacket and wide rough trousers hitched up with a belt bearing steadily on he struck into bean lane a byway already mentioned in this history and from thence passing through a small unfrequented gate he found himself in the grounds of east lynne let me see mused he as he closed the gate behind him and slipped the bolt the covered walk that must be near the acacia trees then i must wind round to the right i wonder if either of them will be there waiting for me yes pacing the covered walk in her bonnet and mantle as if taking an evening strollhad any one encountered her which was very unlikely seeing that it was the most retired spot in the groundswas mrs carlyle oh richard my poor brother locked in a yearning embrace emotion overpowered both barbara sobbed like a child a little while and then he put her from him to look at her so barbara you are a wife now oh the happiest wife richard sometimes i ask myself what i have done that god should have showered down blessings so great upon me but for the sad trouble when i think of you my life would be as one long summers day i have the sweetest babynearly a year old he is now i shall have another soon god willing and archibaldoh i am so happy she broke suddenly off with the name archibald not even to richard could she speak of her intense love for and happiness in her husband how is it at the grove he asked quite well quite as usual mamma has been in better health lately she does not know of this visit but i must see her interrupted richard i did not see her the last time you remember all in good time to talk of that how are you getting on in liverpool what are you doing dont inquire too closely barbara i have no regular work but i get a job at the docks now and then and rub on it is seasonable help that which comes to me occasionally from you is it from you or carlyle barbara laughed how are we to distinguish his money is mine now and mine is his we dont have separate purses richard we send it to you jointly sometimes i have fancied it came from my mother barbara shook her head we have never allowed mamma to know that you left london or that we hold an address where we can write to you it would not have done why have you summoned me here barbara what has turned up thorn hasi think you would know him again richard know him passionately echoed richard hare were you aware that a contest for the membership is going on at west lynne i saw it in the newspapers carlyle against sir francis levison i say barbara how could he think of coming here to oppose carlyle after his doing with lady isabel i dont know said barbara i wonder that he should come here for other reasons also first of all richard tell me how you came to know sir francis levison you say you did know him and that you had seen him with thorn so i do know him answered richard and i saw him with thorn twice know him by sight only i presume let me hear how you came to know him he was pointed out to me i saw him walk arminarm with a gentleman and i showed them to the waterman at the cabstand hard by do you know that fellow i asked him indicating thorn for i wanted to come at who he really iswhich i didnt do i dont know that one the old chap answered but the one with him is levison the baronet they are often togethera couple of swells they looked and thats how you got to know levison that was it said richard hare then richard you and the waterman made a mess of it between you he pointed out the wrong one or you did not look at the right thorn is sir francis levison richard stared at her with all his eyes nonsense barbara he is i have never doubted it since the night you saw him in bean lane the action you described of his pushing back his hair his white hands his sparkling diamond ring could only apply in my mind to one personfrancis levison on thursday i drove by the raven when he was speechifying to the people and i noticed the selfsame action in the impulse of the moment i wrote off for you that you might come and set the doubt at rest i need not have done it it seems for when mr carlyle returned home that evening and i acquainted him with what i had done he told me that thorn and francis levison are one and the same otway bethel recognized him that same afternoon and so did ebenezer james theyd both know him eagerly cried richard james i am positive would for he was skulking down to hallijohns often then and saw thorn a dozen times otway bethel must have seen him also though he protested he had not barbara the name was uttered in affright and richard plunged amidst the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> the trees for somebody was in sighta tall dark form advancing from the end of the walk barbara smiled it was only mr carlyle and richard emerged again fears still richard mr carlyle exclaimed as he shook richard cordially by the hand so you have changed your travelling toggery i couldnt venture here again in the old suit it had been seen you said returned richard i bought this rigout yesterday secondhand two pounds for the loti think they shaved me ringlets and all laughed mr carlyle its the old hair oiled and curled cried dick the barber charged a shilling for doing it and cut my hair into the bargain i told him not to spare grease for i liked the curls to shinesailors always do mr carlyle barbara says that levison and that brute thornthe ones as much of a brute as the other thoughhave turned out to be the same they have richard as it appears nevertheless it may be as well for you to take a private view of levison before anything is doneas you once did by the other thorn it would not do to make a stir and then discover that there was a mistakethat he was not thorn when can i see him asked richard eagerly it must be contrived somehow were you to hang about the doors of the raventhis evening evenyoud be sure to get the opportunity for he is always passing in and out no one will know you or think of you either their heads are turned with the election i shall look odd to peoples eyes you dont get many sailors in west lynne not odd at all we have a russian bear here at present and youll be nobody beside him a russian bear repeated richard while barbara laughed mr otway bethel has returned in what is popularly supposed to be a bears hide hence the new name he is greeted with will it turn out richard that he had anything to do with the murder richard shook his head he couldnt have mr carlyle i have said so all along but about levison if i find him to be the man thorn what steps can then be taken thats the difficulty said mr carlyle who will set it agoing who will move in it you must richard i uttered richard hare in consternation i move in it you yourself who else is there i have been thinking it well over and can hit upon no one why wont you take it upon yourself mr carlyle no being levison was the answer curse him impetuously retorted richard curse him doubly if he be the double villain but why should you scruple mr carlyle most men wronged as you have been would leap at the opportunity for revenge for the crime perpetrated upon hallijohn i would pursue him to the scaffold for my own wrong no but the remaining negative has cost me something many a time since this appearance of his at west lynne have i been obliged to lay violent control upon myself or i should have horsewhipped him within an ace of his life if you horsewhipped him to death he would only meet his deserts i leave him to a higher retributionto one who says vengeance is mine i believe him to be guilty of the murder but if the uplifting of my finger would send him to his disgraceful death i would tie down my hand rather than lift it for i could not in my own mind separate the man from the injury though i might ostensibly pursue him as the destroyer of hallijohn to me he would appear ever as the destroyer of another and the world always charitable would congratulate mr carlyle upon gratifying his revenge i stir in it not richard couldnt barbara pleaded richard barbara was standing with her arm entwined within her husbands and mr carlyle looked down as he answered barbara is my wife it was a sufficient answer then the things again at an end said richard gloomily and i must give up hope of ever being cleared by no means said mr carlyle the one who ought to act in this is your father richard but we know he will not your mother cannot she has neither health nor energy for it and if she had a full supply of both she would not dare to brave her husband and use them in the cause my hands are tied barbaras equally so as part of me there only remains yourself and what can i do wailed poor dick if your hands are tied im sure my whole body is speaking in comparison hands and legs and neck its in jeopardy that is every hour your acting in this affair need not put it any the more in jeopardy you must stay in the neighborhood for a few days i dare not interposed richard in a fright stay in the neighborhood for a few days no that i never may listen richard you must put away these timorous fears or else you must make up your mind to remain under the ban for good and remember your mothers happiness is at stake equally with yoursi could almost say her life do you suppose i would advise you for danger you used to say there was some place a mile or two from this where you could sojourn in safety so there is but i always feel safer when i get away from it there your quarters must be for two or three days at any rate i have turned matters over in my own mind and will tell you what i think should be done so far as the preliminary step goes though i do not interfere myself only the preliminary step there must be a pretty many to follow it sir if its to come to anything well what is it apply to ball treadman and get them to take it they were now slowly pacing the covered walk barbara on her husbands arm richard by the side of mr carlyle dick stopped when he heard the last words i dont understand you mr carlyle you might as well advise me to go before the bench of magistrates at once ball treadman would walk me off there as soon as i showed myself nothing of the sort richard i do not tell you to go openly to their office as another client would what i would advise is thismake a friend of mr ball he can be a good man and true if he chooses tell the whole story to him in a private place and interview and ask him whether he will carry it through if he is fully impressed with the conviction that you are innocent as the facts appear to warrant he will undertake it treadman need know nothing of the affair at first and when ball puts things in motion he need not know that you are here or where you are to be found i dont dislike ball mused richard and if he would only give his word to be true i know he would be the difficulty will be who is to get the promise from him i will said mr carlyle i will so far pave the way for you that done my interference is over how will he go about it think you if he does take it up that is his affair i know how i should how sir you cannot expect me to say richard i might as well act for you i know youd go at it slapdash and arrest levison offhand on the charge a smile parted mr carlyles lips for dick had just guessed it but his countenance gave no clue by which anything could be gathered a thought flashed across richards mind a thought which rose up on end even his false hair mr carlyle he uttered in an accent of horror if ball should take it up in that way against levison he must apply to the bench for a warrant well quietly returned mr carlyle and theyd send and clap me into prison you know the warrant is always out against me youd never make a conjurer richard i dont pretend to say or guess at what balls proceedings may be but in applying to the bench for a warrant against levisonshould that form part of themis there any necessity for him to bring you into say gentlemen richard hare is within reach ready to be taken your fears run away with your common sense richard ah well if you had lived with the cord around your neck this many a year not knowing any one hour but it might get tied the next youd lose your common sense too at times humbly sighed poor richard whats to be my first move sir your first move richard must be to go to this place of concealment which you know of and remain quiet there until monday on monday at dusk be here again meanwhile i will see ball by the way though before speaking to ball i must hear from yourself that thorn and levison are one i will go down to the raven at once eagerly cried richard ill come back here to this walk as soon as i have obtained sight of him with the last words he turned and was speeding off when barbara caught him you will be so tired richard tired echoed richard hare a hundred miles on foot would not tire me if thorn was at the end of them waiting to be identified i may not be back for two or three hours but i will come and wait here till you come out to me you must be hungry and thirsty returned barbara the tears in her eyes how i wish we dare have you in and shelter you but i can manage to bring some refreshments out here i dont require it barbara i left the train at the station next before west lynne and dropped into a roadside public house as i walked and got a good supper let me go dear i am all in a fever richard departed reached the part of west lynne where the raven was situated and was so far favored by fortune that he had not long to wait scarcely had he taken up his lounge outside when two gentlemen came forth from it arminarm being the headquarters of one of the candidates the idlers of the place thought they could not do better than make it their headquarters also and the road and pavement were never free from loitering starers and gossipers richard hare his hat well over his eyes and his black ringlets made the most of only added one to the rest two gentlemen came forth arminarm the loiterers raised a feeble shout of levison forever richard did not join in the shout but his pulses were beating and his heart leaped up within him the one was thorn the other the gentleman he had seen with thorn in london pointed out to himas he had believedas sir francis levison which of those two is levison he inquired of a man near whom he stood dont you know him him with the hat off bowing his thanks to us is levison no need to inquire further it was the thorn of richards memory his ungloved hand raised to his hat was as white as ever more sparkling than ever as it flashed in the street gaslight was the diamond ring by the hand and ring alone richard would have sworn to the man had it been needful who is the other one he continued some gent as came down from london with him his names drake be you yellow sailor or be you scarletandpurple i am neither i am only a stranger passing through the town on the tramp tramp no and richard moved away to make the best of his progress to east lynne and report to mr carlyle now it happened on that windy night that lady isabel her mind disordered her brow fevered with its weight of care stole out into the grounds after the children had left her for the night </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> night courting any discomfort she might meet as if they could even for a moment cool the fire within to the solitude of this very covered walk bent she her steps and not long had she paced it when she descried some man advancing in the garb of a sailor not caring to be seen she turned short off amidst the trees intending to emerge again when he had passed she wondered who he was and what brought him there but he did not pass he lingered in the walk keeping her a prisoner a minute more and she saw him joined by mrs carlyle they met with a loving embrace embrace a strange man mrs carlyle all the blood in lady isabels body rushed to her brain was she his second wife false to himmore shamelessly false than even herself had been inasmuch as she had had the grace to quit him and east lynne beforeas the servant girls say when they change their sweetheartstaking up with another the positive conviction that such was the case seized firm hold upon her fancy her thoughts were in a tumult her mind was a chaos was there any small corner of rejoicing in her heart that it was so and yet what was it to her it could not alter by one iota her own positionit could not restore to her the love she had forfeited coupled lovingly together they were now sauntering up the walk the sailors arm thrown round the waist of mrs carlyle oh the shameless woman ay she could be bitter enough upon graceless doings when enacted by another but what was her astonishment when she saw mr carlyle advance and that his appearance caused not the slightest change in their gracelessness for the sailors arm was not withdrawn two or three minutes they stoodthe threetalking together in a group then the goodnights were exchanged the sailor left them and mr carlyle his own arm lovingly pressed where the others had been withdrew with his wife the truththat it was barbaras brotherdashed to the mind of lady isabel was i mad she cried with a hollow laugh she false to him no no that fate was reserved for me alone she followed them to the houseshe glanced in at the windows of the drawingroom lights and fire were in the room but the curtains and windows were not closed for the night for it was through those windows that mr carlyle and his wife had passed in and out on their visits to the covered walk there they were alone in their happiness and she stopped to glance in upon it lord mount severn had departed for london to be down again early in the week the tea was on the table but barbara had not begun to make it she sat on the sofa by the fire her face with its ever loving gaze upon it turned up to her husbands he stood near was talking with apparent earnestness and looking down at barbara another moment and a smile crossed his lips the same sweet smile so often bent upon her in the bygone days yes they were together in their unclouded happiness and sheshe turned away toward her own lonely sittingroom sick and faint at heart ball treadman as the brass plate on their office door intimated were conveyancers and attorneys at law mr treadman who attended chiefly to the conveyancing lived at the office with his family mr ball a bachelor lived away lawyer ball west lynne styled him not a young bachelor midway he may have been between forty and fifty a short stout man with a keen face and green eyes he took up any practice that was brought to himdirty odds and ends that mr carlyle would not have touched with his toebut as that gentleman had remarked he could be honest and true upon occasion and there was no doubt that he would be so to richard hare to his house on monday morning early so as to catch him before he went out proceeded mr carlyle a high respect for mr carlyle had lawyer ball as he had had for his father before him many a good turn had the carlyles done him if only helping him and his partner to clients whom they were too fastidious to take up but the two mr carlyle and lawyer ball did not rank alike though their profession was the same lawyer ball knew that they did not and was content to feel humble the one was a received gentleman the other was a country attorney lawyer ball was at breakfast when mr carlyle was shown in halloo carlyle you are here betimes sit still dont disturb yourself dont ring i have breakfasted the most delicious pate de foie urged lawyer ball who was a regular gourmand i get em direct from strasbourg mr carlyle resisted the offered dainty with a smile i have come on business said he not to feast before i enter upon it you will give me your word ball that my communication shall be held sacred in the event of your not consenting to pursue it further certainly i will what business is it some that offends the delicacy of the carlyle office he added with a laugh a wouldbe client whom you turn over to me in your exclusiveness it is a client for whom i cannot act but not from the motives you assume it concerns that affair of hallijohns mr carlyle continued bending forward and somewhat dropping his voice the murder lawyer ball who had just taken in a delicious bonne bouche of the foie gras bolted it whole in his surprise why that was enacted ages and ages ago it is past and done with he exclaimed not done with said mr carlyle circumstances have come to light which tend to indicate that richard hare was innocentthat it was another who committed the murder in conjunction with him interrupted the attorney no alone richard hare had nothing whatever to do with it he was not even present at the time do you believe that asked lawyer ball i have believed it for years then who did do it richard accuses one of the name of thorn many years backten at leasti had a meeting with richard hare and he disclosed certain facts to me which if correct could not fail to prove that he was not guilty since that period this impression has been gradually confirmed by little and by little trifle upon trifle and i would now stake my life upon his innocence i should long ago have moved in this matter hit or miss could i have lighted upon thorn but he was not to be found neither any clue to him and we now know that this name thorn was an assumed one is he to be found he is found he is at west lynne mark you i dont accuse himi do not offer an opinion upon his guilti only state my belief in richards innocence it may have been another who did it neither richard nor thorn it was my firm intention to take richards case up the instant i saw my way clearly in it and now that that time has come i am debarred from doing so what debars you hence i come to you continued mr carlyle disregarding the question i come on the part of richard hare i have seen him lately and conversed with him i gave him my reasons for not personally acting advised him to apply to you and promised to come here and open the matter will you see richard in good faith and hear his story giving the understanding that he shall depart unmolested as he came although you do not decide to entertain the business ill give it with all the pleasure in life freely returned the attorney im sure i dont want to harm poor dick hare and if he can convince me of his innocence ill do my best to establish it of his own tale you must be the judge i do not wish to bias you i have stated my belief in his innocence but i repeat that i give no opinion myself as to who else may be guilty hear his account and then take up the affair or not as you may think fit he would not come to you without your previous promise to hold him harmless to be his friend in short for the time being when i bear this promise to him for you my part is done i give it to you in all honor carlyle tell dick he has nothing to fear from me quite the contrary for if i can befriend him i shall be glad to do it and i wont spare trouble what can possibly be your objection to act for him my objection applies not to richard i would willingly appear for him but i will not take proceedings against the man he accuses if that man is to be denounced and brought before justice i will hold neither act nor part in it the words aroused the curiosity of lawyer ball and he began to turn over all persons likely and unlikely in his mind never according to usage giving a suspicion to the right one i cannot fathom you carlyle you will do that better possibly when richard shall have made his disclosure itsitsnever his own father that he accuses justice hare your wits must be woolgathering ball well so they must to give utterance to so preposterous a notion acquiesced the attorney pushing back his chair and throwing his breakfast napkin on the carpet but i dont know a soul you could object to go against except the justice whats anybody else in west lynne to you in comparison to restoring dick hare to his fair fame i give it up so do i for the present said mr carlyle as he rose and now about the ways and means for your meeting this poor fellow where can you see him is he at west lynne no but i can get a message conveyed to him and he could come when tonight if you like then let him come here to this house he will be perfectly safe so be it my part is now over concluded mr carlyle and with a few more preliminary words he departed lawyer ball looked after him its a queer business one would think dick accuses some old flame of carlylessome demoiselle or dame he darent go against </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxviii the world turned upside down on monday evening the interview between lawyer ball and richard hare took place with some difficulty would the lawyer believe his talenot as to its broad details he saw that he might give credit to them but as to the accusation against sir francis levison richard persisted mentioned every minute particular he could think ofhis meeting him the night of the elopement in bean lane his meetings with him again in london and sir franciss evident fear of him and thence pursuit and the previous saturday nights recognition at the door of the raven not forgetting to tell of the anonymous letter received by justice hare the morning that richard was in hiding at mr carlyles there was no doubt in the world it had been sent by francis levison to frighten mr hare into dispatching him out of west lynne had richard taken refuge in his fathers home none had more cause to keep dick from falling into the hands of justice than francis levison i believe what you sayi believe all you say mr richard touching thorn debated the attorney but its next to impossible to take in so astounding a fact as that he is sir francis levison you can satisfy yourself of the fact from other lips than mine said richard otway bethel could testify to it if he would though i doubt his willingness but theres ebenezer james what does he know about it asked the attorney in surprise ebenezer james is in our office at present he saw thorn often enough in those days and has i hear recognized him as levison you had better inquire of him should </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> should you object to take cause against levison not a bit of it let me be assured that i am upon safe grounds as to the identity of the man and ill proceed in it forthwith levison is an outandout scoundrel as levison and deserves hanging i will send for james at once and hear what he says he concluded after a pause of consideration richard hare started wildly up not while i am here he must not see me for heavens sake consider the peril to me mr ball pooh pooh laughed the attorney do you suppose i have but this one receptionroom we dont let cats into cages where canary birds are kept ebenezer james returned with the messenger dispatched after him youll be sure to find him at the singing saloon mr ball had said and there the gentleman was found is it any copying sir wanted to be done in a hurry cried james when he came in no replied the attorney i wish a question or two answered thats all did you ever know sir francis levison to go by any name but his own yes sir he has gone by the name of thorn a pause when was this it was the autumn when hallijohn was killed thorn used to be prowling about there in an eveningin the wood and at the cottage i mean what did he prowl for ebenezer james laughed for the same reason that several more didi for one he was sweet upon afy hallijohn where was he living at the time i never remember him in west lynne he was not at west lynne sir on the contrary he seemed to take precious good care that west lynne and he kept separate a splendid horse he rode a thoroughbred and he used to come galloping into the wood at dusk get over his chat with miss afy mount and gallop away again where to where did he come from from somewhere toward swainson a ten miles ride afy used to say he had now that he has appeared here in his own plumage of course i can put two and two together and not be at much fault for the exact spot and wheres that asked the lawyer levison park said mr ebenezer theres little doubt he was stopping at his uncles and you know that is close to swainson lawyer ball thought things were becoming cleareror darker whatever you may please to call it he paused again and then put a question impressively james have you any doubt whatever or shadow of doubt that sir francis levison is the same man you know as thorn sir have i any doubt that you are mr ball or that i am eb james retorted mr ebenezer i am as certain of that mans identity as i am of yours are you ready to swear to that fact in a court of justice ready and willing in any court in the world tomorrow if i am called upon very well you may go back to your singing club now keep a silent tongue in your head all close sir answered mr ebenezer james far into the middle of the night sat lawyer ball and richard hare the former chiefly occupied in taking notes of richards statement its half a crochet this objection of carlyles to interfere with levison suddenly uttered richard in the midst of some desultory conversation dont you think so mr ball the lawyer pursed up his lips um a delicate point carlyle was always fastidiously honorable i should go at him thunder and fury in his place but i and carlyle are different the following day tuesday mr ball was much occupied putting to use nearly ebenezer james words that and that together later in the day he took a journey to levison park ferreted out some information and came home again on that same day at evening richard departed for liverpoolhe was done with for the presentmr and mrs carlyle being as before alone cognizant of his address wednesday morning witnessed the arrival again of the earl of mount severn lord vane too the latter ought to have gone back to eton but he had teased and prayed to be allowed to see the fun out meaning the election and that devils discomfiture when he finds himself beaten he surreptitiously added behind his fathers back who was a great stickler for the boys always being gentlemanly so the earl had yielded they arrived as before about breakfasttime having traveled all night subsequently they and mr carlyle walked into west lynne together west lynne was alive and astir the election was to come off that week and people made it their business to be in a bustle over it collectively and individually mr carlyles committee sat at the bucks head and the traffic in and out was enough to wear the stones away the bench of justices were remarkably warm over it neglecting the judicial business and showing themselves at the bucks head windows in purple and scarlet streamers i will be with you in ten minutes said mr carlyle withdrawing his arm from lord mount severns as they approached his office but i must go in and read my letters so the earl went on to the bucks head and lord vane took a foot canter down to the raven to reconnoiter it outside he was uncommonly fond of planting himself where sir francis levisons eyes were sure to fall upon himwhich eyes were immediately dropped while the young gentlemans would be fixed in an audacious stare being lord vaneor it may be more correct to say being the earl of mount severns son and under control he was debarred from dancing and jeering after the yellow candidate as the unwashed gentry of his own age indulged in but his tongue and his feet itched to do it mr carlyle took his seat in his private room opened his letters assorted them marked on the back of some what was to be the purport of their answer and then called in mr dill mr carlyle put the letters in his hand gave some rapid instructions and rose you are in a hurry mr archibald they want me at the bucks head why a curious incident occurred to me last evening sir i was an earwitness to a dispute between levison and otway bethel indeed carelessly replied mr carlyle who was busy at the time looking for something in the deep drawer of the desk and what i heard would go far to hang levison if not bethel as sure as we are here mr archibald they hold the secret of hallijohns murder it appears that levison stop interposed mr carlyle i would prefer not to hear this levison may have murdered him but it is no affair of mine neither shall i make it such old dill felt checkmated meanwhile richard hare suffers mr archibald he observed in a remonstrating tone i am aware he does is it right that the innocent should suffer for the guilty no very wrong but the case is all too common if some one would take up richard hares cause now he might be proved innocent added the old man with a wistful look at mr carlyle it is being taken up dill a pause and a glad look thats the best news i have had for many a day sir but my evidence will be necessary to your case levison im not taking up the case you must carry your news elsewhere it is no affair of mine i say then who is taking it up echoed mr dill in astonishment ball he has had a meeting with richard and is now acting for him under the rose mr dills eyes sparkled is he going to prosecute mr archibald i tell you i know nothingi will know nothing when the affair comes out to the publicif it ever does come outi shall share in the information dill and that is all ah well i can understand but i shall go on to their office at once mr archibald and inform them of what i overheard spoke old dill in vehement decision that is not my affair either laughed mr carlyle it is yours but remember if you do go it is ball not treadman waiting only to give certain orders to the head clerk mr dill proceeded to the office of ball treadman a full hour was he closeted there with the senior partner not until three oclock that afternoon did the justices take their seats on the bench scarcely were they seated when lawyer ball bustled in and craved a secret hearing his application was of the last importance he promised but that the ends of justice might not be defeated it was necessary their worships should entertain it in private he therefore craved the bench to accord it to him the bench consulted looked wise and possibly possessing some latent curiosity themselves upon the point graciously acceded they adjourned to a private room and it was full halfpast four before they came out of it very long faces scared and grim were their worships as if lawyer balls communication had both perplexed and confounded them this is the afternoon we are to meet dr martin at papas office william carlyle had suddenly exclaimed that day at dinner do we walk in madame vine i do not know william mrs carlyle is going to take you no she is not you are going to take me a flush passed over lady isabels face at the bare thought though she did not believe it she go to mr carlyles office mrs carlyle told me herself that she should take you was the reply all i know is mamma told me this morning you would take me to west lynne today persisted william the discussion was interrupted by the appearance of mrs carlyleinterrupted and decided also madame vine she said you will be ready at three oclock to go in with william lady isabels heart beat i understood you to say that you should go with him yourself madame i know i did i intended to do so but i heard this morning that some friends from a distance are coming this afternoon to call upon me therefore i shall not go out how she lady isabel wished that she dare say also i shall not go out either but that might not be well she must go through with it as she had to go through with the rest william rode his pony into west lynne the groom attending to take it back again he was to walk home with madame vine who walked both ways mr carlyle was not in when they arrived at the office the boy went boldly on to the private room leaving madame vine to follow him presently mr carlyle appeared he was talking to mr dill who followed him oh you are here madame vine i left word that you were to go into miss carlyles did i not leave word dill not with me sir i forgot it then i meant to do so what is the time he looked at his watch ten minutes to four did the doctor say at what hour he should call mr carlyle added to madame vine not precisely i gathered that it would be very early in the afternoon here he is exclaimed mr carlyle with alacrity as he went into the hall she supposed he alluded to the physiciansupposed he had seen him pass the window their entrance together woke up william well said the doctor who was a little man with a bald head and how fares it with my young patient bon jour madame bon jour monsieur responded she she wished everybody would address her in french and take her for french there seemed less chance of recognition she would have to speak in good plain english however if she must carry on conversation with the doctor beyond a familiar phrase or two he was something like justice harenong parley fronsay me and how does the codliver oil get on asked the doctor of william as he drew him to the light it is nicer now than it used </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> used to be eh no said william it is nastier than ever dr martin looked at the boy felt his pulse his skin listened to his breathing there said he presently you may sit down and have your nap out i wish i might have something to drink i am very thirsty may i ring for some water papa go and find your aunts maid and ask her for some said mr carlyle ask her for milk called out dr martin not water away went william mr carlyle was leaning against the side of the window dr martin folded his arms before it lady isabel stood near the latter the broad full light was cast upon all but the thick veil hid lady isabels face it was not often she could be caught without that veil for she seemed to wear her bonnet at all sorts of seasonable and unseasonable times what is your opinion doctor asked mr carlyle well began the doctor in a very professional tone the boy is certainly delicate but stay dr martin was the interruption spoken in a low impressive voice you will deal candidly with me i must know the truth without disguise tell it me freely dr martin paused the truth is not always palatable mr carlyle true but for that very reason all the more necessary let me hear the worst and the child has no mother you know to be shocked with it i fear that it will be the worst death ay the seeds of consumption must have been inherent in him they are showing out too palpably is there no hope for the child dr martin looked at him you bade me give you the truth nothing else nothing but the truth returned mr carlyle his tone one of mingled pain and command then there is none no hope whatever the lungs are extensively diseased and how long that i cannot say interrupted the doctor divining what the next question was to be he may linger on for months for a year it may even be or a very short period may see the termination dont worry him with any more lessons and stuff of learning hell never want it the doctor cast his eyes on the governess as he spoke the injunction concerned her as much as it did mr carlyle and the doctor started for he thought she was fainting her face had become so ghastly white he could see it through her veil you are ill madame you are ill trouve malade dont you she opened her lips to speak her trembling lips that would not obey her dr martin in his concern pulled off the blue spectacles she caught them from him with one hand sat down on the nearest chair and hid her face with the other mr carlyle scarcely understanding the scuffle came forward are you ill madame vine she was putting her spectacles under her veil her face whiter than ever pray do not interrupt your conversation to pay attention to me i thank you i thank you both i am subject toslight spasms and they do make me look ill for the moment it has passed now the doctor turned from her mr carlyle resumed his place by the window what should be the treatment asked the latter almost anything you pleasethat the boy himself likes let him play or rest ride or walk eat and drink or let it alone it cannot make much difference doctor you yield it as a last hope very lightly dr martin shook his head i speak as i know you insisted on having my true opinion a warmer climate suggested mr carlyle eagerly the idea crossing his mind it might prolong the end for a little whilea few weeks perhapsavert it it could not and who could take him you could not go and he has no mother no i should not advise it i wish you would see wainwrightwith reference to william i have seen him i met him this afternoon by chance and told him my opinion how is mrs carlyle pretty well she is not in robust health you are aware just now dr martin smiled these things will happen mrs carlyle has a thoroughly good constitution a far stronger one thanthan than what said mr carlyle wondering why he hesitated you must grant me pardon i may as well finish now i have begun but i was not thinking when i spoke she is stronger than was lady isabel i must be off to catch the six train you will come over from time to time to east lynne to see william if you wish it it may be a satisfaction perhaps bon jour madame lady isabel bowed to him as he left the room with mr carlyle how fond that french governess of yours is of the boy the doctor whispered as they crossed the hall i detected it when she brought him to lynneborough and you saw her just now that emotion was all because he could not live goodbye mr carlyle grasped his hand doctor i wish you could save him he passionately uttered ah carlyle if we humble mites of human doctors could but keep those whom it is the great physicians pleasure to take how we should be run after theres hidden mercy remember in the darkest cloud farewell my friend mr carlyle returned to the room he approached lady isabel looking down upon her as she sat not that he could see much of her face these are grievous tidings but you were more prepared for them i fancy than i was she started suddenly up approached the window and looked out as if she saw somebody passing whom she would gaze at all of emotion was stirred up within herher temples throbbed her throat beat her breath became hysterical could she bear thus to hold confidential converse with him over the state of their child she pulled off her gloves for coolness to her burning hands she wiped the moisture from her pale forehead she struggled manfully for calmness what excuse could she offer to mr carlyle i had begun to like the boy so very much sir she said half turning round and the doctors fiat too plainly pronounced has given me pain pain to agitation again mr carlyle approached her following close up to where she stood you are very kind thus to feel an interest in my child she did not answer here papa papa i want you cried william breaking into the room let me walk home with you are you going to walk how could he find it in his heart to deny anything to the child then very well he said stay here till i come for you we are going home with papa proclaimed william to madame vine madame vine did not relish the news but there was no help for it in a very short time mr carlyle appeared and they set off he holding williams hand madame walking on the other side of the child wheres william vane papa asked the boy he has gone on with lord mount severn scarcely had the words been spoken when some one came bolting out of the postoffice and met them face to face almost ran against them in fact creating some hindrance the man looked confused and slunk off into the gutter and you will not wonder that he did when you hear that it was francis levison william child like turned his head to gaze at the intruder i would not be an ugly bad man like him for the world quoth he as he turned his back again would you papa mr carlyle did not answer and isabel cast an involuntary glance upon him from her white face his was impassive save that a cast of ineffable scorn marred the delicate beauty of his lips if humiliation for the past had never wrung lady isabels heart before it would have wrung it then at mr justice hares gate they encountered that gentleman who appeared to be standing there to give himself an airing william caught sight of mrs hare seated on the garden bench outside the window and ran to kiss her all the children loved mrs hare the justice was lookingnot pale that would not be a term half strong enough but yellow the curls of his best wig were limp and all his pomposity appeared to have gone out of him i say carlyle what on earths this cried he in a tone that for him was wonderfully subdued and meek i was not on the bench this afternoon but pinner has been telling meof an application that was made to them in private its not true you know it cant be its too farfetched a tale what do you know about it nothing said mr carlyle i do not know what you are talking of i have been privy to no application it seems they want to make out now that dick never murdered hallijohn proceeded the justice in a half whisper glancing round as if to be sure that there were no eavesdroppers amidst the trees oh said mr carlyle but that levison did levison mr carlyle made no reply save by a gesture his face more impassive than before not so another face beside him a fair face that turned white again with emotion as she listened but it cant be you know it cant i say so far as richards innocence goes of that i have long been convinced spoke mr carlyle and that levisons guilty returned the justice opening his eyes in puzzled wonderment i have no opinion upon that point was the cold rejoinder its impossible i say dick cant be innocent you may as well tell me that the worlds turned upside down it is sometimes i think that richard was not the guilty man will be proved yet justice in the broad face of day ififthat other did do it i should think youd take the warrant out of the hands of the police and capture him yourself i would not touch him with a pair of tongs spoke mr carlyle his lips curling again if the man goes to his punishment he goes but i do not help him on his road thither can dick be innocent mused the justice returning to the thought which so troubled his mind then why has he kept away why did he not come back and say so that you might deliver him up justice you know you took an oath to do it the justice looked green and remarkably humble oh but carlyle impulsively spoke he the thought occurring to him what an awful revenge this would have been for you onsomebodyhad she lived how her false step would have come home to her now false steps come home to most people responded mr carlyle as he took william by the hand who then ran up and lifting his hat to mrs hare in the distance he walked on she lady isabel walked on too by the side of the child as before walked on with a shivering frame and a heart sick unto death the justice looked after her his mind unoccupied he was in a maze of bewilderment richard innocent richard whom he had striven to pursue to a shameful end and that other the guilty one the world was turning upside down </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xxxix mrs carlyle in full dress afy also merrily rose west lynne on thursday morning merrily rang out the bells clashing and chiming the street was alive with people the windows were crowded with heads something unusual was astir it was the day of the nomination of the two candidates and everybody took the opportunity to make a holiday ten oclock was the hour named but before that hour struck west lynne was crammed the country people had come in thick and threefold rich and poor people of note and people of none voters and nonvoters all eager to mix themselves up with the days proceedings you see the notorious fact of sir francis levisons having come forward to oppose mr carlyle caused greater interest in this election than is usual even in small country placesand </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> placesand that need not be barbara drove in her carriage the two children with her and the governess the governess said she preferred to remain at home barbara would not hear of it almost felt inclined to resent it as a slight besides if she took no interest in mr carlyle she must go to take care of lucy she barbara would be too much occupied to look after children so madame vine perforce stepped into the barouche and sat opposite to mrs carlyle her thick veil shading her features and their pallor contrasting with the blue spectacles they alighted at the residence of miss carlyle quite a gathering was already there lady and miss dobede the herberts mrs hare and many others for the house was in a good spot for seeing the fun and all the people were eager to testify their respect to mr carlyle in contradiction to that other one miss carlyle was in full rig a brocaded dress and a scarletandpurple bow in front of it the size of a pumpkin it was about the only occasion in all miss carlyles life that she deemed it necessary to attire herself beyond common barbara wore no bow but she exhibited a splendid bouquet of scarletandpurple flowers mr carlyle had himself given it to her that morning mr carlyle saw them all at the windows of the large upper drawingroom and came in he was then on his way to the townhall shaking hands laughter hearty and hasty good wishes and he quitted the room again barbara stole after him for a sweeter farewell god bless you and prosper you archibald my dearest the business of the day began mr carlyle was proposed by sir john dobede and seconded by mr herbert lord mount severn than whom not a busier man was there would willingly have been proposer and seconder too but he had no local influence in the place sir francis levison was proposed also by two gentlemen of standing the show of hands was declared to be in favor of mr carlyle it just was in favor of him about twenty to one upon which the baronets friends demanded a poll then all was bustle and scuffle and confusion every one tearing away to the hustings which had been fixed in a convenient spot the townhall not affording the accommodation necessary for a poll candidates and proposers and seconders and gentlemen and officers and mob hustling and jostling each other mr carlyle was linked arminarm with sir john dobede sir johns arm was within lord mount severnsbut as to order it was impossible to observe any to gain the place they had to pass the house of miss carlyle young vane who was in the thick of the crowd of course cast his eyes up to its lined windows took off his hat and waved it carlyle and honor forever shouted he the ladies laughed and nodded and shook their handkerchiefs and displayed their scarlet and purple colors the crowd took up the shout till the very air echoed with it carlyle and honor forever barbaras tears were falling but she smiled through them at one pair of loving eyes which sought out hers a galaxy of beauty whispered mr drake in the ear of sir francis how the women rally round him i tell you what levison you and the government were stupid to go on with the contest and i said so days ago you have no more chance against carlyle than that bit of straw has against the wind you ought to have withdrawn in time like a coward angrily returned sir francis no ill go on with it to the last though i do get beaten how lovely his wife is observed mr drake his admiring eyes cast up at barbara i say levison was the first one as charming sir francis looked perfectly savage the allusion did not please him but ere another word could be spoken some one in the garb of a policeman who had wound his way through the crowd laid his hand upon the baronet sir francis levison you are my prisoner nothing worse than debt occurred at that moment to the mind of sir francis but that was quite enough and he turned purple with rage your hands off vermin how dare you a quick movement a slight click a hustle from the wondering crowd more immediately around and the handcuffs were on utter amazement alone prevented mr drake from knocking down the policeman a dozen vituperating tongues assailed him im sorry to do it in this public place and manner spoke the officer partly to sir francis partly to the gentlemen around but i couldnt come across you last night do as i would and the warrant has been in my hands since five oclock yesterday afternoon sir francis levison i arrest you for the wilful murder of george hallijohn the crowd fell back the crowd was paralyzed with consternation the word was passed from one extreme to the other and back and across again and the excitement grew high the ladies looking from miss carlyles windows saw what had happened though they could not divine the cause some of them turned pale at sight of the handcuffs and mary pinner an excitable girl fell into a screaming fit pale what was their gentle paleness compared with the frightfully livid one of francis levison his agitation was pitiable to witness his face a terror to look upon once or twice he gasped as if in an agony and then his eyes happened to fall on otway bethel who stood near shorn of his adornmentswhich might not be thought adornments upon paperthe following was the sentence that burst involuntarily from his lips you hound it is you who have done this no by whether mr otway bethel was about to swear by jupiter or juno never was decided the sentence being cut ignominiously short at the above two words another policeman in the summary manner exercised towards sir francis had clapped a pair of handcuffs upon him mr otway bethel i arrest you as an accomplice in the murder of george hallijohn you may be sure that the whole assembly was arrested toofigurativelyand stood with eager gaze and open ears colonel bethel quitting the scarletandpurple flashed into those of the yellows he knew his nephew was graceless enough butto see him with a pair of handcuffs on what does all this mean he authoritatively demanded of the officers its no fault of ours colonel we have but executed the warrant answered one of them the magistrate issued it yesterday against these two gentlemen on suspicion of their being concerned in the murder of hallijohn in conjunction with richard hare cried the astounded colonel gazing from one to the other prisoners and officers in scared bewilderment its alleged now that richard hare didnt have nothing to do with it returned the man its said he is innocent im sure i dont know i swear that i am innocent passionately uttered otway bethel well sir you have only got to prove it civilly rejoined the policeman miss carlyle and lady isabel leaned from the window their curiosity too much excited to remain silent longer mrs hare was standing by their side what is the matter both asked of the upturned faces immediately beneath them twothe fine member as wanted to be and young bethelbe arrested for murder spoke a mans clear voice in answer the tale runs as they murdered hallijohn and then laid it on the shoulders of young dick hare who didnt do it after all a faint wailing cry of startled pain and barbara flew to mrs hare from whom it proceeded oh mamma my dear mamma take comfort do not suffer this to agitate you to illness richard is innocent and it will surely be so proved archibald she added beckoning to her husband in her alarm come if you can and say a word of assurance to mamma it was impossible that mr carlyle could hear the words but he could see that his wife was greatly agitated and wanted him i will be back with you in a few moments he said to his friends as he began to elbow his way through the crowd which made way when they saw who the elbower was into another room away from the gay visitors they got mrs hare and mr carlyle locked the door to keep them out unconsciously taking out the key only himself and his wife were with her except madame vine in her bonnet who had been dispatched by somebody with a bottle of smelling salts barbara knelt at her mammas feet mr carlyle leaned over her her hands held sympathizingly in his madame vine would have escaped but the key was gone oh archibald tell me the truth you will not deceive me she gasped in earnest entreaty the cold dew gathering on her pale gentle face is the time come to prove my boys innocence it is is it possible that it can be that false bad man who is guilty from my soul i believe him to be replied mr carlyle glancing round to make sure that none could hear the assertion save those present but what i say to you and barbara i would not say to the world whatever be the mans guilt i am not his nemesis dear mrs hare take courage take comforthappier days are coming round mrs hare was weeping silently barbara rose and laid her mammas head lovingly upon her bosom take care of her my darling mr carlyle whispered to his wife dont leave her for a moment and dont let that chattering crew in from the next room i beg your pardon madame his hand had touched madame vines neck in turning roundthat is had touched the jacket that encased it he unlocked the door and regained the street while madame vine sat down with her beating and rebellious heart amidst the shouts the jeers and the escort of the mob sir francis levison and otway bethel were lodged in the stationhouse preparatory to their examination before the magistrates never sure was so mortifying an interruption known so thought sir franciss party and they deemed it well after some consultation amongst themselves to withdraw his name as a candidate for the membership that he never had a shadow of chance from the first most of them knew but theres an incident yet to tell of the election day you have seen miss carlyle in her glory her brocaded silk standing on end with richness her displayed colors her pride in her noble brother but now could youor she which it is more to the purposehave divined who and what was right above her head at an upper window i know not what the consequence would have been no less an eyesore to miss carlyle than that brazen hussy afy hallijohn smuggled in by miss carlyles servants there she wasin full dress too a greenandwhite checked sarcenet flounced up to the waist over a crinoline extending from here to yonder a fancy bonnet worn on the plait of hair behind with a wreath and a veil delicate white gloves and a swinging handkerchief of lace redolent of musk it was well for miss cornys peace of mind ever after that she remained in ignorance of that daring act there stood afy bold as a sunflower exhibiting herself and her splendor to the admiring eyes of the mob below gentle and simple he is a handsome man after all quoth she to miss carlyles maids when sir francis levison arrived opposite the house but such a horrid creature was the response and to think that he should come here to oppose mr archibald whats that cried afy what are they stopping for there are two policemen there oh shrieked afy if they havent put handcuffs on him whatever has he done what can he have been up to where who what cried the servants bewildered with the crowd put handcuffs on which sir francis levison hush what is that they say listening looking turning from white to red from red to white afy stood but she could make nothing of it she could not divine the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> the cause of the commotion the mans answer to miss carlyle and lady dobede clear though it was did not quite reach her ears what did he say she cried good heavens cried one of the maids whose hearing had been quicker than afys he says they are arrested for the wilful murder of halof your father miss afy sir francis levison and otway bethel what shrieked afy her eyes starting levison was the man who did it he says continued the servant bending her ear to listen and young richard hare he says has been innocent all along afy slowly gathered in the sense of the words she gasped twice as if her breath had gone and then with a stagger and a shiver fell heavily to the ground afy hallijohn recovered from her fainting fit had to be smuggled out of miss carlyles as she had been smuggled in she was of an elastic nature and the shock or the surprise or the heat whatever it may have been being over afy was herself again not very far removed from the residence of miss carlyle was a shop in the cheese and ham and butter and bacon line a very respectable shop too and kept by a very respectable mana young man of mild countenance who had purchased the goodwill of the business through an advertisement and come down from london to take possession his predecessor had amassed enough to retire and people foretold that mr jiffin would do the same to say that miss carlyle dealt at the shop will be sufficient to proclaim the good quality of the articles kept in it when afy arrived opposite the shop mr jiffin was sunning himself at the door his shopman inside being at some urgent employment over the contents of a buttercask afy stopped mr jiffin admired her uncommonly and she always ready for anything in that way had already enjoyed several passing flirtations with him good day miss hallijohn cried he warmly tucking up his white apron and pushing it round to the back of his waist in the best manner he could as he held out his hand to her for afy had once hinted in terms of disparagement at that very apron ohhow are you jiffin cried afy loftily pretending not to have seen him standing there and she condescended to put the tips of her white gloves into the offered hand as she coquetted with her handkerchief her veil and her ringlets i thought you would have shut up your shop today mr jiffin and taken a holiday business must be attended to responded mr jiffin quite lost in the contemplation of afys numerous attractions unusually conspicuous as they were had i known that you were abroad miss hallijohn and enjoying a holiday perhaps i might have done it too in the hope of coming across you somewhere or other his words were bona fide as his admiration afy saw that so she could afford to treat him rather de haut en bas and hes as simple as a calf thought she the greatest pleasure i have in life miss hallijohn is to see you go by the shop window continued mr jiffin im sure its like as if the sun itself passed dear me bridled afy with a simper i dont know any good that can do you you might have seen me go by an hour or two agoif you had possessed eyes i was on my way to miss carlyles she continued with the air of one who proclaims the fact of a morning call upon a duchess where could my eyes have been exclaimed mr jiffin in an agony of regret in some of those precious buttertubs i shouldnt wonder we have had a bad lot in miss hallijohn and i am going to return them oh said afy conspicuously resenting the remark i dont know anything about that sort of thing buttertubs are beneath me of course of course miss hallijohn deprecated poor jiffin they are very profitable though to those who understand the trade what is all that shouting cried afy alluding to a tremendous noise in the distance which had continued for some little time its the voters cheering mr carlyle i suppose you know that hes elected miss hallijohn no i didnt the other was withdrawn by his friends so they made short work of it and mr carlyle is our member god bless him theres not many like him but i say miss hallijohn whatever is it that the other one has done murder they say i cant make top nor tail of it of course we know he was bad enough before dont ask me said afy murders not a pleasant subject for a lady to discuss are all these customers dear me youll have enough to do to attend to them your man cant do it all so i wont stay talking any longer with a gracious flourish of her flounces and wave of the handkerchief afy sailed off and mr jiffin when he could withdraw his fascinated eyes from following her turned into his shop to assist in serving four or five servant girls who had entered it it wouldnt be such a bad catch after all soliloquized afy as she and her crinoline swayed along of course id never put my nose inside the shopunless it was to order things like another customer the worst is the name jiffin joe jiffin how could i ever bear to be called mrs joe jiffin not butgoodness me what do you want the interruption to afys chickens was caused by mr ebenezer james that gentleman who had been walking with quick steps to overtake her gave her flounces a twitch behind to let her know somebody had come up how are you afy i was going after you to mrs latimers not knowing but you had returned home i saw you this morning at miss cornys windows now i dont want any of your sauce ebenezer james afying me the other day when you were on with your nonsense i said you should keep your distance you took and told mr jiffin that i was an old sweetheart of yours i heard of it so you were laughed mr ebenezer i never was flashed afy i was the company of your betters in those days and if there had been no betters in the case i should have scorned you why you have been a strolling player and what have you been returned mr ebenezer a quiet tone of meaning running through his goodhumored laughter afys cheeks flushed scarlet and she raised her hand with a quick menacing gesture but that they were in the public street mr ebenezer might have found his ears boxed afy dropped her hand again and made a dead standstill if you think any vile false insinuations that you may concoct will injure me you are mistaken ebenezer james i am too much respected in the place so dont try it on why afy what has put you out i dont want to injure you couldnt do it if i tried as you say he added with another quiet laugh i have been in too many scrapes myself to let my tongue bring other folks into one there thats enough just take yourself off its not over reputable to have you at ones side in public well i will relieve you of my company if youll let me deliver my commission though as to reputablehowever i wont put you out further you are wanted at the justiceroom at three oclock this afternoon and dont fail please wanted at the justiceroom retorted afy i what for and must not fail as i say repeated mr ebenezer you saw levison taken upyour old flame afy stamped her foot in indignant interruption take care what you say ebenezer james flame he ill have you put up for defamation of character dont be a goose afy its of no use riding the high horse with me you know where i saw youand saw him people here said you were with dick hare i could have told them better but i did not it was no affair of mine that i should proclaim it neither is it now levison alias thorn is taken up for your fathers murder and you are wanted to give evidence there thats your subpoena ball thought you would not come without one i will never give evidence against levison she uttered tearing the subpoena to pieces and scattering them in the street i swear i wont there for you will i help to hang an innocent man when it was dick hare who was the guilty one no ill walk myself off a hundred miles away first and stop in hiding till its over i shant forget this turn that you have chosen to play me ebenezer james i chosen why do you suppose i have anything to do with it dont take up that notion afy mr ball put that subpoena in my hand and told me to serve it he might have given it to the other clerk just as he gave it to me it was all chance if i could do you a good turn id do itnot a bad one afy strode on at railroad speed waving him off mind you dont fail afy he said as he prepared to return fail answered she with flashing eyes i shall fail giving evidence if you mean that they dont get me up to their justiceroom neither by force or stratagem ebenezer james stood and looked after her as she tore along what a spirit that afy has got when its put up quoth he shell be doing as she saidmake offunless shes stopped shes a great simpleton nothing particular need come out about her and thorn unless she lets it out herself in her tantrums here comes ball i declare i must tell him on went afy and gained mrs latimers that lady suffering from indisposition was confined to the house afy divesting herself of certain little odds and ends of her finery made her way into mrs latimers presence oh maam such heartrending news as i have had began she a relation of mine is dying and wants to see me i ought to be away by the next train dear me cried mrs latimer after a pause of dismay but how can i

suffering as you are where is it to asked mrs latimer how long shall you be away afy mentioned the first town that came uppermost and hoped she might be back tomorrow what relation is it continued mrs latimer i thought you had no relatives except joyce and your aunt mrs kane this is another aunt cried afy softly i have never mentioned her not being friends differences divided us of course that makes me all the more anxious to obey her request an uncommon good hand at an impromptu tale was afy and mrs latimer consented to her demand afy flew upstairs attired herself once more put one or two things in a small leather bag placed some money in her purse and left the house sauntering idly on the pavement on the sunny side of the street was a policeman he crossed over to afy with whom he had a slight acquaintance goodday miss hallijohn a fine day is it not fine enough returned afy provoked at being hindered i cant talk to you now for i am in a hurry the faster she walked the faster he walked keeping at her side afys pace increased to a run his increased to a run too whatever are you in such haste over asked he well its nothing to you and i am sure i dont want you to dance

up this way repeated afy its the nearest road to the station it cuts off all that corner the officer laid his hand upon her gently afy thought he was venturing upon it in sportas if he deemed her too charming to be parted with what do you mean by your nonsense i tell you i have not time for it now take your hand off me she added grimlyfor the hand was clasping her closer i am sorry to hurt a ladys feelings especially yours miss but i darent take it off and i darent part with you my instructions are to take you on at once to the witnessroom your evidence is wanted this afternoon if you ever saw a ghost more livid than ghosts in ordinary you may picture to your mind the appearance of afy hallijohn just then she did not faint as she had done once before that day but she looked as if she should die one sharp cry instantly suppressed for afy did retain some presence of mind and remembered that she was in the public roadone sharp tussle for liberty over as soon and she resigned herself perforce to her fate i have no evidence to give she said in a calmer tone i know nothing of the facts im sure i dont know anything of them returned the man i dont know why you are wanted when instructions are given us miss we cant ask what they mean i was bid to watch that you didnt go off out of the town and to bring you on to the witnessroom if you attempted it and i have tried to do it

take it off she kept her word afy was no simpleton and knew that she was no match for him she had fallen into the hands of the philistines was powerless and must make the best of it so they walked through the street as if they were taking a quiet stroll he gallantly bearing the leather bag miss carlyles shocked eyes happened to fall upon them as they passed her window she wondered where could be the eyes of the mans inspector </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xl the justiceroom the magistrates took their seats on the bench the bench would not hold them all in the commission of the peace flocked in any other day they would not have been at west lynne as to the room the wonder was how it ever got emptied again so densely was it packed sir francis levisons friends were there in a body they did not believe a word of the accusation a scandalous affair cried they got up probably by some sneak of the scarletandpurple party lord mount severn who chose to be present had a place assigned him on the bench lord vane got the best place he could fight for amid the crowd mr justice hare sat as chairman unusually stern unbending and grim no favor would he show but no unfairness had it been to save his son from hanging he would not adjudge guilt to francis levison against his conscience colonel bethel was likewise on the bench stern also in that primitive placeprimitive in what related to the justiceroom and the justicesthings were not conducted with the regularity of the law the law there was often a dead letter no very grave cases were decided there they went to lynneborough a month at the treadmill or a weeks imprisonment or a bout of juvenile whipping were pretty near the harshest sentences pronounced thus in this examination as in others evidence was advanced that was inadmissibleat least that would have been inadmissible in a more orthodox courthearsay testimony and irregularities of that nature mr rubiny watched the case on behalf of sir francis levison mr ball opened the proceedings giving the account which had been imparted to him by richard hare but not mentioning richard as his informant he was questioned as to whence he obtained his information but replied that it was not convenient at present to disclose the source the stumbling block of the magistrates appeared to be the identifying levison with thorn ebenezer james came forward to prove it what do you know of the prisoner sir francis levison questioned justice herbert not much responded mr ebenezer i used to know him as captain thorn captain thorn afy hallijohn called him captain but i understood he was but a lieutenant from whom did you understand that from afy she was the only person i heard speak of him and you say you were in the habit of seeing him in the place mentioned the abbey wood i saw him there repeatedly also at hallijohns cottage did you speak with him as thorn two or three times i addressed him as thorn and he answered to the name i had no suspicion but that it was his name otway bethelcasting his eyes on mr otway who stood in his shaggy attirealso knew him as thorn and so i have no doubt did locksley for he was always in the wood anybody else poor hallijohn himself knew him as thorn he said to afy one day in my presence that he would not have that confounded dandy thorn coming there were those the words he used they were that confounded dandy thorn i remember afys replyit was rather insolent she said thorn was as free to come there as anybody else and she would not be found fault with as though she was not fit to take care of herself that is nothing to the purpose were any others acquainted with this thorn i should imagine the elder sister joyce was and the one who knew him best of all of us was young richard hare old richard hare from his place on the bench frowned menacingly at an imaginary richard what took thorn into the wood so often he was courting afy with an intention of marrying her wellno cried mr ebenezer with a twist of the mouth i should not suppose he entertained any intention of the sort he used to come over from swainson or its neighborhood riding a splendid horse whom did you suppose him to be i supposed him to be moving in the upper ranks of life there was no doubt of it his dress his manners his tone all proclaimed it he appeared to wish to shun observation and evidently did not care to be seen by any of us he rarely arrived until twilight did you see him there on the night of hallijohns murder no i was not there myself that evening so could not have seen him did a suspicion cross your mind at any time that he may have been guilty of the murder never richard hare was accused of it by universal belief and it never occurred to me to suppose he had not done it pray how many years is this ago sharply interrupted mr rubiny perceiving that the witness was done with lets see responded mr ebenezer i cant be sure as to a year without reckoning up a dozen if not more and you mean to say that you can swear to sir francis levison being that man with all these years intervening i swear that he is the man i am as positive of his identity as i am of my own without having seen him from that time to this derisively returned the lawyer nonsense witness i did not say that returned mr ebenezer the court pricked up its ears have you seen him between then and now asked one of them once where and when it was in london about eighteen months after the period of the trial what communication had you with him none at all i only saw himquite by chance and whom did you suppose him to be thenthorn or levison thorn certainly i never dreamt of his being levison until he appeared here now to oppose mr carlyle a wild savage curse shot through sir franciss heart as he heard the words what demon had possessed him to venture his neck into the lions den there had been a strong hidden power holding him back from it independent of his dislike to face mr carlyle how could he be so mad as to disregard it how could a man go from his doom can any you may have been mistaken witness as to the identity of the man you saw in london it may not have been the thorn you had known here mr ebenezer james smiled a peculiar smile i was not mistaken he said his tone sounding remarkably significant i am upon my oath call aphrodite hallijohn the lady appeared supported by her friend the policeman and mr ebenezer james was desired by mr ball to leave the court while she gave her evidence doubtless he had his reasons what is your name afy replied she looking daggers at everybody and sedulously keeping her back turned upon francis levison and otway bethel you name in full if you please you were not christened afy aphrodite hallijohn you all know my name as well as i do wheres the use of asking useless questions swear the witness spoke up mr justice hare the first word he had uttered i wont be sworn said afy you must be sworn said mr justice herbert but i say i wont repeated afy then we must commit you to prison for contempt of court there was no mercy in his tone and afy turned white sir john dobede interposed young woman had you a hand in the murder of your father i returned afy struggling with passion temper and excitement how dare you ask me such an unnatural question sir he was the kindest father she added battling with her tears i loved him dearly i would have saved his life with mine and yet you refuse to give evidence that may assist in bringing his destroyer to justice no i dont refuse on that score i should like his destroyer to be hanged and id go to see it but who knows what other questions you may be asking me about things that concerned neither you nor anybody else thats why i object we have only to deal with what bears upon the murder the questions put to you will relate to that afy considered well you may swear me then she said little notion had she of the broad gauge those questions would run upon and she was sworn accordingly very unwillingly yet for afy who would have told lies by the bushel unsworn did look upon an oath as a serious matter and felt herself compelled to speak the truth when examined under it how did you become acquainted with a gentleman you often saw in those dayscaptain thorn there uttered the dismayed afy you are beginning already he had nothing to do with ithe did not do the murder you have sworn to answer the questions put was the uncompromising rejoinder how did you become acquainted with captain thorn i met him at swainson doggedly answered afy i went over there one day just for a spree and i met him at a pastrycooks and he fell in love with your pretty face said lawyer ball taking up the examination in the incense to her vanity afy nearly forgot her scruples yes he did she answered casting a smile of general satisfaction round upon the court and got out of you where you lived and entered upon his courting riding over nearly every evening to see you </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense1> you well acknowledged afy there was no harm in it oh certainly not acquiesced the lawyer in a pleasant free tone to put the witness at her ease rather good i should say i wish i had had the like luck did you know him at the time by the name of levison no he said he was captain thorn and i thought he was did you know where he lived no he never said that i thought he was stopping temporarily at swainson anddear me what a sweet bonnet that is you have on afy whose egregious vanity was her besetting sinwho possessed enough of it for any ten pretty women goingcast a glance out of the corners of her eyes at the admired bonnet and became mr balls entirely and how long was it after your first meeting with him before you discovered his real name not for a long timeseveral months subsequent to the murder i presume oh yes mr balls eyes gave a twinkle and the unconscious afy surreptitiously smoothed with one finger the glossy parting of her hair besides captain thorn what gentlemen were in the wood the night of the murder richard hare was there otway bethel and locksley also those were all i saw until the crowd came were locksley and mr otway bethel martyrs to your charms as the other two were no indeed was the witnesss answer with an indignant toss of the head a couple of poaching fellows like them they had better have tried it on which of the two hare or thorn was inside the cottage with you that evening afy came out of her vanity and hesitated she was beginning to wonder where the questions would get to you are upon your oath witness thundered mr justice hare if it was myif it was richard hare who was with you say so but there must be no equivocation here afy was startled it was thorn she answered to mr ball and where was richard hare i dont know he came down but i sent him away i would not admit him i dare say he lingered in the wood did he leave a gun with you yes it was one he had promised to lend my father i put it down just inside the door he told me it was loaded how long after this was it that your father interrupted you he didnt interrupt us at all returned afy i never saw my father until i saw him dead were you not in the cottage all the time no we went out for a stroll at the back captain thorn wished me goodbye there and i stayed out did you hear the gun go off i heard a shot as i was sitting on the stump of a tree and was thinking but i attached no importance to it never supposing it was in the cottage what was it that captain thorn had to get from the cottage after he quitted you what had he left there now this was a random shaft lawyer ball a keen man who had well weighed all points in the tale imparted to him by richard as well as other points had colored them with his own deductions and spoke accordingly afy was taken in he had left his hat therenothing else it was a warm evening and he had gone out without it he told you i believe sufficient to convince you of the guilt of richard hare another shaft thrown at random i did not want convincingi knew it without everybody else knew it to be sure equably returned lawyer ball did captain thorn see it donedid he tell you that he had got his hat and was away down the wood some little distance when he heard voices in dispute in the cottage and recognized one of them to be that of my father the shot followed close upon it and he guessed some mischief had been done though he did not suspect its extent thorn told you thiswhen the same nightmuch later how came you to see him afy hesitated but she was sternly told to answer the question a boy came up to the cottage and called me out and said a strange gentleman wanted to see me in the wood and had given him sixpence to come for me i went and found captain thorn he asked me what the commotion was about and i told him richard hare had killed my father he said that now i spoke of him he could recognize richard hares as having been the other voice in the dispute what boy was thatthe one who came for you it was mother whitemans little son and captain thorn then gave you this version of the tragedy it was the right version resentfully spoke afy how do you know that oh because im sure it was who else would kill him but richard hare it is a scandalous shame your wanting to put it upon thorn look at the prisoner sir francis levison is it he whom you knew as thorn yes but that does not make him guilty of the murder of course it does not complacently assented lawyer ball how long did you remain with captain thorn in londonupon that little visit you know afy started like anybody moonstruck when you quitted this place after the tragedy it was to join captain thorn in london how long i ask did you remain with him entirely a random shaft this but richard had totally denied to lawyer ball the popular assumption that afy had been with him who says i was with him who says i went after him flashed afy with scarlet cheeks i do replied lawyer ball taking notes of her confusion come its over and done withits of no use to deny it now we all go upon visits to friends sometimes i never heard anything so bold cried afy where will you tell me i went next you are upon your oath woman again interposed justice hare and a trembling as of agitation might be detected in his voice in spite of its ringing severity were you with the prisoner levison or were you with richard hare i with richard hare cried afy agitated in her turn and shaking like an aspenleaf partly with discomfiture partly with unknown dread how dare that cruel falsehood be brought up again to my face i never saw richard hare after the night of the murder i swear it i swear that i never saw him since visit him id sooner visit calcraft the hangman there was truth in the wordsin the tone the chairman let fall the hand which had been raised to his face holding on his eyeglasses and a sort of selfcondemning fear arose confusing his brain his son proved innocent of one part might be proved innocent of the other and thenhow would his own harsh conduct show out west lynne in its charity the justice in his had cast more odium to richard with regard to his after conduct touching this girl than it had on the score of the murder come said lawyer ball in a coaxing tone let us be pleasant of course you were not with richard harewest lynne is always illnaturedyou were on a visit to captain thorn asas any other young lady might be afy hung her head cowed down to abject meekness answer the question came forth the chairmans voice again were you with thorn yes though the answer was feeble enough mr ball coughed an insinuating cough did you remain with himsay two or three years not three a little over two perhaps there was no harm in it shrieked afy with a catching sob of temper if i chose to live in london and he chose to make a morning call upon me now and then as an old friend whats that to anybody where was the harm i ask certainlywhere was the harm i am not insinuating any returned lawyer ball with a wink of the eye furthest from the witness and the bench and during the time thatthat he was making these little morning calls upon you did you know him to be levison yes i knew him to be captain levison then did he ever tell you why he had assumed the name of thorn only for a whim he said the day he spoke to me in the pastrycooks shop at swainson something came over him in the spur of the moment not to give his right name so he gave the first that came into his head he never thought to retain it or that other people would hear of him by it i dare say not laconically spoke lawyer ball well miss afy i believe that is all for the present i want ebenezer james in again he whispered to an officer of the justiceroom as the witness retired ebenezer james reappeared and took afys place you informed their worships just now that you had met thorn in london some eighteen months subsequent to the murder began lawyer ball launching another of his shafts this must have been during the period of afy hallijohns sojourn with him did you also see her mr ebenezer opened his eyes he knew nothing of the evidence just given by afy and wondered how on earth it had come outthat she had been with thorn at all he had never betrayed it afy stammered he yes afy sharply returned the lawyer their worships know that when she took that trip of hers from west lynne it was to join thorn not richard harethough the latter has borne the credit of it i ask you did you see her for she was then still connected with him wellyes i did replied mr ebenezer his own scruples removed but wondering still how it had been discovered unless afy hadas he had prophesied she wouldlet out in her tantrums in fact it was afy whom i first saw state the circumstances i was up paddington way one afternoon and saw a lady going into a house it was afy hallijohn she lived there i foundhad the drawingroom apartments she invited me to stay to tea with her and i did did you see captain levison there i saw thornas i thought him to be afy told me i must be away by eight oclock for she was expecting a friend who sometimes came to sit with her for an hours chat but in talking over old timesnot that i could tell her much about west lynne for i had left it almost as long as she hadthe time slipped on past the hour when afy found that out she hurried me off and i had barely got outside the gate when a cab drove up and thorn alighted from it and let himself in with a latchkey that is all i know when you knew that the scandal of afys absence rested on richard hare why could you not have said this and cleared him on your return to west lynne it was no affair of mine that i should make it public afy asked me not to say i had seen her and i promised her i would not as to richard hare a little extra scandal on his back was nothing while there remained on it the worse scandal of murder stop a bit interposed mr rubiny as the witness was about to retire you speak of the time being eight oclock in the evening sir was it dark yes then how can you be certain it was thorn who got out of the cab and entered i am quite certain there was a gaslamp right at the spot and i saw him as well as i should have seen him in daylight i knew his voice too could have sworn to it anywhere and i would almost have sworn to him by his splendid diamond ring it flashed in the lamplight his voice did he speak to you no but he spoke to the cabman there was a half dispute between them the man said thorn had not paid him enough that he had not allowed for having been kept </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> kept waiting twenty minutes on the road thorn swore at him a bit and then flung him an extra shilling the next witness was a man who had been groom to the late sir peter levison he testified that the prisoner francis levison had been on a visit to his master late in the summer and part of the autumn the year that hallijohn was killed that he frequently rode out in the direction of west lynne especially toward evening would be away three or four hours and come home with the horse in a foam also that he picked up two letters at different times which mr levison had carelessly let fall from his pocket and returned them to him both the notes were addressed captain thorn but they had not been through the post for there was no further superscription on them and the writing looked like a ladys he remembered quite well hearing of the murder of hallijohn the witness added in answer to a question it made a great stir through out the country it was just at that same time that mr levison concluded his visit and returned to london a wonderful memory mr rubiny sarcastically remarked the witness a quiet respectable man replied that he had a good memory but that circumstances had impressed upon it particularly the fact that mr levisons departure followed close upon the murder of hallijohn one day when sir peter was round at the stables gentlemen he was urging his nephew to prolong his visit and asked what sudden freak was taking him off mr levison replied that unexpected business called him to london while they were talking the coachman came up all in a heat telling that hallijohn of west lynne had been murdered by young mr hare i remember sir peter said he could not believe it and that it must have been an accident not murder is that all there was more said mr levison in a shameful sort of manner asked his uncle would he let him have five or ten pounds sir peter seemed angry and asked what had he done with the fiftypound note he had made him a present of only the previous morning mr levison replied that he had sent that away to a brother officer to whom he was in debt sir peter refused to believe it and said he had more likely squandered it upon some disgraceful folly mr levison denied that he had but he looked confused indeed his matter altogether was confused that morning did he get the five or ten pounds i dont know gentlemen i dare say he did for my master was as persuadable as a woman though hed fly out a bit sometimes at first mr levison departed for london that same night the last witness called was mr dill on the previous tuesday evening he had been returning home from spending an hour at mr beauchamps when in a field opposite to mr justice hares he suddenly heard a commotion it arose from the meeting of sir francis levison and otway bethel the former appeared to have been enjoying a solitary moonlight ramble and the latter to have encountered him unexpectedly words ensued bethel accused sir francis of shirking him sir francis answered angrily that he knew nothing of him and nothing he wanted to know you were glad enough to know something of me the night of hallijohns murder retorted bethel to this do you remember that i could hang you one little word from me and youd stand in dick hares place you fool passionately cried sir francis you couldnt hang me without putting your own head in a noose did you not have your hush money are you wanting to do me out of more a cursed paltry note of fifty pounds foamed otway bethel which many a time since i have wished my fingers were blown off before they touched i never should have touched it but that i was altogether overwhelmed with the moments confusion i have not been able to look mrs hare in the face since knowing that i held the secret that would save her son from the hangman and put yourself in his place sneered sir francis no put you thats as it might be but if i went to the hangman you would go with me there would be no excuse or escape for you you know it the warfare continued longer but this was the cream of it mr dill heard the whole and repeated it now to the magistrate mr rubiny protested that it was inadmissible hearsay evidence contrary to law but the bench oracularly put mr rubiny down and told him they did not want any stranger to come there and teach them their business colonel bethel had leaned forward at the conclusion of mr dills evidence dismay on his face agitation in his voice are you sure that you made no mistakethat the other in this interview was otway bethel mr dill sadly shook his head am i one to swear to a wrong man colonel i wish i had not heard itsave that it may be the means of clearing richard hare sir francis levison had braved out the proceedings with a haughty cavalier air his delicate hands and his diamond ring remarkably conspicuous was that stone the real thing or a false one substituted for the real hard up as he had long been for money the suspicion might arise a derisive smile crossed his features at parts of the evidence as much as to say you may convict me as to mademoiselle afy but you cant as to the murder when however mr dills testimony was given what a change was there his mood tamed down to what looked like abject fear and he shook in his shoes as he stood of course your worships will take bail for sir francis said mr rubiny at the close of the proceedings bail the bench looked at one another your worships will not refuse ita gentleman in sir francis levisons position the bench thought they never had so insolent an application made to them bail for himon this charge no not if the lord chancellor himself came down to offer it mr otway bethel conscious probably that nobody would offer bail for him not even the colonel did not ask the bench to take it so the two were fully committed to take their trial for the wilful murder otherwise the killing and slaying of george hallijohn and before night would be on their road to the county prison at lynneborough and that vain illstarred afy what of her well afy had retreated to the witnessroom again after giving evidence and there she remained to the close agreeably occupied in a mental debate what would they make out from her admission regarding her sojourn in london and the morning calls how would that precious west lynne construe it she did not much care she would brave it out and assail them with towering indignation did any dare to cast a stone at her such was her final decision arrived at just as the proceedings terminated afy was right glad to remain where she was till some of the bustle had gone how was it ended asked she of mr ball who being a bachelor was ever regarded with much graciousness by afy for she kept her eyes open to contingencies although mr joe jiffin was held in reserve they are both committed for wilful murderoff to lynneborough within an hour afys color rose what a shame to commit two innocent men upon such a charge i can tell you what miss afy the sooner you disabuse your mind of that prejudice the better levison has been as good as proved guilty today but if proof were wanting he and bethel have criminated each other when rogues fall out honest men get their own not that i can quite fathom bethels share in the exploit though i can pretty well guess at it and in proving themselves guilty they have proved the innocence of richard hare afys face was changing to whiteness her confident air to one of dread her vanity to humiliation itcantbetrue she gasped its true enough the part you have hitherto ascribed to thorn was enacted by richard hare he heard the shot from his place in the wood and saw thorn run ghastly trembling horrified from his wicked work believe me it was thorn who killed your father afy grew cold as she listened that one awful moment when conviction that his words were true forced itself upon her was enough to sober her for a whole lifetime thorn her sight failed her head reeled her very heart turned to sickness one struggling cry of pain and for the second time that day afy hallijohn fell forward in a fainting fit shouts hisses execrations yells the prisoners were being brought forth to be conveyed to lynneborough a whole posse of constables was necessary to protect them against the outbreak of the mob which outbreak was not directed against otway bethel but against sir francis levison cowering like the guilty culprit that he was shivered he hiding his white facewondering whether it would be a repetition of justice hares green pond or tearing him asunder piecemealand cursing the earth because it did not open and let him in </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xli firm miss lucy was en penitence she had been guilty of some childish fault that day at aunt cornelias which coming to the knowledge of mrs carlyle after their return home the young lady was ordered to the nursery for the rest of the day and to be regaled upon bread and water barbara was in her pleasant dressingroom there was to be a dinner party at east lynne that evening and she had just finished dressing very lovely looked she in her dinner dress with purple and scarlet flowers in her bosom she glanced at her watch somewhat anxiously for the gentlemen had not made their appearance halfpast six and they were to dine at seven madame vine tapped at the door her errand was to beg grace for lucy she had been promised half an hour in the drawingroom when the ladies entered it from the desserttable and was now in agony of grief at the disappointment would mrs carlyle pardon her and allow her to be dressed you are too lenient to the child madame spoke barbara i dont think you ever would punish her at all but when she commits faults they must be corrected she is very sorry for her fault she promises not to be rude again she is crying as if she would cry her heart out not for her illbehavior but because shes afraid of missing the drawingroom tonight cried barbara do pray restore her to favor pleaded madame i shall see just look madame vine i broke this a minute or two ago is it not a pity barbara held in her hand a beautiful toilette ornament set in pure gold one of the petals had come off madame vine examined it i have some cement upstairs that would join it she exclaimed i could do it in two minutes i bought it in france oh i wish you would was barbaras delighted response do bring it here and join it now shall i bribe you she added laughing you make this all right and then you shall bear back grace to lucyfor i perceive that is what your heart is set upon madame vine went and returned with her cement barbara watched her as she took the pieces in her hand to see how the one must fit on to the other this has been broken once as joyce tells me barbara said but it must have been imperceptibly joined for i have looked in vain for the damage mr carlyle bought it for his first wife when they were in london after their marriage she broke it subsequently here at east lynne you will never do it madame vine if your hand shakes like that what is the matter a great deal was the matter first the ominous words had been upon her tongue it was here where the stem </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> stem joins the flower but she recollected herself in time next came up the past vision of the place and hour when the accident occurred her hanging sleeve had swept it off the table mr carlyle was in the room and he had soothed her sorrowher almost childish sorrow with kisses sweet ah me poor thing i think our hands would have shaken as hers did the ornament and the kisses were barbaras now i ran quickly up the stairs and back again was the explanation she offered to mrs carlyle for her shaking hands at that moment mr carlyle and their guests were heard to return and ascend to their respective apartments lord vanes gleeful voice echoing through the house mr carlyle came into his wifes dressingroom and madame vine would have made a precipitate retreat no no said barbara finish it now you have begun mr carlyle will be going to his room look at the misfortune i have had archibald i have broken this mr carlyle glanced carelessly at the trinket and at madame vines white fingers he crossed to the door of his dressingroom and opened it then held out his hand in silence for barbara to approach and drew her in with him madame vine went on with her work presently barbara returned and approached the table where stood madame vine while she drew on her gloves her eyelashes were wet i could not help shedding a few tears of joy exclaimed barbara with a pretty blush perceiving that madame observed the signs mr carlyle has been telling me that my brothers innocence is now all but patent to the world it came out upon the examination of those two men sir francis and otway bethel lord mount severn was present at the proceedings and says they have in some way incriminated each other papa sat in his place as chairman i wonder that he liked to do so lower bent the head of madame vine over her employment has anything been proved against them she asked in her usual soft tone almost a whisper there is not the least doubt of the guilt of levison but otway bethels share in the affair is a puzzle yet replied mrs carlyle both are committed for trial oh that man that man how his sins come out she continued in excitement madame vine glanced up through her spectacles would you believe continued barbara dropping her voice that while west lynne and i fear ourselves also gave that miserable afy credit for having gone away with richard she was all the time with levison ball the lawyer got her to confess today i am unacquainted with the details mr carlyle would not give them to me he said the bare fact was quite enough and considering the associations it involved would not do to talk of mr carlyle was right out it seems to come little by little one wickedness after another resumed barbara i do not like mr carlyle to hear it no i dont of course there is no help for it but he must feel it terribly as must also lord mount severn she was his wife you know and the children are hers and to think that shei mean hemust feel it for her went on barbara after her sudden pause and there was some hauteur in her tone lest she should be misunderstood mr carlyle is one of the very few men so entirely noble whom the sort of disgrace reflected from lady isabels conduct cannot touch the carriage of the first guest barbara ran across the room and rattled at mr carlyles door archibald do you hear back came the laughing answer i shant keep them long but they may surely accord a few minutes grace to a man who has just been converted into an m p barbara descended to the drawingroom leaving her that unhappy lady to the cement and the broken pieces and to battle as best she could with her bitter heart nothing but stabs nothing but stabs was her punishment ever to end no the step she had taken in coming back to east lynne had precluded that the guests arrived all save mr and mrs hare barbara received a note from her instead the justice did not feel well enough to join them i should think he did not a pleasant party it was at east lynne and twelve oclock struck before the carriage of the last guest drove away it may have been from one to two hours after that and the house was steeped in moonlight and quietness everybody being abed and asleep when a loud summons at the hall bell echoed through the stillness the first to put her head out the window was wilson is it fire shrieked she in the most excessive state of terror conceivable wilson had a natural dread of firesome people do possess this dread more than othersand had oftentime aroused the house to a commotion by declaring she smelt it is it fire shrieked wilson yes was shouted at the top of a mans voice who stepped from between the entrance pillars to answer wilson waited for no more clutching at the baby with one handa fine young gentleman now of near twelve months old promising fair to be as great a source of trouble to wilson and the nursery as was his brother archibald whom he greatly resembledand at archie with the other out she flew to the corridor screeching fire fire fire never ceasing down tore wilson with the four children and burst unceremoniously into the sleeping apartment of mr and mrs carlyle by this time the children terrified out of their senses not at wilsons cry of alarm but at the summary propelling downstairs set up a shrieking too madame vine believing that half the house as least was in flames was the next to appear throwing on a shawl she had caught up and then came joyce fire fire fire shouted wilson we are all being burnt up together poor mrs carlyle thus wildly aroused from sleep sprang out of bed and into the corridor in her nightdress everybody else was in a nightdresswhen folks are flying for dear life they dont stop to look for their dresscoats and best blonde caps out came mr carlyle who has hastily assumed his pantaloons he cast a rapid glance down to the hall and saw that the stairs were perfectly free for escape therefore to hurry was not so violent every soul around him was shrieking in concert making the confusion and din terrific the bright moonlight streamed in at the corridor windows but there was no other light shadowy and indistinct enough looked the white figures where is the fire he exclaimed i dont smell any who gave the first alarm the bell answered him the hallbell which rang out ten times louder and longer than before he opened one of the windows and leaned from it whos there madame vine caught up archie its me sir responded a voice which he at once recognized to be that of one of mr hares menservants master has been took in a fit sir and mistress sent me for you and miss barbara you must please make haste sir if you want to see him alive miss barbara it was more familiar to jasper in a moment of excitement than the new name you jasper is the house on firethis house well i dont know sir i can hear a dreadful deal of screeching in it mr carlyle closed the window he began to suspect that the danger lay in fear alone who told you there was fire he demanded of wilson that man ringing at the door sobbed wilson thank goodness i have saved the children mr carlyle felt somewhat exasperated at the mistake his wife was trembling from head to foot her face of a deadly whiteness and he knew that she was not in a condition to be alarmed necessarily or unnecessarily she clung to him in terror asking if they could escape my darling be calm theres no fire its a stupid mistake you may all go back to bed and sleep in peace he added to the rest and the next time that you alarm the house in the night wilson have the goodness to make yourself sure first of all that theres cause for it barbara frightened still bewildered and uncertain escaped to the window and threw it open but mr carlyle was nearly as quick as she he caught her to him with one hand and drew the window down with the other to have these tidings told to her abruptly would be worse than all by this time some of the servants had descended the other staircase with a light being in various stages of costume and hastened to open the halldoor jasper entered the man had probably waited to help to put out the fire barbara caught sight of him ere mr carlyle could prevent it and grew sick with fear believing some ill had happened to her mother drawing her inside their chamber he broke the news to her soothingly and tenderly making light of it she burst into tears you are not deceiving me archibald papa is not dead dead cheerfully echoed mr carlyle in the same tone he might have used had barbara wondered whether the justice was taking a night airing for pleasure in a balloon wilson has indeed frightened you love dress yourself and we will go and see him at that moment barbara recollected william strange that she should have been the first to do sobefore lady isabelbefore mr carlyle she ran out again to the corridors where the boy stood shivering he may have caught his death she uttered snatching him up in her arms oh wilson what have you done his nightgown is damp and cold unfit as she was for the burden she bore him to her own bed wilson was not at leisure to attend to reproaches just then she was engaged in a wordy war with jasper leaning over the balustrades to carry it on i never told you there was a fire indignantly denied jasper you did i opened the nursery window and called out is it fire and you answered yes you called out is it jasper what else should i say but yes to that fire where was the fire likely to bein the park wilson take the children back to bed authoritatively spoke mr carlyle as he advanced to look down into the hall john are you there the close carriage instantlylook sharp madame vine pray dont continue to hold that heavy boy joyce cant you relieve madame in crossing back to his room mr carlyle had brushed past madame and noticed that she appeared to be shaking as with the weight of archibald in reality she was still alarmed not understanding yet the cause of the commotion joyce who comprehended it as little and had stood with her arms round lucy advanced to take archibald and mr carlyle disappeared barbara had taken off her own warm nightgown then and put it upon william in place of his cold onehad struck a light and was busily dressing herself just feel his nightgown archibald wilson a shrill cry of awful terror interrupted the words and mr carlyle made one bound out again barbara followed the least she thought was that wilson had dropped the baby in the hall that was not the catastrophe wilson with the baby and lucy had already disappeared up the staircase and madame vine was disappearing archibald lay on the soft carpet of the corridor where madame had stood for joyce in the act of taking him had let him slip to the groundlet him fall from sheer terror she held on to the balustrades her face ghastly her mouth open her eyes fixed in horroraltogether an object to look upon archie gathered himself on his sturdy legs and stood staring why joyce what is the matter with you cried mr carlyle you look as if you had seen a spectre oh master she wailed i have seen one are you all going deranged together retorted he wondering what had come to the house seen </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> seen a spectre joyce joyce fell on her knees as if unable to support herself and crossed her shaking hands upon her chest had she seen ten spectres she could not have betrayed more dire distress she was a sensible and faithful servant one not given to flights of fancy and mr carlyle gazed at her in very amazement joyce what is this he asked bending down and speaking kindly oh my dear master heaven have mercy upon us all was the inexplicable answer joyce i ask you what is this she made no reply she rose up shaking and taking archies hand slowly proceeded toward the upper stairs low moans breaking from her and the boys naked feet pattering on the carpet what can ail her whispered barbara following joyce with her eyes what did she mean about a spectre she must have been reading a ghostbook said carlyle wilsons folly has turned the house topsyturvy make your haste barbara spring waned summer came and would soon be waning too for the hot days of july were now in what had the months brought forth since the election of mr carlyle in april be you very sure they had not been without their events mr justice hares illness had turned out to be a stroke of paralysis people cannot act with unnatural harshness toward a child and then discover they have been in the wrong with impunity thus it proved with mr justice hare he was recovering but would never again be the man he had been the fright when jasper had gone to tell of his illness at east lynne and was mistaken for fire had done nobody any damage save william and joyce william had caught a cold which brought increased malady to the lungs and joyce seemed to have caught fear she went about more like one in a dream than awake would be buried in a reverie for an hour at a time and if suddenly spoken to would start and shiver mr carlyle and his wife departed for london immediately that mr hare was pronounced out of danger which was in about a week from the time of his seizure william accompanied them partly for the benefit of london advice partly that mr carlyle would not be parted from him joyce went in attendance with some of the servants they found london ringing with the news of sir francis levisons arrest london could not understand it and the most wild and improbable tales were in circulation the season was at its height the excitement in proportion it was more than a nine days wonder on the very evening of their arrival a lady young and beautiful was shown in to the presence of mr and mrs carlyle she had declined to give her name but there arose to mr carlyles memory when he looked upon her one whom he had seen in earlier days as the friend of his first wifeblanche challoner it was not blanche however the stranger looked keenly at mr carlyle he was standing with his hat in his hand on the point of going out will you pardon this intrusion she asked i have come to you as one human being in need comes to crave help of another i am lady levison barbaras face flushed mr carlyle courteously invited the stranger to a chair remaining standing himself she sat for a moment and then rose evidently in an excess of agitation yes i am lady levison forced to call that man husband that he has been a wicked man i have long known but now i hear he is a criminal i hear it i say but i can get the truth from none i went to lord mount severn he declined to give me particulars i heard that mr carlyle would be in town today and i resolved to come and ask them of him she delivered the sentences in a jerking abrupt tone betraying her inward emotion mr carlyle looking somewhat unapproachable made no immediate reply you and i have both been deeply wronged by him mr carlyle but i brought my wrong upon myself you did not my sister blanche whom he had cruelly treatedand if i speak of it i only speak of what is known to the worldwarned me against him mrs levison his grandmother that ancient lady who must now be bordering upon ninety she warned me the night before my wedding day she came on purpose to tell me that if i married francis levison i should rue it for life there was yet time to retract she said yes there would have been time but there was no will i would not listen to either i was led away by vanity by folly by something worsethe triumphing over my own sister poor blanche but which has the best of the bargain now she or i and i have a child she continued dropping her voice a boy who inherits his fathers name mr carlyle will they condemn him nothing as yet is positively proved against him replied mr carlyle compassionating the unhappy lady if i could but get a divorce she passionately uttered apparently losing all selfcontrol i might have got one over and over again since we married but there would have been the expose and the scandal if i could but change my childs name tell medoes any chance of redress remain for me there was none and mr carlyle did not attempt to speak of any he offered a few kind words of sympathy very generally expressed and then prepared to go out she moved and stood in his way you will not leave until you have given me the particulars i pray you do not i came trustingly to you hoping to know them i am waited for to keep an important engagement he answered and were my time at liberty i should decline to tell them to you on my own account as well as on yours lay not discourtesy to my charge lady levison were i to speak of the man even to you his name would blister my lips in every word of hate spoken by you i would sympathize every contemptuous expression of scorn cast upon him from your heart i would join in tenfold barbara was shocked he is your husband after all she took leave to whisper my husband broke forth lady levison in agitation seemingly yes theres the wrong why did he knowing what he was delude me into becoming his wife you ought to feel for me mrs carlyle and you do feel for me for you are a wife and mother how dare these base men marrytake to themselves an innocent inexperienced girl vowing before god to love and honor and cherish her were not his other sins impediment enough but he must have crime also and woo me he has done me deep and irredeemable wrong and has entailed upon his child an inheritance of shame what had he or i done to deserve it i ask barbara felt half frightened at her vehemence and barbara might be thankful not to understand it all her native gentleness all her reticence of feeling as a wife and a gentlewoman had been goaded out of her the process had been going on for some time but this last revelation was the crowning point and alice lady levison turned round upon the world in her helpless resentment as any poor wife working in a garret might have done there are certain wrongs which bring out human nature in the highborn as well as in the low still he is your husband was all barbara could with deprecation again plead he made himself my husband by deceit and i will throw him off in the face of day returned lady levison there is no moral obligation why i should not he has worked ill and ruinill and ruin upon me and my child and the world shall never be allowed to think i have borne my share in it how was it you kept your hands off him when he reappeared to brave you in west lynne she added in a changed tone turning to mr carlyle i cannot tell i was a marvel oftentimes to myself he quitted the room as he spoke adding a few civil words about her with mrs carlyle barbara not possessing the scruples of her husband yielded to lady levisons request and gave her the outline of the dark tale its outline only and generously suppressing afys name beyond the evening of the fatal event lady levison listened without interruption do you and mr carlyle believe him to have been guilty yes but mr carlyle will not express his opinion to the world he does not repay wrong with revenge i have heard him say that if the lifting of his finger would send the man to his punishment he would tie down his hand rather than lift it was his first wife isabel vane mad she presently asked mad echoed barbara in surprise when she quitted him for the other it could have been nothing else than madness i could understand a womans flying from him for love of mr carlyle but now that i have seen your husband i cannot understand the reverse side of the picture i thank you for your courtesy mrs carlyle and without another word alice levison quitted the room as abruptly as she had entered it well the london visit came to an end it was of little more than three weeks duration for barbara must be safe at home again mr carlyle remained for the rest of the season alone but he varied it with journeys to east lynne he had returned home for good now july although the session had not quite terminated there was another baby at east lynne a lovely little baby pretty as barbara herself had been at a month old william was fading rapidly the london physicians had but confirmed the opinion of dr martin and it was evident to all that the close would not be long protracted somebody else was fadinglady isabel the cross had been too heavy and she was sinking under its weight can you wonder at it an intensely hot day it was under the july sun afy hallijohn was sailing up the street in its beams finer and vainer than ever she encountered mr carlyle so afy you are really going to be married at last jiffin fancies so sir i am not sure yet but what i shall change my mind jiffin thinks theres nobody like me if i could eat gold and silver hed provide it and hes as fond as fond can be but then you know sir hes half soft soft as to you perhaps laughed mr carlyle i consider him a very civil respectable man afy and then i never did think to marry a shopkeeper grumbled afy i looked a little higher than that only fancy sir having a husband who wears a white apron tied round him terrible responded mr carlyle with a grave face not but what it will be a tolerable settlement rejoined afy veering round a point hes having his house done up in style and i shall keep two good servants and do nothing myself but dress and subscribe to the library he makes plenty of money a very tolerable settlement i should say returned mr carlyle and afys face fell before the glance of his eye merry though it was take care you dont spend all his money for him afy ill take care of that nodded afy significantly sir she somewhat abruptly added what is it thats the matter with joyce i do not know said mr carlyle becoming serious there does appear to be something the matter with her for she is much changed i never saw anybody so changed in my life exclaimed afy i told her the other day that she was just like one who had got some dreadful secret upon their mind it is really more like that than anything else observed mr carlyle but she is one of the close ones is joyce continued afy no fear that shell give out a clue </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> clue if it does not suit her to do so she told me in answer to mind my own business and not to take absurd fancies in my head how is the baby sir and mrs carlyle all well good day afy </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlii the trial spacious courts were the assize courts of lynneborough and it was well they were so otherwise more people had been disappointed and numbers were of hearing the noted trial of sir francis levison for the murder of george hallijohn the circumstances attending the case caused it to bear for the public an unparalleled interest the rank of the accused and his antecedents more especially that particular local antecedent touching the lady isabel carlyle the verdict still out against richard hare the length of time which had elapsed since the part played in it by afy the intense curiosity as to the part taken in it by otway bethel the speculation as to what had been the exact details and the doubt of a convictionall contributed to fan the curiosity of the public people came from far and near to be presentfriends of mr carlyle friends of the hares friends of the challoner family friends of the prisoner besides the general public colonel bethel and mr justice hare had conspicuous seats at a few minutes past nine the judge took his place on the bench but not before a rumor had gone through the courta rumor that seemed to shake it to its centre and which people stretched out their necks to hearotway bethel had turned queens evidence and was to be admitted as a witness for the crown thin haggard pale looked francis levison as he was placed in the dock his incarceration had not in any way contributed to his personal advantages and there was an everrecurring expression of dread upon his countenance not pleasant to look upon he was dressed in black old mrs levison having died and his diamond ring shone conspicuous still on his white hand now whiter than ever the most eminent counsel were engaged on both sides the testimony of the witnesses already given need not be recapitulated the identification of the prisoner with the man thorn was fully establishedebenezer james proved that afy proved it and also that he thorn was at the cottage that night sir peter levisons groom was likewise reexamined but still there wanted other testimony afy was made to reassert that thorn had to go to the cottage for his hat after leaving her but that proved nothing and the conversation or quarrel overheard by mr dill was now again put forward if this was all the evidence people opined that the case for the prosecution would break down call richard hare said the counsel for the prosecution those present who knew mr justice hare looked up at him wondering why he did not stir in answer to his namewondering at the pallid hue which overspread his face not he but another came forwarda fair placid gentlemanly young man with blue eyes fair hair and a pleasant countenance it was richard hare the younger he had assumed his original position in life so far as attire went and in that at least was a gentleman again in speech alsowith his working dress richard had thrown off his working manners a strange hubbub arose in court richard hare the exilethe reported deadthe man whose life was in jeopardy the spectators rose with one accord to get a better view they stood on tiptoe they pushed forth their necks they strained their eyesight and amidst all the noisy hum the groan bursting from the lips of justice hare was unnoticed whilst order was being called for and the judge threatened to clear the court two officers moved themselves quietly up and stood behind the witness richard hare was in custody though he might know it not the witness was sworn what is your name richard hare son of mr justice hare i believe of the grove west lynne his only son the same against whom a verdict of wilful murder is out interposed the judge the same my lord replied richard hare who appeared strange as it may seem to have cast away all his old fearfulness then witness let me warn you that you are not obliged to answer any question that may tend to criminate yourself my lord answered richard hare with some emotion i wish to answer any and every question put to me i have but one hope that the full truth of all pertaining to that fatal evening may be made manifest this day look round at the prisoner said the examining counsel do you know him i know him now as sir francis levison up to april last i believed his name to be thorn state what occurred on the evening of the murder as far as your knowledge goes i had an appointment that evening with afy hallijohn and went down to their cottage to keep it a moment interrupted the counsel was your visit that evening made in secret partially so my father and mother were displeased naturally at my intimacy with afy hallijohn therefore i did not care that they should be cognizant of my visits there i am ashamed to confess that i told my father a lie over it that very evening he saw me leave the dinnertable to go out with my gun and inquired where i was off to i answered that i was going out with young beauchamp when in point of fact you were not no i took my gun for i had promised to lend it to hallijohn while his own was being repaired when i reached the cottage afy refused to admit me she was busy and could not she said i felt sure she had got thorn with her she had more than once before refused to admit me when i had gone there by her own appointment and i always found that thorns presence in the cottage was the obstacle i suppose you and thorn were jealous of each other i was jealous of him i freely admit it i dont know whether he was of me may i inquire what was the nature of your friendship for miss afy hallijohn i loved her with an honorable love as i might have done by any young lady in my own station of life i would not have married her in opposition to my father and mother but i told afy that if she was content to wait for me until i was my own master i would then make her my wife you had no views toward her of a different nature none i cared for her too much for that and i respected her father afys mother had been a lady too although she had married hallijohn who was but clerk to mr carlyle no i never had a thought of wrong toward afyi never could have had now relate the occurrences of the evening afy would not admit me and we had a few words over it but at length i went away first giving her the gun and telling her it was loaded she lodged it against the wall just inside the door and i went into the wood and waited determined to see whether or not thorn was with her for she had denied that he was locksley saw me there and asked why i was hiding i did not answer but i went further off quite out of view of the cottage some time afterward less than half an hour i heard a shot in the direction of the cottage somebody was having a late pop at the partridge i thought just then i saw otway bethel emerge from the trees not far from me and run toward the cottage my lord added richard hare looking at the judge that was the shot that killed hallijohn could the shot asked the counsel have been fired by otway bethel it could not it was much further off bethel disappeared and in another minute there came some one flying down the path leading from the cottage it was thorn and evidently in a state of intense terror his face was livid his eyes staring and he panted and shook like one in the ague past me he tore on down the path and i afterwards heard the sound of his horse galloping away it had been tied in the wood did you follow him no i wondered what had happened to put him in that state but i made haste to the cottage intending to reproach afy with her duplicity i leaped up the two steps and fell over the prostrate body of hallijohn he was lying dead within the door my gun just discharged was flung on the floor its contents in hallijohns side you might have heard a pin drop in court so intense was the interest there appeared to be no one in the cottage upstairs or down i called to afy but she did not answer i caught up the gun and was running from the cottage when locksley came out of the wood and looked at me i grew confused fearful and i threw the gun back again and made off what were your motives for acting in that way a panic had come over me and in that moment i must have lost the use of my reason otherwise i never should have acted as i did thoughts especially of fear pass through our minds with astonishing swiftness and i feared lest the crime should be fastened upon me it was fear made me snatch up my gun lest it should be found near the body it was fear made me throw it back again when locksley appeared in viewa fear you understand from which all judgment all reason had departed but for my own conduct the charge never would have been laid to me go on in my flight i came upon bethel i knew that if he had gone toward the cottage after the shot was fired he must have encountered thorn flying from it he denied that he had he said he had only gone along the path for a few paces and had then plunged into the wood again i believed him and departed departed from west lynne that night i did it was a foolish fatal step the result of cowardice i found the charge was laid to me and i thought i would absent myself for a day or two to see how things turned out next came the inquest and the verdict against me and i then left for good this is the truth so far as you are cognizant of it i swear that it is truth and the whole truth so far as i am cognizant of it replied richard hare with emotion i could not assert it more solemnly were i before god he was subjected to a rigid crossexamination but his testimony was not shaken in the least perhaps not one present but was impressed with its truth afy hallijohn was recalled and questioned as to richards presence at her fathers house that night it tallied with the account given by richard but it had to be drawn from her why did you decline to receive richard hare into the cottage after appointing him to come because i chose returned afy tell the jury why you chose well i had got a friend with meit was captain thorn she added feeling that she should only be questioned on this point so might as well acknowledge it i did not admit richard hare for i fancied they might get up a quarrel if they were together for what purpose did richard hare bring down his gundo you know it was to lend to my father my fathers gun had something the matter with it and was at the smiths i had heard him the previous day ask mr richard to lend him one of his and mr richard said he would bring one as he did you lodged the gun against the wallsafely quite safely was it touched by you after placing it there or by the prisoner i did not touch it </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> it neither did he that i saw it was that same gun which was afterward found near my father and had been discharged the next witness called was otway bethel he also held share in the curiosity of the public but not in equal degree with afy still less with richard hare the substance of his testimony was as follows on the evening that hallijohn was killed i was in the abbey wood and i saw richard hare come down the path with a gun as if he had come down from his own home did richard hare see you no he could not see me i was right in the thicket he went to the cottage door and was about to enter when afy hallijohn came hastily out of it pulling the door to behind her and holding it in her hand as if afraid he would go in some colloquy ensued but i was too far off to hear it and then she took the gun from him and went indoors some time after that i saw richard hare amid the trees at a distance farther off the cottage then than i was and apparently watching the path i was wondering what he was up to hiding there when i head a shot fired close as it seemed to the cottage and stop a bit witness could that shot have been fired by richard hare it could not he was a quarter of a mile nearly away from it i was much nearer the cottage than he go on i could not imagine what that shot meant or who could have fired itnot that i suspected mischiefand i knew that poachers did not congregate so near hallijohns cottage i set off to reconnoiter and as i turned the corner which brought the house within my view i saw captain thorn as he was called come leaping out of it his face was white with terror his breath was gonein short i never saw any living man betray so much agitation i caught his arm as he would have passed me what have you been about i asked was it you that fired he stay why did you suspect him from his state of excitementfrom the terror he was inthat some ill had happened i felt sure and so would you had you seen him as i did my arresting him increased his agitation he tried to throw me off but i am a strong man and i suppose he thought it best to temporize keep dark upon it bethel he said i will make it worth your while the thing was not premeditated it was done in the heat of passion what business had the fellow to abuse me i have done no harm to the girl as he thus spoke he took out a pocket book with the hand that was at liberty i held the other as the prisoner thus spoke you mean the prisoner he took a banknote from his pocket book and thrust it into my hands it was a note for fifty pounds whats done cant be undone bethel he said and your saying that you saw me here can serve no good turn shall it be silence i took the note and answered that it should be silence i had not the least idea that anybody was killed what did you suppose had happened then i could not suppose i could not think it all passed in the haste and confusion of a moment and no definite idea occurred to me thorn flew on down the path and i stood looking after him the next was i heard footsteps and i slipped within the trees they were those of richard hare who took the path to the cottage presently he returned little less agitated than thorn had been i had gone into an open space then and he accosted me asking if i had seen that hound fly from the cottage what hound i asked of him that fine fellow that thorn who comes after afy he answered but i stoutly denied that i had seen any one richard hare continued his way and i afterward found that hallijohn was killed and so you took a bribe to conceal one of the foulest crimes that man ever committed mr otway bethel i took the money and i am ashamed to confess it but it was done without reflection i swear that had i known what crime it was intended to hush up i never would have touched it i was hard up for funds and the amount tempted me when i discovered what had really happened and that richard hare was accused i was thunderstruck at my own deed many a hundred times since have i cursed the money and the fate of richard has been as a heavy weight upon my conscience you might have lifted the weight by confessing to what end it was too late thorn had disappeared i never heard of him or saw him until he came to west lynne this last spring as sir francis levison to oppose mr carlyle richard hare had also disappearedhad never been seen or heard of and most people supposed he was dead to what end then should i confess perhaps only to be suspected myself besides i had taken the money upon a certain understanding and it was only fair that i should keep to it if richard hare was subjected to a severe crossexamination a far more severe one was awaiting otway bethel the judge spoke to him only once his tone ringing with reproach it appears then witness that you have retained within you all these years the proofs of richard hares innocence i can only acknowledge it with contrition my lord what did you know of thorn in those days asked the counsel nothing save that he frequented the abbey wood his object being afy hallijohn i had never exchanged a word with him until that night but i knew his name thornat least the one he went by and by his addressing me as bethel it appeared that he knew mine the case for the prosecution closed an able and ingenious speech was made for the defence the learned counsel who offered it contending that there was still no proof of sir francis having been the guilty man neither was there any proof that the catastrophe was not the result of pure accident a loaded gun standing against a wall in a small room was not a safe weapon and he called upon the jury not rashly to convict in the uncertainty but to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt he should call no witnesses he observed not even to character character for sir francis levison the court burst into a grin the only sober face in it being that of the judge the judge summed up certainly not in the prisoners favor but to use the expression of some amidst the audience dead against him otway bethel came in for a side shaft or two from his lordship richard hare for sympathy the jury retired about four oclock and the judge quitted the bench a very short time they were absent scarcely a quarter of an hour his lordship returned into court and the prisoner was again placed in the dock he was the hue of marble and in his nervous agitation kept incessantly throwing back his hair from his foreheadthe action already spoken of silence was proclaimed how say you gentlemen of the jury guilty or not guilty guilty it was a silence to be felt and the prisoner gasped once or twice convulsively but said the foreman we wish to recommend him to mercy on what grounds inquired the judge because my lord we believe it was not a crime planned by the prisoner beforehand but arose out of the bad passions of the moment and was so committed the judge paused and drew something black from the receptacle of his pocket buried deep in his robes prisoner at the bar have you anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon you the prisoner clutched the front of the dock he threw up his head as if shaking off the dread fear which had oppressed him and the marble of his face changed to scarlet only this my lord the jury in giving their reason for recommending me to your lordships mercy have adopted the right view of the case as it actually occurred the man hallijohns life was taken by me it will be useless for me to deny in the face of the evidence given this day but it was not taken in malice when i quitted the girl afy and went to the cottage for my hat i no more contemplated injuring mortal man than i contemplate it at this moment he was there the father and in the dispute that ensued the catastrophe occurred my lord it was not wilful murder the prisoner ceased and the judge the black cap on his head crossed his hands one upon the other prisoner at the bar you have been convicted by clear and undoubted evidence of the crime of wilful murder the jury have pronounced you guilty and in their verdict i entirely coincide that you took the life of that illfated and unoffending man there is no doubt you have yourself confessed it it was a foul a barbarous a wicked act i care not for what may have been the particular circumstances attending it he may have provoked you by words but no provocation of that nature could justify your drawing the gun upon him your counsel urged that you were a gentleman a member of the british aristocracy and therefore deserved consideration i confess that i was much surprised to hear such a doctrine fall from his lips in my opinion you being what you are your position in life makes your crime the worse and i have always maintained that when a man possessed of advantages falls into sin he deserves less consideration than does one who is poor simple and uneducated certain portions of the evidence given today and i do not now allude to the actual crime tell very greatly against you and i am sure not one in the court but must have turned from them with abhorrence you were pursuing the daughter of this man with no honorable purposeand in this point your conduct contrasts badly with the avowal of richard hare equally a gentleman with yourself in this pursuit you killed her father and not content with that you still pursued the girland pursued her to ruin basely deceiving her as to the actual facts and laying the crime upon another i cannot trust myself to speak further upon this point nor is it necessary that i should it is not to answer for that that you stand before me uncalled unprepared and by you unpitied you hurried that unfortunate man into eternity and you must now expiate the crime with your own life the jury have recommended you to mercy and the recommendation will be forwarded in due course to the proper quarter but you must be aware how frequently this clause is appended to a verdict and how very rarely it is attended to just cause being wanting i can but enjoin you and i do so most earnestly to pass the little time that probably remains to you on earth in seeking repentance and forgiveness you are best aware yourself what your past life has been the world knows somewhat of it but there is pardon above for the most guilty when it is earnestly sought it now only remains for me to pass the sentence of the law it is that you francis levison be taken back to the place from whence you came and thence to the place of execution and that you be there hanged by the neck until you are dead and may the lord god almighty have mercy on your soul amen the court was cleared the days excitement was over and the next case was inquired for not quite over however yet the excitement and the audience crowded in again for the next </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> next case proved to be the arraignment of richard hare the younger a formal proceeding merely in pursuance of the verdict of the coroners inquest no evidence was offered against him and the judge ordered him to be discharged richard poor illused baited richard was a free man again then ensued the scene of all scenes half at least of those present were residents of or from near west lynne they had known richard hare from infancythey had admired the boy in his pretty childhoodthey had liked him in his unoffending boyhood but they had been none the less ready to cast their harsh stones at him and to thunder down their denunciations when the time came in proportion to their fierceness then was their contrition now richard had been innocent all the while they had been more guilty than he an english mob gentle or simple never gets up its excitement by halves whether its demonstration be of a laudatory or a condemnatory nature the steam is sure to be put on to bursting point with one universal shout with one bound they rallied round richard they congratulated him they overwhelmed him with good wishes they expressed with shame their repentance they said the future would atone for the past had he possessed a hundred hands they would have been shaken off and when richard extracted himself and turned in his pleasant forgiving loving nature to his father the stern old justice forgetting his pride and pomposity burst into tears and sobbed like a child as he murmured something about his also needing forgiveness dear father cried richard his own eyes wet it is forgiven and forgotten already think how happy we shall be again together you and i and my mother the justices hands which had been wound around his son relaxed their hold they were twitching curiously the body also began to twitch and he fell upon the shoulder of colonel bethel in a second stroke of paralysis </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xliii the death chamber by the side of william carlyles dying bed knelt the lady isabel the time was at hand and the boy was quite reconciled to his fate merciful indeed is god to dying children it is astonishing how very readily when the right means are taken they may be brought to look with pleasure rather than fear upon their unknown journey the brilliant hectic type of the disease had gone from his cheeks his features were white and wasted and his eyes large and bright his silky brown hair was pushed off his temples and his little hot hands were thrown outside the bed it wont be very long to wait you know will it madame vine for what darling before they all come papa and mamma and lucy and all of them a jealous feeling shot across her wearied heart was she nothing to him do you not care that i should come to you william yes i hope you will but do you think we shall know everybody in heaven or will it be only our own relations oh child i think there will be no relations as you call it up there we can trust all that to god however it may be william lay looking upward at the sky apparently in thought a dark blue serene sky from which shone the hot july sun his bed had been moved toward the window for he liked to sit in it and look at the landscape the window was open now and the butterflies and bees sported in the summer air i wonder how it will be pondered he aloud there will be the beautiful city its gates of pearl and its shining precious stones and its streets of gold and there will be the clear river and the trees with their fruits and their healing leaves and the lovely flowers and there will be the harps and music and singing and what else will there be everything that is desirable and beautiful william but what we may not anticipate here another pause madame vine will jesus come for me do you think or will he send an angel jesus has promised to come for his own redeemedfor those who love him and wait for him yes yes and then i shall be happy forever it will be so pleasant to be there never to be tired or ill again pleasant ay oh william would that the time were come she was thinking of herselfof her freedomthough the boy knew it not she buried her face in her hands and continued speaking william had to bend his ear to catch the faint whisper and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away madame vine do you think mamma will be there he presently asked i mean mamma that was ay ere long but how shall i know her you see i have nearly forgotten what she was like she leaned over him laying her forehead upon his wasted arm and burst into a flood of impassioned tears you will know her never fear william she has not forgotten you but how can we be sure that she will be there debated william after a pause of thought you knowsinking his voice and speaking with hesitationshe was not quite good she was not good enough to papa or to us sometimes i think suppose she did not grow good and did not ask god to forgive her oh william sobbed the unhappy lady her whole life after she left you was one long scene of repentance of seeking forgiveness her repentance her sorrow was greater than she could bear and and what asked william for there was a pause her heart broke in ityearning after you and your father what makes you think it child i know it william considered then had he been strong enough he would have started up with energy madame vine you could only know that by mammas telling you did you ever see her did you know her abroad lady isabels thoughts were far awayup in the clouds perhaps she reflected not on the possible consequences of her answer or she had never given it yes i knew her abroad oh said the boy why did you never tell us what did she say what was she like she saidsobbing wildlythat she was parted from her children here but she should meet them in heaven and be with them forever william darling all the awful pain and sadness and guilt of this world will be washed out and god will wipe your tears away what was her face like he questioned softly like yours very much like lucys was she pretty a momentary pause yes oh dear i am ill hold me cried out william as his head sank to one side and great drops as large as peas broke forth upon his clammy face it appeared to be one of the temporary faint attacks that overpowered him at times lately and lady isabel rang the bell hastily wilson came in in answer joyce was the usual attendant upon the sick room but mrs carlyle with her infant was passing the day at the grove unconscious of the critical state of william and she had taken joyce with her it was the day following the trial mr justice hare had been brought to west lynne in his second attack and barbara had gone to see him to console her mother and to welcome richard to his home again if one carriage drove that day to the grove with cards and inquiries fifty did not to speak of the foot callers it is all meant by way of attention to you richard said gentle mrs hare smiling through her loving tears at her restored son lucy and archie were dining at miss carlyles and sarah attended little arthur leaving wilson free she came in in answer to madame vines ring is he off in another faint unceremoniously cried she hastening to the bed i think so help to raise him william did not faint no the attack was quite different from those he was subject to instead of losing consciousness and power as was customary he shook as if he had the ague and laid hold both of madame vine and wilson grasping them convulsively dont let me fall dont let me fall he gasped my dear you cannot fall responded madame vine you forget that you are on the bed he clasped them yet and trembled still as from fear dont let me fall dont let me fall the incessant burden of his cry the paroxysm passed they wiped his brow and stood looking at him wilson with a pursed up mouth and a peculiar expression of face she put a spoonful of restorative jelly between his lips and he swallowed it but shook his head when she would have given him another turning his face to the pillow in a few minutes he was in a doze what could it have been exclaimed lady isabel in an undertone to wilson i know was the oracular answer i saw this same sort of an attack once before madame and what caused it twasnt in a child though went on wilsontwas in a grown person but thats nothing it comes for the same thing in all i think he was taken for death who uttered lady isabel startled wilson made no reply in words but she pointed with her finger to the bed oh wilson he is not so ill as that mr wainwright said this morning that he might last a week or two wilson composedly sat herself down in the easiest chair she was not wont to put herself out of the way for the governess and that governess was too much afraid of her in one sense to let her know her place as to wainwright hes nobody quoth she and if he saw the childs breath going out before his face and knew that the next moment would be his last hed vow to us all that he was good for twelve hours to come you dont know wainwright as i do madame he was our doctor at mothers and he has attended in all the places i have lived in since i went out to service five years i was maid at mrs hares i came here when miss lucy was a baby and in all my places has he attended like ones shadow my lady isabel thought great guns of old wainwright i remember it was more than i did my lady isabel made no response to this she took a seat and watched william through her glasses his breathing was more labored than usual that idiot sarah says to me today says she which of his two grandpapas will they bury him by old mr carlyle or lord mount severn dont be a calf i answered her dye think theyll stick him out in the corner with my lordhell be put into the carlyle vault of course it would have been different you see madame vine if my lady had died at home all propermr carlyles wife theyd have buried her no doubt by her father and the boy would have been laid with her but she did not no reply was made by madame vine and a silence ensued nothing to be heard but that fleeting breath i wonder how that beauty feels suddenly broke forth wilson again her tone one of scornful irony lady isabel her eyes and her thoughts absorbed by william positively thought wilsons words must relate to him she turned to her in surprise that bright gem in the prison at lynneborough exclaimed wilson i hope he may have found himself pretty well since yesterday i wonder how many trainfuls from west lynne will go to his hanging isabels face turned crimson her heart sick she had not dared to inquire how the trial terminated the subject altogether was too dreadful and nobody had happened to mention it in her hearing is he condemned she breathed in a low tone he is condemned and good luck to him and mr otway bethels let loose again and good luck </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> luck to him a nice pair they are nobody went from this house to hear the trialit might not have been pleasant you know to mr carlyle but people came in last night and told us all about it young richard hare chiefly convicted him he is back again and so nicelooking they sayten times more so than he was when quite a young man you should have heard they say the cheering and shouts that greeted mr richard when his innocence came out it pretty near rose off the roof of the court and the judge didnt stop it wilson paused but there was no answering comment on she went again when mr carlyle brought the news home last evening and broke it to his wife telling her how mr richard had been received with acclamations she nearly fainted for shes not strong yet mr carlyle called out to me to bring some wateri was in the next room with the babyand there she was the tears raining from her eyes and he holding her to him i always said there was a whole world of love between those two though he did go and marry another mr carlyle ordered me to put the water down and sent me away again but i dont fancy he told her of old hares attack until this morning lady isabel lifted her aching forehead what attack why madame dont you know i declare you box yourself up in the house keeping from everybody and you hear nothing you might as well be living at the bottom of a coalpit old hare had another stroke in the court at lynneborough and thats why my mistress is gone to the grove today who says richard hares come home wilson the questionthe weak scarcely audible questionhad come from the dying boy wilson threw up her hands and made a bound to the bed the like of that she uttered aside to mrs vine one never knows when to take these sick ones master william you hold your tongue and drop to sleep again your papa will be home soon from lynneborough and if you talk and get tired hell say its my fault come shut your eyes will you have a bit more jelly william making no reply to the offer of jelly buried his face again on the pillow but he was grievously restless the nearly wornout spirit was ebbing and flowing mr carlyle was at lynneborough he always had much business there at assize time and the nisi prius court but the previous day he had not gone himself mr dill had been dispatched to represent him between seven and eight he returned home and came into williams chamber the boy brightened up at the wellknown presence papa mr carlyle sat down on the bed and kissed him the passing beams of the sun slanting from the horizon shone into the room and mr carlyle could view well the dying face the gray hue of death was certainly on it is he worse he exclaimed hastily to madame vine who was jacketed and capped and spectacled and tied up round the throat and otherwise disguised in her universal fashion he appears worse this evening sirmore weak papa panted william is the trial over what trial my boy sir francis levisons it was over yesterday never trouble your head about him my brave boy he is not worth it but i want to know will they hang him he is sentenced to it did he kill hallijohn yes who has been talking to him upon the subject mr carlyle continued to madame vine with marked displeasure in his tone wilson mentioned it sir was the low answer oh papa what will he do will jesus forgive him we must hope it do you hope it papa yes i wish that all the world may be forgiven william whatever may have been their sins my child how restless you seem i cant keep in one place the bed gets wrong pull me up on the pillow will you madame vine mr carlyle gently lifted the boy himself madame vine is an untiring nurse to you william he observed gratefully casting a glance toward her in the distance where she had retreated and was shaded by the window curtain william made no reply he seemed to be trying to recall something i forget i forget forget what asked mr carlyle it was something i wanted to ask you or to tell you isnt lucy come home i suppose not papa i want joyce i will send her home to you i am going for your mamma after dinner for mammaoh i remember now papa how shall i know mamma in heaven not this mamma mr carlyle did not immediately reply the question may have puzzled him william continued hastily possibly mistaking the motive of the silence she will be in heaven you know yes yes child speaking hurriedly madame vine knows she will she saw her abroad and mamma told her thatwhat was it madame madame vine grew sick with alarm mr carlyle turned his eyes upon her scarlet faceas much as he could get to see of it she would have escaped from the room if she could mamma was more sorry than she could bear went on william finding he was not helped she wanted you papa and she wanted us and her heart broke and she died a flush rose to mr carlyles brow he turned inquiringly to madame vine oh i beg your pardon sir she murmured with desperate energy i ought not to have spoken i ought not to have interfered in your family affairs i spoke only as i thought it must be sir the boy seemed troubled about his mother mr carlyle was at sea did you meet his mother abroad i scarcely understand she lifted her hand and covered her glowing face no sir surely the recording angel blotted out the words if ever a prayer for forgiveness went up from an aching heart it must have gone up then for the equivocation over her childs deathbed mr carlyle went toward her do you perceive the change in his countenance he whispered yes sir he has looked like this since a strange fit of trembling that came on in the afternoon wilson thought he might be taken for death i fear that some four and twenty hours will end it mr carlyle rested his elbow on the window frame and his hand upon his brow his drooping eyelids falling over his eyes it is hard to lose him oh sir he will be better off she wailed choking down the sobs and the emotion that arose threateningly we can bear death it is not the worst parting that the earth knows he will be quit of this cruel world sheltered in heaven i wish we were all there a servant came to say that mr carlyles dinner was served and he proceeded to it with what appetite he had when he returned to the sick room the daylight had faded and a solitary candle was placed where its rays could not fall upon the childs face mr carlyle took the light in his hand to scan that face again he was lying sideways on the pillow his hollow breath echoing through the room the light caused him to open his eyes dont papa please i like it dark only for a moment my precious boy and not for more than a moment did mr carlyle hold it the blue pinched ghastly look was there yet death was certainly coming on quick at that moment lucy and archibald came in on their return from their visit to miss carlyle the dying boy looked up eagerly goodbye lucy he said putting out his cold damp hand i am not going out replied lucy we have but just come home goodbye lucy repeated he she laid hold of the little hand then leaned over and kissed him goodbye william but indeed i am not going out anywhere i am said he i am going to heaven wheres archie mr carlyle lifted archie on to the bed lucy looked frightened archie surprised archie goodbye goodbye dear i am going to heaven to that bright blue sky you know i shall see mamma there and ill tell her that you and lucy are coming soon lucy a sensitive child broke into a loud storm of sobs enough to disturb the equanimity of any sober sick room wilson hastened in at the sound and mr carlyle sent the two children away with soothing promises that they should see william in the morning if he continued well enough down on her knees her face buried in the counterpane a corner of it stuffed into her mouth that it might help to stifle her agony knelt lady isabel the moments excitement was well nigh beyond her strength of endurance her own childhis childthey alone around its deathbed and she might not ask or receive a word of comfort of consolation mr carlyle glanced at her as he caught her choking sobs just as he would have glanced at any other attentive governessfeeling her sympathy doubtless but nothing more she was not heart and part with him and his departing boy lower and lower bent he over that boy for his eyes were wet dont cry papa whispered william raising his feeble hand caressingly to his fathers cheek i am not afraid to go jesus is coming for me afraid to go indeed i hope not my gentle boy you are going to godto happiness a few yearswe know not how fewand we shall all come to you yes you will be sure to come i know that i shall tell mamma so i dare say she is looking out for me now perhaps shes standing on the banks of the river watching the boats he had evidently got that picture of martins in his mind the plains of heaven mr carlyle turned to the table he saw some strawberry juice pressed from the fresh fruit and moistened with it the boys fevered lips papa i cant think how jesus can be in all the boats perhaps they dont go quite at the same time he must be you know because he comes to fetch us he will be yours darling was the whispered fervent answer oh yes he will take me all the way up to god and say heres a poor little boy come you must please to forgive him and let him go into heaven because i died for him papa did you know that mammas heart broke william i think it likely that your poor mammas heart did break ere death came but let us talk of you not of her are you in pain i cant breathe i cant swallow i wish joyce was here she will not be long now the boy nestled himself in his fathers arms and in a few minutes appeared to be asleep mr carlyle after a while gently laid him on his pillow and watched him and then turned to depart oh papa papa he cried out in a tone of painful entreaty opening wide his yearning eyes say goodbye to me mr carlyles tears fell upon the little upturned face as he once more caught it to his breast my darling your papa will soon be back he is going to bring mamma to see you and pretty little baby anna and baby anna if you would like her to come in i will not leave my darling boy for long he need not fear i shall not leave you again tonight william when once i am back then put me down and go papa a lingering embracea fond lingering tearful embracemr carlyle holding him to his beating heart then he laid him comfortably on his pillow gave him a teaspoonful of strawberry juice and hastened away goodbye papa came forth the little feeble cry it was not heard mr carlyle was gone gone from his living childforever up rose lady isabel and flung her arms aloft in a storm of sobs oh william darling in this dying moment let me be to you as your mother again he unclosed his </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> his wearied eyelids it is probable that he only partially understood papas gone for her not her ii lady isabel checked herself and fell sobbing on the bed no not even at the last hour when the world was closing on him dared she say i am your mother wilson reentered he looks as if he were dropping off to sleep quoth she yes said lady isabel you need not wait wilson i will ring if he requires anything wilson though withal not a badhearted woman was not one to remain for pleasure in a sickroom if told she might leave it she lady isabel remained alone she fell on her knees again this time in prayer for the departing spirit on its wing and that god would mercifully vouchsafe herself a restingplace with it in heaven a review of the past then rose up before her from the time of her first entering that house the bride of mr carlyle to her present sojourn in it the old scenes passed through her mind like the changing picture in a phantasmagoria why should they have come there and then she knew not william slept on silently she thought of the past the dreadful reflection if i had not done as i did how different would it have been now had been sounding its knell in her heart so often that she had almost ceased to shudder at it the very nails of her hands had before now entered the palms with the sharp pain it brought stealing over her more especially this night there as she knelt her head lying on the counterpane came the recollection of that first illness of hers how she had lain and in that unfounded jealousy imagined barbara the houses mistress she dead barbara exalted to her place mr carlyles wife her childs stepmother she recalled the day when her mind excited by a certain gossip of wilsonsit was previously in a state of fever bordering on deliriumshe had prayed her husband in terror and anguish not to marry barbara how could he marry her he had replied in his soothing pity she isabel was his wife who was barbara nothing to them but it had all come to pass she had brought it forth not mr carlyle not barbara she alone oh the dreadful misery of the retrospect lost in thought in anguish past and present in selfcondemning repentance the time passed on nearly an hour must have elapsed since mr carlyles departure and william had not disturbed her but who was this coming into the room joyce she hastily rose up as joyce advancing with a quiet step drew aside the clothes to look at william master says he has been wanting me she observed whyoh it was a sharp momentary cry subdued as soon as uttered madame vine sprang forward to joyces side looking also the pale young face lay calm in its utter stillness the busy little heart had ceased to beat jesus christ had indeed come and taken the fleeting spirit then she lost all selfcontrol she believed that she had reconciled herself to the childs death that she could part with him without too great emotion but she had not anticipated it would be quite so soon she had deemed that some hours more would at least be given him and now the storm overwhelmed her crying sobbing calling she flung herself upon him she clasped him to her she dashed off her disguising glasses she laid her face upon his beseeching him to come back to her that she might say farewellto her his mother her darling child her lost william joyce was terrifiedterrified for consequences with her full strength she pulled her from the boy praying her to considerto be still do not do not for the love of heaven my lady my lady it was the old familiar title that struck upon her fears and induced calmness she stared at joyce and retreated backward after the manner of one receding from some hideous vision then as recollection came to her she snatched her glasses up and hurried them on my lady let me take you into your room mr carlyle is come he is just bringing up his wife only think if you should give way before him pray come away how did you know me she asked in a hollow voice my lady it was that night when there was an alarm of fire i went close up to you to take master archibald from your arms and as sure as i am now standing here i believe that for the moment my senses left me i thought i saw a spectrethe spectre of my dead lady i forgot the present i forgot that all were standing round me that you madame vine were alive before me your face was not disguised then the moonlight shone full upon it and i knew it after the first few moments of terror to be in dreadful truth the living one of lady isabel my lady come away we shall have mr carlyle here poor thing she sank upon her knees in her humility her dread oh joyce have pity upon me dont betray me i will leave the house indeed i will dont betray me while i am in it my lady you have nothing to fear from me i have kept the secret buried within my breast since then last april it has nearly been too much for me by night and by day i have had no peace dreading what might come out think of the awful confusion the consequences should it come to the knowledge of mr and mrs carlyle indeed my lady you never ought to have come joyce she said hollowly lifting her haggard face i could not keep away from my unhappy children is it no punishment to me think you the being here she added vehemently to see himmy husbandthe husband of another it is killing me oh my lady come away i hear him i hear him partly coaxing partly dragging her joyce took her into her own room and left her there mr carlyle was at that moment at the door of the sick one joyce sprang forward her face in her emotion and fear was of one livid whiteness and she shook as william had shaken poor child in the afternoon it was only too apparent in the welllighted corridor joyce he exclaimed in amazement what ails you sir master she panted be prepared master williammaster william joyce not dead alas yes sir mr carlyle strode into the chamber but ere he was well across it he turned back to slip the bolt of the door on the pillow lay the white thin face at rest now my boy my boy oh my god he murmured in bowed reverence mayest thou have received this child to rest in jesus even as i trust thou hadst already received his unhappy mother </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xliv lord vane dating forward to the burial of william carlyle came lord mount severn and his son wilson had been right in her surmises as to the restingplace the carlyle vault was opened for him and an order went forth to the sculptor for an inscription to be added to their marble tablet in the church william vane carlyle eldest son of archibald carlyle of east lynne amongst those who attended the funeral as mourners went one more notable in the eyes of the gazers than the restrichard hare the younger lady isabel was ill ill in mind and ominously ill in body she kept her room and joyce attended on her the household set down madames illness to the fatigue of having attended upon master william it was not thought of seriously by any one especially as she declined to see a doctor all her thoughts now were directed to the getting away from east lynne for it would never do to remain there to die and she knew that death was on his way to her and that no human power or skillnot all the faculty combinedcould turn him back again the excessive dread of detection was not upon her as it had been formerly i mean she did not dread the consequences so much if detection came in nearing the grave all fears and hopes of whatever nature relating to this world lose their force and fears or hopes regarding the next world take their place our petty feelings here are lost in the greater in returning to east lynne lady isabel had entered upon a daring act and she found in the working that neither strength nor spirit was equal to it human passions and tempers were brought with us into this world and they can only quit us when we bid it farewell to enter upon immortality in the next when lady isabel was mr carlyles wife she had never wholly loved him the very utmost homage that esteem admiration affection could give was his but that mysterious passion called by the name of love and which as i truly and heartily believe cannot in its refined etherealism be known to many of us had not been given to him it was now from the very night she came back to east lynne her love for mr carlyle had burst forth with an intensity never before felt it had been smoldering almost ever since she quitted him reprehensible groans a moralist very everybody knows that as afy would say but her heart you see had not done with human passions and they work ill and contrariness let the word stand critic if you please and precisely everything they should not i shall get in for it i fear if i attempt to defend her but it was not exactly the same thing as though she suffered herself to fall in love with somebody elses husband nobody would defend that we have not turned mormons yet and the world does not walk upon its head but this was a peculiar case she poor thing almost regarded mr carlyle as her husband the bent of her thoughts was only too much inclined to this the evil human heart again many and many a time did she wake up from a reverie and strive to drive this mistaken view of things away from her taking shame to herself ten minutes afterward she would catch her brain reveling in the same rebellious vision mr carlyles love was not hers now it was barbaras mr carlyle did not belong to her he belonged to his wife it was not only that he was not hershe was anothers you may therefore if you have the pleasure of being experienced in this sort of thing guess a little of what her inward life was had there been no barbara in the case she might have lived and borne it as it was it had killed her before her time that and the remorse together there had been other things too the reappearance of francis levison at west lynne in fresh contact as may be said with herself had struck terror to her heart and the dark charge brought against him augmented awfully her remorse then the sharp lances perpetually thrust upon her memorythe lady isabels memoryfrom all sides were full of cruel stings unintentionally though they were hurled and there was the hourly chance of discovery and the never ceasing battle with her conscience for being at east lynne at all no wonder that the chords of life were snapping the wonder would have been had they remained whole she brought it upon herselfshe ought not to have come back to east lynne groans our moralist again didnt i say so of course she ought not neither ought she to have suffered her thoughts to stray in the manner they did towards mr carlyle she ought not but she did if we all did just what we ought this lower proverb touching fruit defendu would go out as a dead letter she was nearer to death than she imagined she knew judging by her declining strength and her inner feelings that it could not be far off but she did not deem it was coming so very soon her mother had died in </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> in a similar way some said of consumptiondr martin did you may remember some said of waste the earl her husband said a broken heartyou heard him say so to mr carlyle in the first chapter of this history the earl was the one who might be supposed to know best whatever may have been lady mount severns malady sheto give you the phrase that was in peoples mouths at the timewent out like the snuff of a candle it was now the turn of lady isabel she had no more decided disorder than the countess had had yet death had marked her she felt that it had and in its approach she dreaded not as she once had done the consequences that must ensue did discovery come which brings us back to the point whence ensued this long digression i dare say you are chafing at it but it is not often i trouble you with one but she would not willingly let discovery come neither had she the least intention of remaining at east lynne to die where she should take refuge was quite a secondary consideration only let her get smoothly and plausibly away joyce in her dread was forever urging it of course the preliminary step was to arrange matters with mrs carlyle and in the afternoon of the day following the funeral lady isabel proceeded to her dressingroom and craved an interview mr carlyle quitted the room as she entered it barbara fatigued with a recent drive was lying on the sofa she would scarcely take the notice we shall be so sorry to lose you madame vine you are all we could wish for lucy and mr carlyle feels truly grateful for your love and attention to his poor boy to leave you will give me pain also madame vine answered in a subdued tone pain ay mrs carlyle little guessed at its extent all she cared for on earth she should leave behind her at east lynne indeed you must not leave resumed barbara it would be unjust to allow you to do so you have made yourself ill waiting upon poor william and you must stay here and take a holiday until you are cured you will soon get well if you will only suffer yourself to be properly waited on and taken care of you are very considerate pray do not think me insensible if i decline i believe my strength is beyond getting upthat i shall never be able to teach again oh nonsense said barbara in her quick way we are all given to fancy the worst when we are ill i was feeling terribly weak only a few minutes ago and said something of the same sort to archibald he talked and soothed me out of it i wish you had your dear husband living madame vine to support you and love you as i have him a tinge of scarlet streaked madame vines pale face and she laid her hand upon her beating heart how could you think of leaving we should be glad to help reestablish your health in any case but it is only fair to do it now i felt sure by the news brought to me when i was ill that your attention upon william was overtasking your strength it is not the attendance upon william that has brought me into this state was the quick answer i must leave i have well considered it over would you like to go to the seaside exclaimed barbara with sudden energy i am going there on monday next mr carlyle insists upon it that i try a little change i had intended only to take my baby but we can make different arrangements and take you and lucy it might do you good madame vine she shook her head no it would make me worse all that i want is perfect quiet i must beg you to understand that i shall leave and i should be glad if you could allow the customary notice to be dispensed with so that i may be at liberty to depart within a few days look here then said barbara after a pause of consideration you remain at east lynne until my return which will be in a fortnight mr carlyle cannot stay with me so i know i shall be tired in less time than that i do not want you to remain to teach you know madame vine i do not wish you to do a single thing lucy shall have a holiday and mr kane can come up for her music only i could not be content to leave her unless under your surveillance she is getting of an age now not to be consigned to servants not to joyce upon my return if you still wish to leave you shall then be at liberty to do so what do you say madame vine said yes said it eagerly to have another fortnight with her children lucy and archibald was very like a reprieve and she embraced it although she knew as i have said that grim death was on his way she did not think he had drawn so near the end of his journey her thoughts went back to the time when she had been ordered to the seaside after an illness it had been a marvel if they had not she remembered how he her husband had urged the change upon her how he had taken her traveling carefully how tenderly anxious he had been in the arrangements for her comfort when settling her in the lodgings how when he came again to see her he had met her with his passionate fondness thanking god for the visible improvement in her looks that one injunction which she had called him back to give him as he was departing for the boat was bitterly present to her now do not get making love to barbara hare all this care and love and tenderness belonged now of right to barbara and were given to her but now barbara although she pressed madame vine to remain at east lynne and indeed would have been glad that she should do so did not take her refusal at heart barbara could not fail to perceive that she was a thoroughly refined gentlewoman far superior to the generality of governesses that she was truly fond of lucy and most anxious for her welfare in every way barbara also saw for lucys sake therefore she would be grieved to part with madame vine and would raise her salary to anything in reason if she would but stay but on her own score barbara had as soon madame vine went as not for in her heart of hearts she had never liked her she could not have told why was it instinct very probably the birds of the air the beasts of the field the fishes of the sea have their instincts and so does man have his perhaps it was the unaccountable resemblance that madame vine bore to lady isabel a strange likeness barbara often thought but whether it lay in the face the voice or the manner she could not decide a suspicion of the truth did not cross her mind how should it and she never spoke of it had the resemblance been to any one but lady isabel she would have talked of it freely or it may have been that there was now and then a tone in madame vines voice that grated on her ear a wrung impatient tone wanting in respect savoring of hauteur which barbara did not understand and did not like however it may have been certain it is that mrs carlyle would not shed tears after the governess only for lucys sake did she regret parting with her these different resemblances and reflections were separately passing through the minds of the two ladies when their conference was over madame vine at length rose from her chair to depart would you mind holding my baby for one minute cried barbara madame vine quite started the baby there she uttered barbara laughed it is lying by my side under the shawl quiet little sleeping thing madame vine advanced and took the sleeping baby how could she refuse she had never had it in her arms before she had in fact scarcely seen it one visit of ceremony she had paid mrs carlyle as in politeness bound a day or two after the young ladys arrival and had been shown a little face nearly covered with lace in a cradle thank you i can get up now i might have half smothered it had i attempted before continued barbara still laughing i have been here long enough and am quite rested talking about smothering children what accounts have we in the registrargenerals weekly returns of health so many children overlaid in bed so many children suffocated in bed one week there were nearly twenty and often there are as many as eight or ten mr carlyle says he knows they are smothered on purpose oh mrs carlyle i exclaimed just as you do when he said it and laid my hand over his lips he laughed and told me i did not know half the wickedness of the world thank you again repeated mrs carlyle taking her child from lady isabel is she not a pretty baby do you like the nameanne it is a simple name replied lady isabel and simple names are always the most attractive that is just what archibald thinks but he wanted this childs to be barbara i would not have had it barbara for the world i remember his once saying a long long while ago that he did not like elaborate names they were mouthfuls and he instanced mine and his sisters and his own i recalled his words to him and he said he may not have liked the name of barbara then but he loved it now so we entered into a compromise miss baby was named anne barbara with an understanding that the first name is to be for use and the last for the registers it is not christened said lady isabel only baptized we should have had it christened before now but for williams death not that we give christening dinners but i waited for the trial at lynneborough to be over that my dear brother richard might stand to the child mr carlyle does not like christenings made into festivals lady isabel dreamily observed her thoughts buried in the past how do you know that exclaimed barbara opening her eyes and poor madame vine her pale face flushing had to stammer forth some confused words that she had heard so somewhere it is quite true said barbara he has never given a christeningdinner for any of his children and gets out of attending if invited to one he cannot understand the analogy between a solemn religious rite and the meeting together afterward to eat and drink and make merry according to the fashion of this world as lady isabel quitted the room young vane was careering through the corridor throwing his head in all directions and calling out lucy i want lucy what do you want with her asked madame vine il mest impossible de vous le dire madame responded he being for an eton boy wonderfully up in french he was rather given to show it off when he got the chance he did not owe thanks for it to eton lady mount severn had taken better care than that better care what could she want there was one whole real live french tutorand he an englishmanfor the eight hundred boys very unreasonable of her ladyship to disparage that ample provision lucy cannot come to you just now she is practicing mais il le faut jai le droit de demander apres elle elle mappartient vous comprenez madame cette demoiselle la madame could not forbear a smile i wish you would speak english sense instead of french nonsense then the english sense is that i want lucy and i must have her i am going to take her for a drive in the pony carriage if you must know she said shed come and johns getting it </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> it ready i could not possibly allow it said madame vine youd be sure to upset her the idea he returned indignantly as if i should upset lucy why im one of the great whips at eton i care for lucy too much not to drive steadily she is to be my wife you know ma bonne dame at this juncture two heads were pushed out from the library close by those of the earl and mr carlyle barbara also attracted by the talking appeared at the door of her dressingroom whats that about a wife asked my lord of his son the blood mantled in the young gentlemans cheek as he turned round and saw who had spoken but he possessed all the fearlessness of an eton boy i intend lucy carlyle to be my wife papa i mean in earnestwhen we shall both be grown upif you will approve and mr carlyle will give her to me the earl looked somewhat impassable mr carlyle amused suppose said the latter we adjourn the discussion to this day ten years but that lucy is so very young a child i should reprove you seriously sir said the earl you have no right to bring lucys name into any such absurdity i mean it papa youll all see and i intend to keep out of scrapesthat is of nasty dishonorable scrapeson purpose that mr carlyle shall find no excuse against me i have made up my mind to be what he isa man of honor i am right glad you know about it sir and i shall let mamma know it before long the last sentence tickled the earls fancy and a grim smile passed over his lips it will be war to the knife if you do i know that laughed the viscount but i am getting a better match for mamma in our battles than i used to be nobody saw fit to prolong the discussion barbara put her veto upon the drive in the pony carriage unless john sat behind to look after the driver which lord vane still resented as an insult madame vine when the corridor became empty again laid her hand upon the boys arm as he was moving away and drew him to the window in speaking as you do of lucy carlyle do you forget the disgrace reflected on her by the conduct of her mother her mother is not lucy it may prove an impediment that with lord and lady mount severn not with his lordship and i must doas you heard me saybattle with my mother conciliatory battle you understand madame bringing the enemy to reason madame vine was agitated she held her handkerchief to her mouth and the boy noticed how her hands trembled i have learnt to love lucy it has appeared to me in these few months sojourn with her that i have stood to her in light of a mother william vane she solemnly added keeping her hold upon him i shall soon be where earthly distinctions are no more where sin and sorrow are no more should lucy carlyle indeed become your wife in after years never never cast upon her by so much as the slightest word of reproach the sin of lady isabel lord vane threw back his head his honest eyes flashing in their indignant earnestness what do you take me for it would be a cruel wrong upon lucy she does not deserve it that unhappy ladys sin was all her own let it die with her never speak to lucy of her mother the lad dashed his hand across his eyes for they were filling i shall i shall speak to her often of her motherthat is you know after shes my wife i shall tell her how i loved lady isabelthat theres nobody i ever loved so much in the world but lucy herself i cast a reproach to lucy on the score of her mother he hotly added it is through her mother that i love her you dont understand madame cherish and love her forever should she become yours said lady isabel wringing his hand i ask it you as one who is dying i willi promise it but i say madame he continued dropping his fervent tone what do you allude to are you worse madame vine did not answer she glided away without speaking later when she was sitting by twilight in the gray parlor cold and shivering and wrapped up in a shawl though it was hot summer weather somebody knocked at the door come in cried she apathetically it was mr carlyle who entered she rose up her pulses quickening her heart thumping against her side in her wild confusion she was drawing forward a chair for him he laid his hand upon it and motioned her to her own mrs carlyle tells me that you have been speaking to her of leavingthat you find yourself too much out of health to continue with us yes sir she faintly replied having a most imperfect notion of what she did say what is it that you find to be the matter with you ithinkit is chieflyweakness she stammered her face had grown as gray as the walls a dusky livid sort of hue not unlike williams had worn the night of his death and her voice sounded strangely hollow it the voice struck mr carlyle and awoke his fears you cannotyou never can have caught williams complaint in your close attendance upon him he exclaimed speaking in the impulse of the moment as the idea flashed across him i have heard of such things caught it from him she rejoined carried away also by impulse it is more likely that he she stopped herself just in time inherited it from me had been the destined conclusion in her alarm she went off volubly something to the effect that it was no wonder she was ill illness was natural to her family at any rate you have become ill at east lynne in attendance on my children rejoined mr carlyle decisively when her voice died away you must therefore allow me to insist that you allow east lynne to do what it can toward renovating you what is your objection to see a doctor a doctor could do me no good she faintly answered certainly not so long as you will not consult one indeed sir doctors could not cure me nor as i believe prolong my life mr carlyle paused are you believing yourself to be in danger not in immediate danger sir only in so far as that i know i shall not live and yet you will not see a doctor madame vine you must be aware that i could not permit such a thing to go on in my house dangerous illness and no advice she could not say to him my malady is on the mind it is a breaking heart and therefore no doctor of physic could serve me that would never do she had sat with her hand across her face between her spectacles and her wrappedup chin had mr carlyle possessed the eyes of argus backed by sam wellers patent magnifying microscopes of double hextra power he could not have made anything of her features in the broad light of day but she did not feel so sure of it there was always an undefined terror of discovery when in his presence and she wished the interview at an end i will see mr wainwright if it will be any satisfaction to you sir madame vine i have intruded upon you here to say that you must see him and should he deem it necessary dr martin also oh sir she rejoined with a curious smile mr wainwright will be quite sufficient there will be no need of another i will write a note to him tomorrow spare yourself the trouble i am going into west lynne and will send him up you will permit me to urge that you spare no pains or care that you suffer my servants to spare no pains or care to reestablish your health mrs carlyle tells me that the question of your leaving remains in abeyance until her return pardon me sir the understanding with mrs carlyle was that i should remain here until her return and should then be at liberty at once to leave exactly that is what mrs carlyle said but i must express a hope that by that time you may be feeling so much better as to reconsider your decision and continue with us for my daughters sake madame vine i trust it will be so he rose as he spoke and held out his hand what could she do but rise also drop hers from her face and give it him in answer he retained it clasping it warmly how should i repay youhow thank you for your love to my poor lost boy his earnest tender eyes were on her blue double spectacles a sad smile mingled with the sweet expression of his lips as he bent toward herlips that had once been hers a faint exclamation of despair a vivid glow of hot crimson and she caught up her new black silk apron so deeply bordered with crape in her disengaged hand and flung it up to her face he mistook the soundmistook the action do not grieve for him he is at rest thank youthank you greatly for your sympathy another wring of her hand and mr carlyle had quitted the room she laid her head upon the table and thought how merciful would be death when he should come </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlv it wont do afy mr jiffin was in his glory mr jiffins house was the same both were in applepie order to receive miss afy hallijohn who was in a very short period indeed to be converted into mrs jiffin mr jiffin had not seen afy for some dayshad never been able to come across her since the trial at lynneborough every evening had he danced attendance at her lodgings but could not get admitted not at homenot at home was the invariable answer though afy might be sunning herself at the window in his very sight mr jiffin throwing off as best he could the temporary disappointment was in an ecstasy of admiration for he set it all down to afys retiring modesty on the approach of the nuptial day and they could try to calumniate her he indignantly replied but now one afternoon when mr jiffin and his shopman and his shop and his wares were all set out to the best advantageand very tempting they looked as a whole especially the spiced baconmr jiffin happening to cast his eyes to the opposite side of the street beheld his beloved sailing by she was got up in the fashion a mauve silk dress with eighteen flounces and about eighteen hundred steel buttons that glittered your sight away a zouave jacket worked with gold a black turban perched on the top of her skull garnished in front with what court milliners are pleased to term a plume de coq but which by its size and height might have been taken for a coq himself while a white ostrich feather was carried round and did duty behind and a spangled hair net hung down to her waist gloriously grand was afy that day and if i had but a photographing machine at handor whatever may be the scientific name of the thingyou should certainly have been regaled with the sight of her joyce would have gone down in a fit had she encountered her by an unhappy chance mr jiffin dashing his apron anywhere tore across oh it is you said afy freezingly when compelled to acknowledge him but his offered hand she utterly repudiated really mr jiffin i should feel obliged if you would not come out to me in this offensive and public manner mr jiffin grew cold offensive not come out gasped he i do trust i have not been so unfortunate as to offend you miss afy wellyou see said afy calling up all her impudence to say what she had made up her mind to say i have been considering it </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> it well over jiffin and i find that to carry out the marriage will not be for myfor our happiness i intended to write to inform you of this but i shall be spared the troubleas you have come out to me the perspiration cold as ice began to pour off mr jiffin in his agony and horror you might have wrung every thread he had on youdont meantoimplythatyougivemeupmissafy he jerked out unevenly well yes i do replied afy its as good to be plain and then there can be no misapprehension ill shake hands now with you jiffin for the last time and i am very sorry that we both made such a mistake poor jiffin looked at her his gaze would have melted a heart of stone miss afy you cant mean it youd never sure crush a fellow in this manner whose whole soul is yours who trusted you entirely theres not an earthly thing i would not do to please you you have been the light of my existence of course returned afy with a lofty and indifferent air as if to be the light of his existence was only her due but its all done and over it is not at all a settlement that will suit me you see jiffin a butter and bacon factor is so veryso verywhat i have not been accustomed to and then those aprons i never could get reconciled to them ill discard the aprons altogether cried he in a fever ill get a second shopman and buy a little gig and do nothing but drive you out ill do anything if you will but have me still miss afy i have bought the ring you know your intentions are very kind was the distant answer but its a thing impossible my mind is fully made up so farewell for good jiffin and i wish you better luck in your next venture afy lifting her capacious dress for the streets had just been watered minced off and mr joe jiffin wiping his wet face as he gazed after her instantly wished that he could be nailed up in one of his pickled pork barrels and so be out of his misery thats done with thank goodness soliloquized afy have him indeed after what richard let out on the trial as if i should look after anybody less than dick hare i shall get him too i always knew dick hare loved me above everything on earth and he does still or hed never had said what he did in open court its better to be born lucky than rich wont west lynne envy me mrs richard hare of the grove old hare is on his last legs and then dick comes into his own mrs hare must have her jointure house elsewhere for we shall want the grove for ourselves i wonder if madame barbara will condescend to recognize me and that blessed corny i shall be a sort of cousin of cornys then i wonder how much dick comes intothree or four thousand a year and to think that i had nearly escaped this by tying myself to that ape of a jiffin what sharks do get in our unsuspecting paths in this world on went afy through west lynne till she arrived close to mr justice hares then she paced slowly it had been a frequent walk of hers since the trial luck favored her today as she was passing the gate young richard hare came up from the direction of east lynne it was the first time afy had obtained speech of him good day richard why you were never going to pass an old friend i have so many friends said richard i can scarcely spare time for them individually but you might for me have you forgotten old days continued she bridling and flirting and altogether showing herself off to advantage no i have not replied richard and i am not likely to do so he pointedly added ah i felt sure of that my heart told me so when you went off that dreadful night leaving me to anguish and suspense i thought i should have died i never have had so to say a happy moment until this when i meet you again dont be a fool afy was richards gallant rejoinder borrowing the favorite reproach of miss carlyle i was young and green once you dont suppose i have remained so we will drop the past if you please how is mr jiffin oh the wretch shrieked afy is it possible that you can have fallen into the popular scandal that i have anything to say to him you know id never demean myself to it thats west lynne all over nothing but inventions in it from weeks end to weeks end a man who sells cheese who cuts up bacon well i am surprised at you mr richard i have been thinking what luck you were in to get him said richard with composure but it is your business not mine could you bear to see me stooping to him returned afy dropping her voice to the most insinuating whisper look you afy what ridiculous folly you are nursing in your head i dont trouble myself to guess but the sooner you get it out again the better i was an idiot once i dont deny it but you cured me of that and cured me with a vengeance you must pardon me for intimating that from henceforth we are strangers in the street as elsewhere i have resumed my own standing again which i periled when i ran after you afy turned faint how can you speak those cruel words gasped she you have called them forth i was told yesterday that afy hallijohn dressed up to a caricature was looking after me again it wont do afy ohoooh sobbed afy growing hysterical and is this to be all my recompense for the years i have spent pining after you keeping single for your sake recompense oh if you want that ill get my mother to give jiffin her custom and with a ringing laugh which though it had nothing of malice in it showed afy that he took her reproach for what it was worth richard turned in at his own gate it was a deathblow to afys vanity the worst it had ever received and she took a few minutes to compose herself and smooth her ruffled feathers then she turned and sailed back toward mr jiffins her turban up in the skies and the plume de coq tossing to the admiration of all beholders especially of miss carlyle who had the gratification of surveying her from her window arrived at mr jiffins she was taken ill exactly opposite his door and staggered into the shop in a most exhausted state round the counter flew mr jiffin leaving the shopman staring behind it what was the matter what could he do for her faintheat of the sunwalked too fastallowed to sit down for five minutes gasped afy in disjointed sentences mr jiffin tenderly conducted her through the shop to his parlor afy cast half an eye round saw how comfortable were its arrangements and her symptoms of faintness increased gasps and hysterical sobs came forth together mr jiffin was as one upon spikes shed recover better there than in the public shopif shed only excuse his bringing her in and consent to stop for a few minutes no harm could come to her and west lynne could never say it hed stand at the far end of the room right away from her hed prop open the two doors and the windows hed call in the maidanything she thought right should he get her a glass of wine afy declined the wine by a gesture and sat fanning herself mr jiffin looking on from a respectful distance gradually she grew composedgrew herself again as she gained courage mr jiffin lost it and he ventured upon some faint words of reproach of him afy burst into a laugh did i not do it well she exclaimed i thought id play off a joke upon you so i came out this afternoon and did it mr jiffin clasped his hands was it a joke he returned trembling with agitation uncertain whether he was in paradise or not are you still ready to let me call you mine of course it was a joke said afy what a soft you must have been mr jiffin not to see through it when young ladies engage themselves to be married you cant suppose they run back from it close upon the weddingday oh miss afy and the poor little man actually burst into delicious tears as he caught hold of afys hand and kissed it a great green donkey thought afy to herself bending on him however the sweetest smile rather but mr jiffin is not the only great donkey in the world richard hare meanwhile had entered his mothers presence she was sitting at the open window the justice opposite to her in an invalid chair basking in the air and the sun this last attack of the justices had affected the mind more than the body he was brought down to the sittingroom that day for the first time but of his mind there was little hope it was in a state of half imbecility the most wonderful characteristic being that all its selfwill its surliness had gone almost as a little child in tractability was justice hare richard came up to his mother and kissed her he had been to east lynne mrs hare took his hand and fondly held it the change in her was wonderful she was a young and happy woman again barbara has decided to go to the seaside mother mr carlyle takes her on monday i am glad my dear it will be sure to go her good richardbending over to her husband but still retaining her sons handbarbara has agreed to go to the seaside i will set her up ay ay nodded the justice set her up seaside cant we go certainly dear if you wish it when you shall be a little stronger ay ay nodded the justice again it was his usual answer now stronger wheres barbara she goes on monday sir said richard likewise bending his head only for a fortnight but they talk of going again later in the autumn cant i go too repeated the justice looking pleadingly in richards face you shall dear father who knows but a month or twos bracing would bring you quite round again we might go all together ourselves and the carlyles anne comes to stay with us next week you know and we might go when her visit is over aye all go together annes coming have you forgotten dear richard she comes to stay a month with us and mr clitheroe and the children i am so pleased she will find you better added mrs hare her gentle eyes filling mr wainwright says you may go out for a drive tomorrow and ill be coachman laughed richard it will be the old times come round again do you remember father my breaking the pole one moonlight night and your not letting me drive for six months afterwards the poor justice laughed in answer to richard laughed till the tears ran down his face probably not knowing in the least what he was laughing at richard said mrs hare to her son almost in an apprehensive tone her hand pressing his nervously was not that afy hallijohn i saw you speaking with at the gate did you what a spectacle she had made of herself i wonder she is not ashamed to go through the streets in such a guise indeed i wonder she shows herself at all richard youyouwill not be drawn in again were the next whispered words mother there was a sternness in his mild blue eyes as he cast them upon his mother those beautiful eyesthe very counterpart of barbaras both his and hers the counterpart of mrs hares the look had been sufficient refutation without words mother mine i am going to belong to you in the future and to nobody </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> nobody else west lynne is already busy for me i understand pleasantly carving out my destiny one marvels whether i shall lose myself with miss afy another that i shall set on offhand and court louisa dobede they are all wrong my place will be with my darling motherat least for several years to come she clasped his hand to her bosom in her glad delight we want happiness together mother to enable us to forget the past for upon none did the blow fall as upon you and upon me and the happiness we shall find in our own home living for each other and striving to amuse my poor father aye aye complacently put in justice hare so it would be richard had returned to his home had become to all intent and purposes its master for the justice would never be in a state to hold sway again he had resumed his position and regained the favor of west lynne which always in extremes was now wanting to kill him with kindness a happy happy home from henceforth and mrs hare lifted up her full heart in thankfulness to god perhaps richards went up also one word touching that wretched prisoner in the condemned cell at lynneborough as you must have anticipated the extreme sentence was not carried out and little favorite as sir francis is with you and with me we can but admit that justice did not demand that it should be that he had willfully killed hallijohn was certain but the act was committed in a moment of wild rage it had not been premeditated the sentence was commuted to transportation a far more disgraceful one in the estimation of sir francis a far more unwelcome one in the eyes of his wife it is no use to mince the truth one little grain of comfort had penetrated to lady levison the anticipation of the time when she and her illfated child should be alone and could hide themselves in some hidden nook of the wide world he and his crime and his end gone forgotten but it seems he was not to go and be forgotten she and the boy must be tied to him still and she was lost in horror and rebellion he envied the dead hallijohn did that man as he looked forth on the future a cheering prospect truly the gay sir francis levison working in chains with his gang where would his diamonds and his perfumed handkerchiefs and his white hands be then after a time he might get a ticketofleave he groaned in agony as the turnkey suggested it to him a ticketofleave for him oh why did they not hang him he wailed forth as he closed his eyes to the dim light the light of the cell you understand he could not close them to the light of the future no never again it shone out all too plainly dazzling his brain as with a flame of living fire </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlvi until eternity barbara was at the seaside and lady isabel was in her bed dying you remember the old french saying lhomme propose et dieu dispose an exemplification of it was here she lady isabel had consented to remain at east lynne during mrs carlyles absence on purpose that she might be with her children but the object was frustrated for lucy and archibald had been removed to miss carlyles it was mr carlyles arrangement he thought the governess ought to have entire respite from all charge and that poor governess dared not say let them stay with me lady isabel had also purposed to be safely away from east lynne before the time came for her to die but that time had advanced with giant strides and the period for removal was past she was going out as her mother had done rapidly unexpectedly like the snuff of a candle wilson was in attendance on her mistress joyce remained at home barbara had chosen a wateringplace near not thirty miles off so that mr carlyle went there most evenings returning to his office in the mornings thus he saw little of east lynne paying one or two flying visits only from the saturday to the wednesday in the second week he did not come home at all and it was in those few days that lady isabel had changed for the worse on the wednesday he was expected home to dinner and to sleep joyce was in a state of frenzyor next door to it lady isabel was dying and what would become of the ominous secret a conviction born of her fears was on the girls mind that with death the whole must become known and who was to foresee what blame might not be cast upon her by her master and mistress for not having disclosed it she might be accused of having been an abettor in the plot from the first fifty times it was in joyces mind to send for miss carlyle and tell her all the afternoon was fast waning and the spirit of lady isabel seemed to be waning with it joyce was in the room in attendance upon her she had been in a fainting state all day but felt better now she was partially raised in bed by pillows a white cashmere shawl over her shoulders her nightcap off to allow as much air as possible to come to her and the windows stood open footsteps sounded on the gravel in the quiet stillness of the summer air they penetrated even to her ear for all her faculties were keen yet beloved footsteps and a tinge of hectic rose to her cheeks joyce who stood at the window glanced out it was mr carlyle joyce came forth a cry from the bed sharp and eager joyce turned round my lady i should die happily if i might see him see him uttered joyce doubting her own ears my lady see him mr carlyle what can it signify i am already as one dead should i ask it or wish it think you in rude life the yearning has been upon me for days joyce it is keeping death away it could not be my lady was the decisive answer it must not be it is as a thing impossible lady isabel burst into tears i cant die for the trouble she wailed you keep my children from me they must not come you say lest i should betray myself now you would keep my husband joyce joyce let me see him her husband poor thing joyce was in a maze of distress though not the less firm her eyes were wet with tears but she believed she should be infringing her allegiance to her mistress did she bring mr carlyle to the presence of his former wife altogether it might be productive of nothing but confusion a knock at the chamber door joyce called out come in the two maids hannah and sarah were alone in the habit of coming to the room and neither of them had ever known madame vine as lady isabel sarah put in her head master wants you miss joyce ill come he is in the diningroom i have just taken down master arthur to him mr carlyle had got master arthur on his shoulder when joyce entered master arthur was decidedly given to noise and rebellion and was already as wilson expressed it sturdy upon his pins how is madame vine joyce joyce scarcely knew how to answer but she did not dare to equivocate as to her precarious state and where the use when a few hours would probably see the end of it she is very ill indeed sir worse sir i fear she is dying mr carlyle in his consternation put down arthur dying i hardly think she will last till morning sir why what has killed her he uttered in amazement joyce did not answer she looked pale and confused have you had dr martin oh no sir it would be of no use no use repeated mr carlyle in a sharp accent is that the way to treat dying people assume it is of no use to send for advice and so quietly let them die if madame vine is as ill as you say a telegraphic message must be sent off at once i had better see her he cried moving to the door joyce in her perplexity dared to place her back against it preventing his egress oh master i beg your pardon butit would not be right please sir do not think of going into her room mr carlyle thought joyce was taken with a fit of prudery why cant i go in he asked mrs carlyle would not like it sir stammered joyce her cheeks scarlet now mr carlyle stared at her some of you take up odd ideas he cried in mrs carlyles absence it is necessary that some one should see her let a lady die in my house and never see after her you are out of your senses joyce i shall go in after dinner so prepare madame vine the dinner was being brought in then joyce feeling like one in a nervous attack picked up arthur and carried him to sarah in the nursery what on earth was she to do scarcely had mr carlyle begun his dinner when his sister entered some grievance had arisen between her and the tenants of certain houses of hers and she was bringing the dispute to him before he would hear it he begged her to go up to madame vine telling her what joyce had said of her state dying exclaimed miss corny in disbelieving derision that joyce has been more like a simpleton lately than like herself i cant think what has come to the woman she took off her bonnet and mantle and laid them on a chair gave a twitch or two to her cap as she surveyed it in the pierglass and went upstairs joyce answered her knock at the invalids door and joyce when she saw who it was turned as white as any sheet oh maam you must not come in she blundered out in her confusion and fear as she put herself right in the doorway who is to keep me out demanded miss carlyle after a pause of surprise her tone of quiet power move away girl joyce i think your brain must be softening what will you try at next joyce was powerless both in right and strength and she knew it she knew there was no helpthat miss carlyle would and must enter she stood aside shivering and passed out of the room as soon as miss carlyle was within it ah there could no longer be concealment now there she was her pale face lying against the pillow free from its disguising trappings the band of gray velvet the spectacles the wraps for the throat and chin the huge cap all were gone it was the face of lady isabel changed certainly very very much but still hers the silvered hair fell on either side of her face like the silky curls had once fallen the sweet sad eyes were the eyes of yore mercy be good to us uttered miss carlyle they remained gazing at each other both panting with emotion yes even miss carlyle though a wild suspicion had once crossed her brain that madame vine might be lady isabel it had died away again from the sheer improbability of the thing as much as from the convincing proofs offered by lord mount severn not but what miss carlyle had borne in mind the suspicion and had been fond of tracing the likeness in madame vines face how could you dare come back here she abruptly asked her tone of sad soft wailing not one of reproach lady isabel humbly crossed her attenuated hands upon her chest my children she whispered how could i stay away from them have pity miss carlyle dont reproach me i am on my way to god to answer for all my sins and sorrows i do not reproach you said miss carlyle i am so glad to go she continued to murmur her eyes </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> eyes full of tears jesus did not come you know to save the good like you he came for the sake of us poor sinners i tried to take up my cross as he bade us and bear it bravely for his sake but its weight has killed me the good like you humbly meekly deferentially was it expressed in all good faith and trust as though miss corny was a sort of upper angel somehow the words grated on miss cornys ear grated fiercely on her conscience it came into her mind then as she stood there that the harsh religion that she had through life professed was not the religion that would best bring peace to her dying bed child said she drawing near to and leaning over lady isabel had i anything to do with sending you from east lynne lady isabel shook her head and cast down her gaze as she whispered you did not send me you did not help to send me i was not very happy with you but that was not the causeof my going away forgive me miss carlyle forgive me thank god inwardly breathed miss carlyle forgive me she said aloud and in agitation touching her hand i could have made your home happier and i wish i had done it i have wished it ever since you left it lady isabel drew the hand in hers i want to see archibald she whispered going back in thought to the old time and the old name i have prayed joyce to bring him to me and she will not only for a minute just to hear him say that he forgives me what can it matter now that i am as one lost to the world i should die easier upon what impulse or grounds miss carlyle saw fit to accede to the request cannot be told probably she did not choose to refuse a deathbed prayer possibly she reasoned as did lady isabelwhat could it matter she went to the door joyce was in the corridor leaning against the wall her apron up to her eyes miss carlyle beckoned to her how long have you known of this since that night in the spring when there was an alarm of fire i saw her then with nothing on her face and knew her though at the first moment i thought it was her ghost maam i have just gone about since like a ghost myself from fear go and request your master to come up to me oh maam will it be well to tell him remonstrated joyce well that he should see her go and request your master to come to me unequivocally repeated miss carlyle are you mistress joyce or am i joyce went down and brought mr carlyle up from the dinnertable is madame vine worse cornelia will she see me she wishes to see you miss carlyle opened the door as she spoke he motioned her to pass in first no she said you had better see her alone he was going in when joyce caught his arm master master you ought to be prepared maam wont you tell him he looked at them thinking they must be moonstruck for their conduct seemed inexplicable both were in evident agitation an emotion miss carlyle was not given to her face and lips were twitching but she kept a studied silence mr carlyle knit his brow and went into the chamber they shut him in he walked gently at once to the bed in his straightforward manner i am grieved madame vine the words faltered on his tongue he was a man as little given to show emotion as man can well be did he think as joyce had once done that it was a ghost he saw certain it is that his face and lips turned the hue of death and he backed a few steps from the bed the falling hair the sweet mournful eyes the hectic which his presence brought to her cheeks told too plainly of the lady isabel archibald she put out her trembling hand she caught him ere he had drawn quite beyond her reach he looked at her he looked round the room as does one awaking from a dream i could not die without your forgiveness she murmured her eyes falling before him as she thought of her past do you turn from me bear with me a little minute only say you forgive me and i shall die in peace isabel he spoke not knowing in the least what he said are youare youwere you madame vine oh forgiveforgive me i did not die i got well from the accident but it changed me dreadfully nobody knew me and i came here as madame vine i could not stay away archibald forgive me his mind was in a whirl his ideas had gone woolgathering the first clear thought that came thumping through his brain was that he must be a man of two wives she noticed his perplexed silence i could not stay away from you and my children the longing for you was killing me she reiterated wildly like one talking in a fever i never knew a moments peace after the mad act i was guilty of in quitting you not an hour had i departed when my repentance set in and even then i would have retraced and come back but i did not know how see what it has done for me tossing up her gray hair holding out her attenuated wrists oh forgiveforgive me my sin was great but my punishment was greater it has been as one long scene of mortal agony why did you go asked mr carlyle did you not know no it has always been a mystery to me i went out of love for you a shade of disdain crossed his lips she was equivocating to him on her deathbed do not look in that way she panted my strength is nearly goneyou must perceive that it isand i do not perhaps express myself clearly i loved you dearly and i grew suspicious of you i thought you were false and deceitful to me that your love was all given to another and in my sore jealousy i listened to the temptings of that bad man who whispered to me of revenge it was not so was it mr carlyle had regained his calmness outwardly at any rate he stood by the side of the bed looking down upon her his arms crossed upon his chest and his noble form raised to its full height was it so she feverishly repeated can you ask it knowing me as you did then as you must have known me since i never was false to you in thought in word or in deed oh archibald i was madi was mad i could not have done it in anything but madness surely you will forget and forgive i cannot forget i have already forgiven try and forget the dreadful time that has passed since that night she continued the tears falling on her cheeks as she held up to him one of her poor hot hands let your thoughts go back to the days when you first knew me when i was here isabel vane a happy girl with my father at times i have lost myself in a moments happiness in thinking of it do you remember how you grew to love me though you thought you might not tell it to meand how gentle you were with me when papa diedand the hundred pound note do you remember coming to castle marlingand my promise to be your wifeand the first kiss you left upon my lips and oh archibald do you remember the loving days after i was your wifehow happy we were with each other do you remember when lucy was born we thought i should have died and your joy your thankfulness that god restored me do you remember all this aye he did remember it he took the poor hand into his and unconsciously played with its wasted fingers have you any reproach to cast to me he gently said bending his head a little reproach to you to you who must be almost without reproach in the sight of heaven you who were everlasting to meever anxious for my welfare when i think of what you were and are and how i quitted you i could sink into the earth with remorse and shame my own sin i have surely expiated i cannot expiate the shame i entailed upon you and upon our children never he felt it as keenly now as he had felt it then think what it has been for me she resumed and he was obliged to bend his ear to catch her gradually weakening tones to live in this house with your wifeto see your love for herto watch the envied caresses that once were mine i never loved you so passionately as i have done since i lost you think what it was to watch williams decaying strength to be alone with him in his dying hour and not to be able to say he is my child as well as yours when he lay dead and the news went forth to the household it was her petty grief you soothed not mine his mothers god alone knows how i have lived through it all it as been to me as the bitterness of death why did you come back was the response of mr carlyle i have told you i could not live wanting you and my children it was wrong wrong in all ways wickedly wrong you cannot think worse of it than i have done but the consequences and the punishment would be mine alone as long as i guarded against discovery i never thought to stop here to die but death seems to have come on me with a leap like it came to my mother a pause of labored hard breathing mr carlyle did not interrupt it all wrong all wrong she resumed this interview with you among the rest and yeti hardly know it cannot hurt the new ties you have formed for i am as one dead now to this world hovering on the brink of the next but you were my husband archibald and the last few days i have longed for your forgiveness with a fevered longing oh that the past could be blotted out that i could wake up and find it but a hideous dream that i were here as in old days in health and happiness your ever loving wife do you wish it that the dark past had never had place she put the question in a sharp eager tone gazing up to him with an anxious gaze as though the answer must be one of life or death for your sake i wish it calm enough were the words spoken and her eyes fell again and a deep sigh came forth i am going to william but lucy and archibald will be left oh do you never be unkind to them i pray you visit not their mothers sin upon their heads do not in your love for your later children lose your love for them have you seen anything in my conduct that could give rise to fears of this he returned reproach mingled in his sad tone the children are dear to me as you once were as i once was aye and as i might have been now indeed you might he answered with emotion the fault was not mine archibald i am on the very threshold of the next world will you not bless mewill you not say a word of love to me before i pass it let what i am i say be blotted for the moment from your memory think of me if you can as the innocent timid child whom you made your wife only a word of love my heart is breaking for it he leaned over her he pushed aside the hair from her brow with his gentle hand his tears dropping on her face you nearly broke mine when you </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> you left me isabel he whispered may god bless you and take you to his rest in heaven may he so deal with me as i now fully and freely forgive you what was he about to do lower and lower bent his head until his breath nearly mingled with hers to kiss her he best knew but suddenly his face grew red with a scarlet flush and he lifted it again did the form of one then in a felons cell at lynneborough thrust itself before him or that of his absent and unconscious wife to his rest in heaven she murmured in the hollow tones of the departing yes yes i know that god had forgiven me oh what a struggle it has been nothing but bad feelings rebellion and sorrow and repining for a long while after i came back here but jesus prayed for me and helped me and you know how merciful he is to the weary and heavyladen we shall meet again archibald and live together forever and ever but for that great hope i could hardly die william said mamma would be on the banks of the river looking out for him but it is william who is looking for me mr carlyle released one of his hands she had taken them both and with his own white handkerchief wiped the deathdew from her forehead it is no sin to anticipate it archibald for there will be no marrying or giving in marriage in heaven christ said so though we do not know how it will be my sin will be remembered no more there and we shall be together with our children forever and forever keep a little corner in your heart for your poor lost isabel yes yes he whispered are you leaving me she uttered in a wild tone of pain you are growing faint i perceive i must call assistance farewell then farewell until eternity she sighed the tears raining from her eyes it is death i think not faintness oh but it is hard to part farewell farewell my once dear husband she raised her head from the pillow excitement giving her strength she clung to his arm she lifted her face in its sad yearning mr carlyle laid her tenderly down again and suffered his wet cheek to rest upon hers until eternity she followed him with her eyes as he retreated and watched him from the room then turned her face to the wall it is over only god now mr carlyle took an instants counsel with himself stopping at the head of the stairs to do it joyce in obedience to a sign from him had already gone into the sickchamber his sister was standing at the door cornelia she followed him down to the diningroom you will remain here tonight with her do you suppose i shouldnt crossly responded miss corny where are you off to now to the telegraph office at present to send for lord mount severn what good can he do none but i shall send for him cant one of the servants go just as well as you you have not finished your dinner hardly begun it he turned his eyes on the dinnertable in a mechanical sort of way his mind wholly preoccupied made some remark in answer which miss corny did not catch and went out on his return his sister met him in the hall drew him inside the nearest room and closed the door lady isabel was dead had been dead about ten minutes she never spoke after you left her archibald there was a slight struggle at the last a fighting for breath otherwise she went off quite peacefully i felt sure when i first saw her this afternoon that she could not last till midnight </chapter>

<chapter>chapter xlvii i m v lord mount severn wondering greatly what the urgent summons could be for lost no time in obeying it and was at east lynne the following morning early mr carlyle had his carriage at the stationhis close carriageand shut up in that he made the communication to the earl as they drove to east lynne the earl could with difficulty believe it never had he been so utterly astonished at first he really could not understand the tale did shedid shecome back to your house to die he blundered you never took her in i dont understand mr carlyle explained further and the earl at length understood but he did not recover his perplexed astonishment what a mad act to come back here madame vine how on earth did she escape detection she did escape it said mr carlyle the strange likeness madame vine possessed to my first wife did often strike me as being marvelous but i never suspected the truth it was a likeness and not a likeness for every part of her face and form was changed except her eyes and those i never saw but through those disguising glasses the earl wiped his hot face the news had ruffled him no measured degree he felt angry with isabel dead though she was and thankful that mrs carlyle was away will you see her whispered mr carlyle as they entered the house yes they went up to the deathchamber mr carlyle procuring the key it was the only time that he entered it very peaceful she looked now her pale features so composed under her white cap and hands miss carlyle and joyce had done all that was necessary nobody else had been suffered to approach her lord mount severn leaned over her tracing the former looks of isabel and the likeness grew upon him in a wonderful degree what did she die of he asked she said a broken heart ah said the earl the wonder is that it did not break before poor thing poor isabel he added touching her hand how she marred her own happiness carlyle i suppose this is your wedding ring mr carlyle cast his eyes upon the ring very probably to think of her never having discarded it remarked the earl releasing the cold hand well i can hardly believe the tale now he turned and quitted the room as he spoke mr carlyle looked steadfastly at the dead face for a minute or two his fingers touching the forehead but what his thoughts or feelings may have been none can tell then he replaced the sheet over her face and followed the earl they descended in silence to the breakfastroom miss carlyle was seated at the table waiting for them where could all your eyes have been exclaimed the earl to her after a few sentences referring to the event just passed just where yours would have been replied miss corny with a touch of her old temper you saw madame vine as well as we did but not continuously only two or three times in all and i do not remember ever to have seen her without her bonnet and veil that carlyle should not have recognized her is almost beyond belief it seems so to speak of it said miss corny but facts are facts she was young and gay active when she left here upright as a dart her dark hair drawn from her open brow and flowing on her neck her cheeks like crimson paint her face altogether beautiful madame vine arrived here a pale stooping woman lame of one leg shorter than lady isabeland her figure stuffed out under those sacks of jackets not a bit scarcely of her forehead to be seen for gray velvet and gray bands of hair her head smothered under a close cap large blue double spectacles hiding the eyes and their sides and the throat tied up the chin partially the mouth was entirely altered in its character and that upward scar always so conspicuous made it almost ugly then she had lost some of her front teeth you know and she lisped when she spoke take her for all in all summed up miss carlyle she looked no more like isabel who went away from here than i look like adam just get your dearest friend damaged and disguised as she was my lord and see if youd recognize him the observation came home to lord mount severn a gentleman whom he knew well had been so altered by a fearful accident that little resemblance could be traced to his former self in fact his own family could not recognize him and he used an artificial disguise it was a case in point andreaderi assure you it was a true one it was the disguise that we ought to have suspected quietly observed mr carlyle the likeness was not sufficiently striking to cause suspicion but she turned the house from that scent as soon as she came into it struck in miss corny telling of the neuralgic pains that affected her head and face rendering the guarding them from exposure necessary remember lord mount severn that the ducies had been with her in germany and had never suspected her remember also another thing that however great a likeness we may have detected we could not and did not speak of it one to another lady isabels name is never so much as whispered among us true all true nodded the earl and they sat themselves down to breakfast on the friday the following letter was dispatched to mrs carlyle my dearesti find i shall not be able to get to you on saturday afternoon as i promised but will leave here by the late train that night mind you dont sit up for me lord mount severn is here for a few days he sends his regards to you and now barbara prepare for news that will prove a shock madame vine is dead she grew rapidly worse they tell me after our departure and died on wednesday night i am glad you were away love from the children lucy and archie are still at cornelias arthur wearing out sarahs legs in the nursery ever yours my dearest archibald carlyle of course as madame vine the governess died at mr carlyles house he could not in courtesy do less than follow her to the grave so decided west lynne when they found which way the wind was going to blow lord mount severn followed also to keep him company being on a visit to him and very polite indeed of his lordship to do itcondescending also west lynne remembered another funeral at which those two had been the only mournersthat of the earl by some curious coincidence the french governess was buried close to the earls grave as good there as anywhere else quoth west lynne there happened to be a vacant spot of ground the funeral took place on a sunday morning a plain respectable funeral a hearse and pair and mourning coach and pair with a chariot for the rev mr little no pallbearers or mutes or anything of that showoff kind and no plumes on the horses only on the hearse west lynne looked on with approbation and conjectured that the governess had left sufficient money to bury herself but of course that was mr carlyles affair not west lynnes quiet enough lay she in her last restingplace they left her in it the earl and mr carlyle and entered the mourningcoach to be conveyed back again to east lynne just a little stone of white marble two feet high by a foot and a half broad remarked the earl on their road pursuing a topic they were speaking upon with the initials i v and the date of the year nothing more what do you think i m v corrected mr carlyle yes at this moment the bells of another church not st judes broke out in a joyous peal and the earl inclined his ear to listen what can they be ringing for he cried they were ringing for a wedding afy hallijohn by the help of two clergymen and six bridesmaids of which you may be sure joyce was not one had just been converted into mrs joe jiffin when afy took a thing into her heard she somehow contrived to carry it through and to bend even clergymen and bridesmaids to </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> to her will mr jiffin was blest at last in the afternoon the earl left east lynne and somewhat later barbara arrived at it wilson scarcely gave her mistress time to step into the house before her and she very nearly left the baby in the fly curiously anxious was wilson to hear all particulars as to whatever could have took off that french governess mr carlyle was much surprised at their arrival how could i stay away archibald even until monday after the news you sent me said barbara what did she die of it must have been awfully sudden i suppose so was his dreamy answer he was debating a question with himself one he had thought over a good deal since wednesday night should he or should he not tell his wife he would have preferred not to tell her and were the secret confined to his own breast he would decidedly not have done so but it was known to three othersto miss carlyle to lord mount severn and to joyce all trustworthy and of good intention but it was impossible for mr carlyle to make sure that not one of them would ever through any chance and unpremeditated word let the secret come to the knowledge of mrs carlyle that would not do if she must hear it at all she must hear it from him and at once he took his course are you ill archibald she asked noting his face it wore a pale worn sort of look i have something to tell you barbara he answered drawing her hand into his as they stood together they were in her dressingroom where she was taking off her things on the wednesday evening when i got home to dinner joyce told me that she feared madame vine was dying and i thought it right to see her certainly returned barbara quite right i went into her room and i found that she was dying but i found something else barbara she was not madame vine not madame vine echoed barbara believing in good truth that her husband could not know what he was saying it was my former wife isabel vane barbaras face flushed crimson and then grew white as marble and she drew her hand unconsciously from mr carlyless he did not appear to notice the movement but stood with his elbow on the mantelpiece while he talked giving her a rapid summary of the interview and its details she could not stay away from her children she said and came back as madame vine what with the effects of the railroad accident in france and those spectacles she wore and her style of dress and her gray hair she felt secure in not being recognized i am astonished now that she was not discovered were such a thing related to me i should give no credence to it barbaras heart felt faint with its utter sickness and she turned her face from the view of her husband her first confused thoughts were as mr carlyles had beenthat she had been living in his house with another wife did you suspect her she breathed in a low tone barbara had i suspected it should i have allowed it to go on she implored my forgiveness for the past and for having returned here and i gave it to her fully i then went to west lynne to telegraph to mount severn and when i came back she was dead there was a pause mr carlyle began to perceive that his wifes face was hidden from him she said her heart was broken barbara we cannot wonder at it there was no reply mr carlyle took his arm from the mantelpiece and moved so that he could see her countenance a wan countenance telling of pain he laid his hand upon her shoulder and made her look at him my dearest what is this oh archibald she uttered clasping her hands together all her pent up feelings bursting forth and the tears streaming from her eyes has this taken your love from me he took both her hands in one of his he put the other round her waist and held her there before him never speaking only looking gravely into her face who could look at its sincere truthfulness at the sweet expression of his lips and doubt him not barbara she allowed the moments excitement to act upon her feelings and carry her away i had thought my wife possessed entire trust in me oh i do i do you know i do forgive me archibald she slowly whispered i deemed it better to impart this to you barbara had there been wrong feeling on my part i should have left you in ignorance my darling i have told you it in love she was leaning on his breast sobbing gently her repentant face turned towards him he held her there in his strong protection his enduring tenderness my wife my darling now and always it was a foolish feeling to cross my heart archibald it is done with and gone never let it come back barbara neither need her name be mentioned again between us a barred name it has hitherto been so let it continue anything you will my earnest wish is to please you to be worthy of your esteem and love archibald she timidly added her eyelids drooping and her fair cheeks blushing as she made the confession there has been a feeling in my heart against your children a sort of jealous feeling you can understand because they were hers because she had once been your wife i knew how wrong it was and i have tried earnestly to subdue it i have indeed and i think it is nearly gone her voice sunk i constantly pray to be helped to do it to love them and care for them as if they were my own it will come with time every good thing will come with time that we may earnestly seek said mr carlyle oh barbara never forgetnever forget that the only way to ensure peace in the end is to strive always to be doing right unselfishly under </chapter></highSuspense4>
