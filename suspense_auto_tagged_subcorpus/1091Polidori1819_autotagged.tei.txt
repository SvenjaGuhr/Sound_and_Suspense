upon the left side of the lake of thim lies the small village of beatenberg which under the care of a simple pastor contains no individual above the rank of a peasant it was in this village that i was born misfortune seemed to be anxious at my very birth to stamp me for its own just at the termination of the short war between austria and prussia of the year 1778 my mother arrived at this village in company with a gentleman severely wounded as he said in the slight skir mishes which had alone formed the mi litary display of this campaign there </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> there was a mystery about them which they seemed to wish should not be unravelled the worthy pastor therefore whom i have since called father did not make any inquiries of his guests though it ap peared to him very singular that the most difficult and steep roads should have been preferred for the route of an invalid towards his home the tender care of my mother towards this gentleman was exemplary it seemed as if that courage and firmness which was wanting in his breast had taken refuge in hers they were not swiss for the language they spoke was unknown to berchtold the parish priest they apparently under

she at last fell exhausted upon the ground she was conveyed to bed and in a few hours i and a sister saw the light but this did not allay her grief she sunk into a silence that nothing could induce her to break her eyes were fixed and she at last died without a struggle she was buried by him whom berchtold imagined in spite of the disparity of his yeafs to have been her husband j and over their grave were placed those simple crosses which you must have seen in the neighbouring churchyard3 the pastor could not place any inscription upon their tomb for he had been so engaged in attendance upon my mother that he had not noticed the departure of her only servant who took with him every thing of value belonging to his former mistress he knew not what to do there </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> there was no clue in his hands by which he could restore us to out family for there was nothing to be found except some linen and a locket with my mothers portrait berchtold was a man whose humble endeavours had always been engaged in the attempt to fulfill those duties his profession imposed upon him in these mountainous districts the office of a parish priest is extremely arduous he is often called up in the middle of the night while the snow is falling to go many miles over the frqen glaciers to administer to the dying peasant the sacraments of the church berchtold never allowed the most distant hamlet to want religious comfort he was old yet often has he crossed to the foot of the holgaut merely to help the unfor tunatein their attempt at resignation under domestic calamity he was not therefore likely to east us from him he immediately had us conveyed tothe cottage of a married sister and caused us to be brought up as luxuriously as an alpine village allowed> i remefibet

told me that i was indeed an orphan that i was not his child he then tpok me to the churchyard and pointing to the raised sod he told me my parents were there i did not clearly understand him 1 had then no plea of death my mother for so l called his sister had told me tales of the dead but these terrified without </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> without being understood all the graves save those of my parents were adorned with flowers upon my remarking this to him he told me that they haying ded strangers there none were boppd tolpyf them i was hurt to see those flowers which though faded

formerly were employed in adorning my sisterv head oftett have 1 laid myself down looking uponctheir grassy covering as if i expected that some ofthose tales of my mother would lie realised with regard to mysdf and that i should see them rising ftom their graven my sister sooh joined me in these meditations and almost the first infantile communications which passed between us rested upon another wdrld she would sit by me and often the worthy pastor surprised us after the sun had set calling to our memory those tales we had heard when with our foster mother we did not mingle with the other children of the village for we delighted1 too much in each others company j we spent hours together in talking about what had in a most unaccountable man ner taken possession of our minds or else we gamboled round bercfatold he debarred by his religion from the enjoyment of a domestic circle of his own children had formed so strong an attachment to us that his greatest delight was when not engaged in his parochial duties to join us in our games and infantile occupations with all the simplicity of old age he would lie down and allow us to play with his white locks or tell us stories which though of a different nature from those of his sister did not interest us the less he was a good classical scholar and was well versed in the history of his own country from these sources he drew histales and at an early age he inspired me with an ardent love for independence and liberty at the same time that heinstilled into my heart a burning thirst for the means of asserting a superiority over my equals the anecdotes of themistocles alcibiades and others upon whom the fates of their country had depended rested on my mind berchtold described to me the fallen glories of home of that nation which once held sway over the known world in short there was a material deffeet in my education which is not uncommon my imagination was stimulated while my judgment was not called forth and i was taught to admire public instead of private virtues i rested upon </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> upon those situations which one in the million attains and in which the passions of ethers are to be guided while i was not ahown how to conduct myself when my own inclinations and feelings might at tenf>t to lead me astray in the common occurrences of life with a strongly ausoeptible mind i imbibed deeply these first impressions and throughout life this defect in my education has followed me as i advanced in age i gradually beoame acquainted with the latin and greek historians berchtold rashly though innocently toek advantageuf my thirst for relations of battles and deeds of renown to induce me to leafn j consequently had plutarch and livy ip pay hands long before i read any hpol tending to give man the power of regulating his passions i joined the villagers pply in those military exercises which are constantly performed after the days labour in every hamlet sometimes i would go with the chamois hunters apd reaching the higher ridges of the alps whose snowy summits ivere visible from the lake i forced myself to follow him in his venturous pursuit but it for a ipng time required astrong exertion of my mind tp induce me to venture amidst the vast solitude of eternal snows i always felt an ipward shuddering and awe at the sight of my native wildnesses even pow i cannot hear to listen to those who amongst our magnificent scenes which man ha not yet overcome and which mock his power can talk of pleasure and 4 upon the beauty of the scenery leans feel this i seem always to crouch beneath some invisible being whose power is infinite and which i am conscious i cannot resist it seems that i hear him laughing audibly at our vain attempts to encroach upon his dominion it appears to me as if the avalanche were blit the weapon of his impatience while he insidiously steals upon those habitations he has covered with his snows by the silent gradual approach of the glaciers let mankind labour for ages tiponitheseribs of the world and their work shall not be seen the pyramids might rise unnoticed upon the rocks before my view undistinguished from the fragment that falls un perceived with the passing torrent i cannot bear that human strength should be unable to stamp its hand upon these towering merrforials of convulsions we could wot influence could not hope to contrdul this morbid feeling may have been excited by my foster mother constantly pointing to the jungfrau whose white peak forms so prominent a feature in the view from her house while she related the peasants tale of those mischievous spirits who dance upon its glittering icy </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> icy coat decked by the moons ray i gained however health and vigour from these excursions and i became at last one of the most noted for activity in all the canton i rapidly arrived at my twentieth year my kind friend the pastor could not be induced to part with me i was the only prop of his old age i latterly always accompanied him in his visits amongst the mountains often joined him in his prayer over the dying and frequently have i supported him at the brink of that grave over which he was calling down the mercy of god and which was soon to be his own refuge my sisteritf creased in beauty and each day added some new charm to her person add some additional accomplishment to her mind i often represented to my father that i was of an age when i should begin to do something and attempt to take the bprthen of myself and my sister off his hands he would agree with me in my arguments but when the moment came he was always so overpowered with sorrow that 1 could not induce myself to leave him for the few remaining days he had to live 1 seldom visited thun or interlaken i did not feel pleasure in the society of men i there found them engaged in all fthe petty interestswhich pervade human breasts in the narrow sphere of a miserable provincial town i found they could not sympathise with one whom hey looked upon as a wild romantic mountaineer about this time the french revolution began to exalt my imagination mien more than the history of nations gpne by and i burnt with te desire of m0gij9g nearer those yactipns which jn jtm solitary villageofity softened sound of their horrors seemed to wear a certain air of grandeur and glory i ardently wished to join those soldiers who had driven back the foreign invaders from their native plains i little thought then how soon i was to be engaged in resisting these very men amidst ray own native mountains when the discussions between berne and the french concerning the fays de vend arrested the attention of all anxious to be amongst men in action and tired of my total want of employment i again begged my friend to let me depart to the capital but still at his prayer i remained with him i laid myself down upon the snow shining as it then was in the first rays of spring and abandoned myself to visions of battle and renown my spirits gradually left me there was a craving for exertion about me which l found it impossible jfco overcome </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> overcome i sawed any gun and going amidst foe eternal glaciers and nocks 1 sought fay forcing myself to exert my body to lose this feeling of vacuity but i often lost sight of the chamois engaged in the thought of my country and bounded from rock to rock no longer occupied with what i imagined was before me my sister would endeavour to sooth me by her caresses i told her of my visions with regard to my countrys cause and at moments excited even in her breast the sparks of enthusiasm but she generally echoed berchtolds sentiments with regard to the indecision and incapacity of the government tired one evening of listening to berchtold who attempted to repress my ardour by representing to me that the country was betrayed and that in consequence of the tardiness and imbecility of the rulers of switzerland in spite of the courage and daring of its peasantry it was doomed to become an easy prey to france i left him determined again to seek refuge in the chase 1 according ly set out the next morning intending to remain several days amongst the mountains but i grew listless and at the close of the second day i still found myself ujion the wengern alp i issued forth from the chalet where i had taken some refreshment and soon lost myself in reflection i now looked with pleasure upon the jungfraus white head glisten mg on the blue canopy of heaven all the horrors of the grindewald at my feet the high summit of the schrechorn with the echoing thunders of the numerous avalanches no longer appalled me it seemed as if they now put on their terrors against a presumptuous foe in defence of their children there was no cloud upon the dark blue skythere was no mist upon the rocks and though the snow still covered the whole surface of the mountains around still there was a genial warmth and splendour in the suns reflected ray that vivified and strengthened there was no sound save that of the distant cataract and falling avalanche i stood along time leaning upon my musket to look upon this scene how could avarice hope to find a resting place in the minds of those nursed amidst such objects how could slavery expect to find its votaries resident amidst such fortresses the tyrant could not dare to add these horrors of nature to those already revelling in his breast a slave who shrinks before the frown of a despot could not stand erect amidst these awful monuments of a power that mocks at human prowess upon this occasion it seemed as if the sun threw its proudest </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> proudest ray upon these rocks they had seen might hope to see men worthy of gazing upon that nature which lifting unappalled its head amidst the thundering clouds had snatched their weapon from their grasp and had thrown it at its feet while with its snowy head it struck in defiance the arching canopy of heaven 1 was thus engaged in thought which but served to increase my indignation at the conduct of men who sacrificed to personal interest the safety of their country when i waa suddenly struck with the sound of a voice which i shall never never forget in unison with my feelings at that moment the notes sometimes brake out into the wildest fcories of defiance at others suddenly sinking they seemed uncertain and soothing 1 dared not look around i felt as if entranced and i imagined i heard the voice of these mountain mocking the invaders then sinking into despondence gradually the voice approachedi could distinguish words i heard footsteps i suddenly turned sound and beheld a figure i cannot describe it to you arrayed io a dress foreign to these mountains her white drapery breathed on by the wanton breeze now betrayed the delicate form of her limbs now hid them from my sight her dark eye seemed exultingly to a ribbond with which she was playing that as i said 1 might wear it in remembrance of her who had made me decide upon joining the patriots blushing she looked at her father who smiled consent and she bound round my arm the scarf which she had worn during the morning i have often heard that song again i have often seen that form and many are the years i have worn that scarf they have been years of misery and grief memory has no moment to look back to between the present and that happy day yet for such another moment of enthusiasm i would undergo all my miseries afresh i revert to it as this arab in the midst of the rising sands turns to his visions of the green speck upon the deserts sandy ocean j amidst dangers that is his hope in anguish that is his refuge that moment seemed to bestow upon me the happiness which my fancy had so long pictured in the future but every moment since has only served to weave closer round me the meshes of that net which has shut me out from joy i then however felt as if time no longer weighed upon me and i was grieved when arriving at my fathers door i found that the joys of hours had passed as those of a minute i found my </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> my sister in tears berchtold with his grey locks hiding the hands covering his face hearing my footsteps niy aged father rose and taking me in his arms with tears in his eyes he told me that he could no longer take upon himself to hinder me from joining my countrymen in the sacred cause of independence he bade me take leave of my sister and while my courage remained to surmount the pangof bidding her farewell tie told me that he had caused my sister to prepare every thing for a parting which he feared was to be our list he embraced me and rushed out of the house my sisterseyes wet1 with tears flow turned upon me atiiious to show the same resolution as my father had displayed she hastened my departure she gave me my gun and powder flask bound round my waist more than half the savings of berchtold and kissing me bade me fhrewell bewildered by the rapidity of my different emotions i hurried to the side of the lake looked once more up the steep mountain on the ascent of which beatenberg raised its white cottages and turning the point of land which encroached upon the lake i was soon wafted in company with many others towards the town of thun 1 did not heed the white sails hurrying along the blue rippling waves 1 could not gaze upon the rich cultivated scenery qf the lake my mind was straying midst those wild glaciers that once had been my horror which today had shewn me the unknown why does fate cause the ap> proaches qf misery to be decked with all the show of promised happiness from this moment begins my eventful history till now i had only been in the hands of the foul fiends that have tormented me as plastic clay which they formed in that manner best fittedto contain the miseries they were preparingto pour upon it you may think i have rested too much upon my early years which passed without action but those years saw deposited in my breast the seeds which have brought me to the state of apathy and misery you witness tnat vision has proved to me the harbinger of more woes than it promised pleasures and that scarf which you see is yet bound round my heart has felt it beat moreviolendy through anguish than it did even through hope at the moment it first encircled my arm my life till now had passed in dreams i had not known the rude blast of worldly interests i had been unconscious of the activity of the bad passions and had only viewed man in the shape of </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> of my fosterfather breaking by his presence the shackles of grief that restrained the energies of his children as the sun destroys the icy bonds that bind the vital powers of the spring in the cause of charity and virtue i had seen employed those powers and that activity which exerted in a less degree have often excited the admiration of the multitude and concealed follies nay crimes from even the philosopher in that halo of fame they bring around them the earliest impression i received were those from my fostermothers tales and they have not left me even at present how much less when but entering on manhood i had so often gazed upon my mothers picture which my sister wore round her neck from her earliest infancy that while sitting by her tomb it seemed as if her image had haunted me in my sleep for i frequently found myself arguing as if i had had actual proof of the existence of beings superior to ourselves the evening had closed before i arrived at thun the town was crowded with the peasantry of the neighbouring mountains there were fires throughout the streets around which stood the aged and the boy the mother and the virgin they were all come to offer their arms in defence of their country i approached the townhouse the door was crowdedi with petitioners who were attempting to induce the sentinel to give them precedence in the enrolment of their names i stood for some time watching the earnestness with which the aged laid hold of their very weakness and uselessness as a reason why they should be preferred in the cause of death while the young elate with the hopes of youth showing their sinewy limbs appealed to their expectations of victory from their strength as a reason why they should first be put upon the lists for battle their arms were more various than their ages an iron wedge sharpened and fastened to the end of a stick served some as the substitute for a hatchet burnt stakes and the chamois hunters rifle mingled with the scythe rounded into a sabre and the sickle straightened to a sword while thus silently gazing upon the scene a magistrate a friend of berchtold going to his post recognized me and approaching led me through a private entrance into the council chamber my proffered services were immediately accepted and i was directly ordered to put myself at the head of those villagers who could be found in the town belonging to berchtolds parish avoiding however as much as possible the burthening myself with the infirm and women i received orders to reach berne in the shortest </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> shortest possible time and to depart with the earliest dawn i went out into the streets a great part of the peasants had retired under the arcades which are on each side of the streets of thun they there formed one promiscuous mass in which it was impossible to distinguish between man and woman all was silent save the dead sound of heavy footsteps and the hoarse voice of individuals like mysel treading amidst these sleepers and calling out the name of that place whose inhabitants they sought the night was damp and dark there was no light in the heavens and often as i went 1 stumbled over the body of some unseen person who uttering a note of impatience again turned himself to sleep imitating the example of the others i called out the name of beatenberg at every step and soon mustered almost the whole population of berchtolds parish i had a painful task the old pointed to their children and with tears in their aged eyes asked me if 1 intended to hinder them from setting the example to their children of dying for their native soil the women pointing to their lovers would take no refusal they seemed determined to witness their conduct on the day of battle and see if they were worthy of the love they claimed i spoke i had in vain attempted to dissuade the old and the women from joining us they were all with us at the appointed hour i again as fruitlessly endeavoured to show them the embarrassment they would prove to our march they would not listen and i gave orders for the men to proceed in consequence of the exercise the peasants had been accustomed to in their native villages i found nodifficulty in forming them into something like a regular body towards night as i had purposely pressed the march throughout the day i was glad to perceive that the number of the old and infirm had much diminished next morning i again proceeded j it was with great difficulty that i could restrain myself and comrades from stopping to assist the women and old men who fell by the roadside through actual weakness and fatigue their cries imploring assistance from lovers from sons were heartrending i shut my ears and dared not listen the nearer i approached berne the more deserted i found the country all had flocked to the town or to the posts of danger at last with a body of two hundred men not even yet entirely deserted by the women i entered the capital i read dismay and horror upon every face even the peasantry which here as at thun crowded </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> crowded the streets were silent there were no signs of enthusiasm but the glance of suspicion fell from every eye just as we were approaching the great place we met a party of soldiers with their bayonets wet with blood they seemed with hasty steps to be hurrying/ from a spot that brought something horrible to their mind they did not speak but we soon learnt that they were the murderers of stetter and ryhiner they washed the blood of their countrymen from their weapons in the blood of their invaders and at last bathed them with their own posterity may then spare their names the brand of infamy for a momentary fit of rage against those they imagined traitors to their country we were ordered immediately upon our arrival to reinforce the army at frauenbrunnen and were joined upon our departure by other militias and by the venerable steiguer who had just thrown up the insignia of civil office in the deter mination of dying for his country we arrived at a critical moment the french having an advantage in cavalry and artillery which the swiss could not resist were upon the point of surrounding the small army the only impediment in their road to berne steiguer immediately per ceived the danger ordering us to follow he rushed forwards and attacked the troops which having already passed the right flank of general derlach were upon the point of gaining the road on his rear the combat was obstinate our chief attack was upon the artillery with which the enemy was attempting to cross the road our women did not shrink they rushed forward threw themselves upon the wheels of the guns and allowed themselves to be hewn to pieces ere they would quit their hold the army under derlach had in the meantime began its retreat to grauholtz we found ourselves surrounded and engaged amidst the very carriages of our enemys guns which we had taken by great exertions at last we formed ourselves again into a compact body and suddenly as if by one impulse tailing upon our knees we offered a prayer to the god of battle the enemy thinking we were about to throw down our arms checked themselves for a moment we arose the officers placed then selves at the head of the column whichset up aloudshout ran uponthefoe and bearing all opposition downsoon reached urteren where we made a momentary stand and then reached grauholtz the troops were immediately employed in raising an abbatis in front while the men were thus engaged erlach and steiguer met at the instigation of the latter the general came forward and thanked my troop for the intrepidity it had </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> had shown during the whole combat i was particularly noticed by them and received from the aged general a medal he wore round his neck as a token of his countrys gratitude i have seen he said the sun rise today upon freemen i shall not see it set upon my countrymen our country is lost it cannot thank its sons let me therefore who have directed its last efforts for freedom acknowledge the few hours respite you have obtained to its fate by presenting you with this mark of honour which i obtained from a free nation the loud roar of cannon burst upon our ears he left me i stood for a moment still in one hand i held the medal with the other i pressed the scarf of my unknown friend closer to my heart again we fought but again their numbers enabled them to turn our flank and in spite of the strength of our position we were obliged to retreat one more struggle at the gates of berne and all was lost the slaughter was horrible determined to sell my life as dear as i could i rushed into the thickest of the fight but my peasants followed me j they snatched me from danger and bore me struggling through the town i reproached them with having deprived me of an honourable death one approached with aged steps looking me in the face he merely mentioned the name of berchtold i understood him and leaving berne we turned our steps towards thun unfortunately the slaughter by the enemys sword was not the only horror that attended the dispersion of our troops the peasants and soldiers never in their legendary tales having heard of a defeat accompanied by a retreat on their native soil imputed the whole to the treachery of their officers the french had from the very beginning spread papers to this purport amongst them as we pro ceeded we therefore found the bodies of many of their officers hacked to pieces by the infuriate stragglers upon our arrival at musingen we found general derlfch in the hands of some of these men who had determined to convey him to berne with him was his wife who had accompanied him in his flight and a young officer whom i had remarked earnestly engaged in looking at my scar at the moment 1 was receiving the generals thanks at grauholtz 1 remonstrated with the spldiers but in vain i gradually however contrived to approach the general and when i thought myself sufficiently near to shield him drawing my sword i called upon the beatenbergers to assist me and instantly attacked them the young officer possessing himself </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> himself in the struggle of a sword was soon by my side the peasants joined us we drove the soldiers through the village but in the meanwhile some stragglers issued from the houses and striking the defence less old man with their hatchets left him for dead in the arms of his wife when i returned i found him apparently reviving through her care it was only for a moment he could not speak it appeared however as if he recognised me for he pressed my hand and turned his closing eyes first on his wife then towards me thinking he recommended her to my care i promised that i would protect her to the utmost of my power his eye glistened and he expired at this moment i again heard the cries of the soldiers as there was an unfrequented path over the mountains from this place towards hoestetten whence the young officer might easily get to lucerne 1 advised him to pursue it and get immediately out of the canton of berne we parted gathering my peasants together i directly set off with madame erlach in the cart towards thun she did not shriek or weep she seemed stupified by the greatness of her loss and when arrived at the city she without difficulty allowed herself to be taken from the body and to be conveyed in a boat to berchtolds whence she retired in a short time to complete solitude where she saw no one and soon after died i cannot paint to you the joy of berchtold when he once more held me within his arms my sisters tears flowed now as profusely as at our parting but from a different cause i had only been away a few days yet the crowded events that took place in that short period made it appear as many weeks the first spot i sought with my sister was my mothers grave there i sat with her silently engaged in thought after some time we began to converse and as i had nothing hidden from her i soon told the whole of my history from the morning of that day on which i had seen the unknown she seemed disturbed and upon my pressing her to explain to me whatpassed in her breast she advised me to beware for that it was probably one of the spirits of the jungfraus eternal frosts that had accosted me i laughed at what i deemed her folly but i soon perceived that there was something more on her mind than she was willing to confess in vain i besought her to disclose it to me she told me she durst not and asked </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> asked me as a favour not to speak to her any more on this subject alarmed i knew not why i looked at her with earnest attention she could no longer bear it but throwing herself into my arms informed me that while i was away she had seen our mother who had appeared to her arrayed in mourning announcing that iwas in the greatest danger and that she must guard me but that unless she wished to share my peril she must conceal it from me ernestus my sister said i cannot obey let your fate be mine and 1 am content saying this she again pressed me to her boson and wept i was moved i sat down by her side bound in each others arms we gazed upon the green sod in silence unwilling to disturb those thoughts which we know muslj be the same in the breasts of both anxious to learn some tidings concerning the fate of my native country i went every day to thun my indignation was excited by the recital of the cruelties and extortions of the french and when they dared to attempt disarming the inhabitants determined not to submit to so base au insult 1 was proscribed and sought refuge amongst those mountains which bad been the scenes of my prowess in the chase i went and sat whole days by the rocks in the wengern alp where i first saw that form which has since engrossed the whole of my thoughts i made enquiries at lauterbrunnen concerning the two strangers but ineflc tuallyj they had merely been there as other travellers to view the sublime scenery of the mountains and had not been heard of since i remained a whole month amidst these rocks only going to beatenberg at night when berchtold and my sister would receive me and supply ing me with provisions for the ensuing days tell me of all the insults that added to the shame of switzerland but at last they showed me the proclamation of schwarenberg against the six eastern cantons i immediately announced my determination to join them berchtold said nothing my sister followed me out of the house and begged to be permitted to accompany me i refused and upon her reminding me of her dream told her that as it promised she should share my peril it would prove impossible for me to go into any real dapger without her that therefore she need not follow me or if the fates decreed it we should meet at that moment without any endeavours on sent to aid the valisians in their attempt it was a hazardous undertaking we had to cross upon the </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> the flanks of the enemy and should be obliged it was supposed to pass through the grimsel which was in the possession of the french when it was proposed no one was found to volunteer no underwalder would leave his home in the hour of danger i had however re marked a number of schweitzers who had joined us singly having left theif dwellings though not countenanced hy their countrymen who were ranged on the other side to partake in the dangers of the patriotic underwalders to these men we applied and in a short time two hundred men were selected we kept almost upon the summit of the high ridge that joins the furca from the lake of lucerne and crossing the glaciers by rocks that even in the chase of the chamois would have startled me we arrived at realp and soon crossed into the valais at obergestela we learnt that some french troops had that very night crossed from the grimsel while the whole body of peasants were engaged in the lower part of the valley amidst the fastnesses attempting to stop that force which was advancing by the bridge of hochflue they had committed great outrages and had caused those who were able to fly behind the glaciers of the rhone our undertaking now seemed desperate the number of the french in the rear of our allies was greater than ours and the end of the valais through which we were to advance was flat and open without any shelter surrounded by steep mountains olivieri was however before me we had each one hundred chosen men and he seemed resolved on advancing not knowing how to procure intelligence of the enemy i immediately offered to advance by myself and reconnoitre as i well knew every part of this valley i was certainly the fittest person in our body for such an under taking but my companion would not hear of ceding the post of danger to me we were obliged to draw lots and it fell upon him and he departed in the mean time the women hearing of our arrival came from their fastnesses and joined us they seized upon every thing which offered the semblance of a weapon and resolved to follow us as my companion did not return as soon as i expected fearful of a surprise i determined to advance and if possible gain some of the passes before the enemy knew of our arrival i however previously sent forward a young woman to see if she could obtain any intelligence of olivieri i then ordered the men to follow in silence and marching all the evening we at last towards night reached </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> reached the village of blizingen where the valley straightens and becomes more inclosed and rocky the river here runs through a deeplycut channel more resembling a ravine than a common bed as i knew there was but one path and that very steep and dangerous i ordered my men to rest upon their arms while i went along the rivers channel to learn something concerning the enemy who i thought could not have advanced much farther at last being arrived opposite the village of vietsch i heard a great noise and saw many lights making no doubt but that these proceeded from the point where the enemy was stationed i returned i found my men asleep arousing them i ascended at their head the steep sides of the mountain and making them march parallel with the path but much higher i brought them above the village and hid them in a wood of pines that stretches along the steep i now no longer feared the superior numbers of the enemy the ascent was so precipitous that we could not be attacked except to great disadvantage while we could either join the valisians or fall upon the foe with every prospect of victory i determined once more to go and discover their exact position giving the word that if i thought it a fit moment for an attack i would fire my gun and then sound my hunting horn so that no mis take could occur from the firing ofany drunken soldiers or guard wrapt up in my mantle i descended from the wood and found the men lying securely asleep in the road between the houses they were certainly all there anxious to know something concerning my companion i resolved in spite of the risk to awaken some straggler and learn from him if any prisoner was amongst them iaccordingly approachedone who stretched along the edge of a precipice over the river wassunk in a sleep that seemed that of the innocent putting my pistol to his breast i awoke him alarmed he was upon the point of calliiig out when i threatened him with instant death to my inquiries he answered that a person had been surprized by some stragglers in the course of the day and he added that he was then lying bound in a cottage in the very centre of the village destined to be in the morning a but for their muskets it did not appear that his having been found armed had excited suspicion as he wastaken for a common peasant deter mined to save olivieri i knew not what ta do with this sleeper to shoot him would alarm the enemy they might immediate </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> immediate ly dispatch my friend and yet i could not leave this man to raise his comrades 1 pushed him down the precipice and directly entered the village all were asleep i found the cottage there was a light in the window 1 stole close to it wrapping myself up in my mantle i looked in you may imagine my alarm when i saw two soldiers awake in conversation while my friend upon his back was bound toa bench fastened to the floor there were several soldiers at my ffeet with their arms by their sides a sodden thought struck me i seized one of their guns and firing it i instantly re> treated to the other side of the cottage where i had remarked a window close to the fatal bench as i expected the two soldiers went out to inquire about the report which they had heard 1 took advantage of the few moments leapt into the rootft by the windowroused olivieri who gazed upon me expecting death i made a sign for silence cut his bonds and was again out of the cottage with my companion when i heard the door open to admit the two soldiers we hastened up the ascent and when amidst the rocks i fired my own fowling piece and blew a national air upon my horn before the enemy alarmed by the two soldiers who missed their prisoner could form we were amongst them and morn had hardly dawned before we had cut to pieces the whole of this detachment i could have induced the men to give quarter but the women were outrageous they followed our soldiers and dispatched the wounded whom their more merciful companions had spared while they excited the schweitzers to slaughter even those who threw up their arms none were saved the valisians who were making head against this body hearing the report of so many guns did not know what to believe they however approached and when they heard the swiss war cry of liberty they immediately joined us their joy cannot be expressed by words olivieri and my self had in the mean time met and his thanks were profuse but what was my sorrow to find that the young woman had been seized and bayoneted in cold blood because she would not acknowledge the right of the french to a superiority over her nation she had pretended not to know my companion and thus avoided betraying us by not being confronted with him we had gained a victory but it only served to delay the subjection of this noble peasantry they were obliged to come at last to a capitulation we could not be included </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> included in it the french asserted that the schweitzers were deserters we therefore determined to attempt once more a passage over the most unfrequented alps to a void the grimsel where the french might pass to interrupt our passage we crossed at once into the valley of formazza hidden in the day amidst the woods or upon the tops of precipices my few companions for our numbers had been greatly diminished journeyed in the night by a circuitous route into the vadi bedretto and thence over the st gothard by the path we had come towards the valley of stantz we had there expected to find our farmer companions yet struggling for life if not for victory we entered the valley there was no living creature to be found there was a silence unbroken by any sound of human labour the hoarse ravens fluttered above us as if they thought we also came to spread their banquet we could find no one to guide us no one even to tell us of our misfortune our imaginations pictured sufficient the villages were burnt the cattle lay slaughtered on the field it seemed as if death with one sweep of his scythe had cut oftthe lifeof all creeping along the sides of the mountains we approached stantz we expected to find the destroyers there butwhen we were in sight there was no town appearing we found but sixteen straggling houses yet standing all the rest were burnt these also bore the frenchmens mark they were billetted we looked at one another in silence the birds of prey were not disturbed by our presence they continued feeding on the dead while walking amidst these ruins i at last heard the sound of a voice it was the cry of sorrow a mother had found words to call on heaven for strength to bear her individual grief heedless of her countrys death i saw her amidst these ruins her hands were tearing up the soil to give the last refuge her country could afford to her child a grave she did not at first perceive me when die did her hand worked doubly quick while with her eyes fixed upon the corpse her hurried lips uttered mhold your hand hold your hand for a moment i shall soon be ready to follow i dug her sons grave and left her striking the sod as if she repented of having resigned the body to the earth we assembled our few remaining cook panions olivieri mid myself addressed thfem we advised them to separate and seek singly a refuge in their homes while yet speaking one of them brought before us a man who seemed to have </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> have risen from the grave his grey locks thinly scattered on his head were entangled his eyes were sunk so deep within their sockets that their lustre seemed the last glimmering of life before it sinks he had sought death from the fees and they in mockery had bade him kve they had fastened him to a table in the open air with several days provision within his reach and had placed before his sight the corpses of his aged wife his children and grandchildren all mark ed with the wanton infliction of their bar barous cruelty not even excelled by the voracity of the vulture or beasts of prey this wretched being told us that the schweitzers had troops placed the whole length of the other side of the lake to binder the fugitives from this valley escaping upon this intelligence our men became dejected the thoughts of dying ingloriously by the hands of their treacherous countrymen weighed upon their mind they spoke some time amongst themselves and then begged of us not to desert them assuring us that if we enabled them to reach the upper part of schweitz unbroken they then could disperse to their families without danger we could not refuse them we ordered them to go along the shore and see if they could find any boats they soon got together more than enough to convey us over but they had been observed by an individual who had immediately put off in his skiff and crossed to the other side this rendered greater caution necessary as he would undoubtedly inform the enemy of our/neighbourhood we offered to take the old man with us he refused determined not even in ruin to desert those spots which had seen his birth and infancy and manhood he returned to the bodies of his children threw himself upon them apparently resolved to breathe his last sigh in de fending these mangled remnants from further insult all that we could do was to lay a fresh stock of provisions by his side hoping to find the enemy unprepared upon some point or other we immediately entered our boats they however watch d as and at tie moment of our landing appeared before us in a body so numerous that it seemed impossible to escape we formed our men in the very water intoa wedge and taking a gun and bayonet ourselves we led them against the foes determined either to cut our way through or to fall upon the field of battle after repeated charges we at last succeeded but our numbers were reduced to fifty and several were wounded we mustered upon the very spot where the liberty of switzerland </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> switzerland had been sworn to by the three patriots it was the valley of brunnen fortunately the schweitzers did not pursue us travelling night and day we at last gained the higher parte of the canton whence my companions came we separated and it was a proud moment when they brought their wives and children to thank us as the preservers of their husbands and fathers olivieri and myself were now alone amongst the mountains as arewardwasset upon our heads and as we here depended entirely upon the fidelity of many who had shunned our cause we determined to depart and seek some other refuge my friend knew not where to go being ignorant as he said where bis family was he having left it privately while travelling to join the swiss he however determined to go into the austrian dominions and there seek for information we parted with mutual protestations of friendship and a promise from him of letting me know by means of berchtold when he had found safety we had had little communication i therefore scarcely knew more than that olivieri was not his family name and that he was an italian i had often remarked his eyes to be fixed upon my scarf but his delicacy preventing him from speaking upon a subject he perceived i was not willing to converse on was the cause of our parting without further communication he was indeed the brother of that object wind had never deserted my thoughts which sleeping and waking my lips had often called upon no night passed though dangers surrounded me on every side without her image rising to cheer for a moment my wearied heart bnt the dreams always ended unhappily it seemed as if the fates were determined to embitter oven those moments in which i was engaged in a noble cause thus to prepare my mind for those pangs which follow gink you may think i rest too much upon these instants of my life but i dread to narrate my miseries the recalling to memory anguish and grief racks my heart but i have begun and you shall hear the whole knowing the country well and being acquainted with every pass i found no difficulty in reaching the neighbourhood of beatenberg and i was soon locked in my sisters arms berchtoldand julias anxiety about me had been great they had beard by report of my being in imbued with the tales of our fostermother not to attach some credit to them my sisters dreams in which our mother visited her my own which always portended misfortune had enforced upon our minds the belief of the interference of superior beings for severalnights i </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> i returned but berchtold was yet as we imagined at thun my sister and myself left entirely to ourselves again talked over the feats of olivieri and she often asked me to repeat them seeming with pleasure to rest upon every circumstance regarding him foolishly i also took a pleasure in relating them for though we had been constantly rivals there was a frankness a heedless daring about him that excited admiration at the same time that the warmth of his expressions called forth a reciprocal feeling of love i knew not then how to discover the sting protruding from the rich scales of the snake we conversed upon our mother and my enquiries were numerous about her person her voice i cannot explain it but i wished even from julias dreams to aid the representation 1 had formed from her portrait of a being who seemed even after life to feel an interest in my fate in the locket there was a melancholy look about her dark blue eyes that was rendered heavenly by the soft smile playing upon her open tip i bad gazed upon it so often that i had her image before me even when far from home but it was only distinct in the face which appeared to be gazing on heaven with the consciousness of having obtained a prayer for me since my sisters dreams it seemed as if i knew a mothers care and i often sighed to think that though thus thoughtful of me even in heaven she did not think me worthy of enjoying her smile one morning i left my sister and retired to the wild borders of the brientz lake the sun rose and with its glitter ingray painted on the water the reflect ed images of the wild rocks upon the other side there is a point which juts into the lake and on it are the ruins of an old church i did not feel inclined to exert myself to reach a more distant spot but i laid myself down by an arching gateway round which the ivy clustered as if by its tenacious grasp it would hold together the monuments of another age upon which the breath of time was acting with a destructive power unheeded by man i seemed to feel this breath of time acting upon me as upon these works of man the wild joys of youth seemed sunk into the melancholy uniform feeling attendant upon age when all joy is passed all hope extinguished by the consciousness of the presence of death i gazed upon the mists as they rolled slowly along thehills veiling successively the various beauties of the banks and watched </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> watched the clouds shadow depriving the lake of its glittering sheen i rested upon their passing powers but did not notice that the glow of of the bright sun invariably returned upon the spots before darkened by a shadow the peasants barge and the light skiff passed rapidly before me but unheeded they passed in silence for it appeared as if even they sympathized in my grief it was midday i rose to shelter myself from the suns ray and sought that side ofthe point towards interlaken there was a small light skiff upon the water and in it was a female figure it was at some distance it gradually approached my heart flutttered my breathing became difficult my eyes were fixed upon a form i seemed to recognise her face wasnot lit up as i had seen it by all the fire of her indignant eye carried along by her small latin sail she approached her eye was gazing upon the rippling wave cut by her prow it seemed as if joy did not dwell there her eyelash veiledits splendour while her black locks curling on the breeze floated playfully around her breast at times would heave as if the sor row in her bosom was loath to grieve her but she seemed unwilling it should go for she rested upon it i stood intently gazing it seemed as if my least motion would have at once destroyed an illusion the current brought her heedless dose to the shore and the boat struck the bank she looked around and saw me it was plain die recognised me for her eyes fixed upon her scarf to paint to you the varying expressions of that eye and the varied colour of that cheek is impossible with slow hesitating steps she approached our eyes did not dare to meet and i stood by her for some moments in silence at last with a trembling voice she asked me if my name were not ernestus berchtold if you own that name fly instantly you have been betrayed and the bloodsuckers are already at interlaken upon their way to berchtold do not go there tonight i could hardly acknowledge my name i was so moved by her voice she offered to convey me to the other ride of the lake if i thought myself safer there unconscious of what i was doing i entered her boat and taking the oars tried by violent exertions to rouse myself we did not speak when upon the other side i landed farewell fell from her lips and it seemed as if the echoes mocking me repeated farewell i stood still watching her as entering the current of the </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> the aar she was gradually borne down towards interlaken even when she had passed the bridge i gazed and seemed to see a white speck that i imagined was her i turned away and towards evening found myself upon the same spot on which i had first seen her again she had appeared at first she had guided me into the path of honour this day she ensured my safety was she then a vision i asked myself was it my guardian angel who invested that form i did not think of pursuing my route to any place of greater safety it seemed as if this spot where my protector had appeared was secure i laid me down beneath the rock that1 had witnessed her presence and of fering up a prayer to heaven i gave way to all the visions my imagination offered she had recognised me she knew my name my rank and still felt an interest in my safety if you have ever known what it is to be in love you may judge what my feelings were if not my words are useless i hardly slept the whole night next day i roamed restless over the alpine heights around i did not heed the horrors or the beauties of these solitudes the cataract fell by my side and yet i heard it not wherever the valley wound thither i followed but as evening threw its stillness over nature ere the light canopy of heaven was darkened i found myself upon the covered bridge of interlaken i had forgotten my danger the open spaces between the beams supporting the roof enabled me to see the dif ferent houses which skirt the rivers side mine eyes however gazed upon that one in which i had heard the new inhabitants of this neighbourhood had taken up their abode i had imagined my unknown was the beautiful daughter i had heard of from my sister and i had not long been upon my station when i saw her come forth supporting upon her arm the feeble steps of the old man i had seen with her upon the wengern alp her eyes fixed upon his languid face seemed anxiously to be watching the features of her invalid fathef there was a bush not far from the door beneath the widespreading canopy of a lofty elm she placed him there and 1 saw reflected on heriace the smile which behmed upon the old mans as he gazed upon the setting sun i watched her slightest action her every glance it seemed as if her words soothed the pains of sickness and lightened the languor attendant upon an invalids inactivity oh if that </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> that smile had fallen upon myself as it then fell upon her father if i had only felt its cheering influence without that burning passion it has excited in this breast j but i must not anticipate ray narration the sun sunk behind the mountains she carefully shielded her sire from the damp i watched her retiring steps heard the door dose after her and at last turned away intending to depart again to some retired spot i was advancing when i perceived that there was some one at the end of the bridge apparently watching me and then retiring as if to look up the road alarmed i seized my hunting knife and approached him seeing me advance he came towards me it was the servant of berchtold he had seen me from a neighbouring height and an xious as he said for my safety had immediately followed me and finding me on the bridge had several times spoken to me without my pay ing the least attention perceiving at last how i was engaged in contemplating the beautiful object before me he had contented himself with guarding the entrance to the bridge i enquired about the french soldiers he turned pale but at that moment i hardly noticed it he told me that they had been watching berchtolds house during the whole of the night apparently aware of my being in the habit of going there every evening he informed me that there were only two remaining whom he had supplied so abundantly with wine that if i chose to venture towards the cottages he would inform berchtold and my sister where they could meet me while he engaged the attention of my pursuers how easily i was deceived i have since known the value of mens professions then i was young and confident in virtue berchtold and my sister met me but there were other soldiers in the neighbourhoodj those the servant led to a pass by which 1 must descend on my return it was but another instance of that venal boasted honour which so much stains the swiss patriotic history in the mean time i learnt from fierchtold that he bad walked to berne hoping to cause my sentence of outlawry to be cancelled that the french employers had lulled him with hope until he had been rash enough to acknowledge my being in this neighbourhood when they would listen to him no longer but sent the soldiers i have mentioned even ochs who had formerly been his schoolfellow had laughed when he reproached him for so vile a breach of confidence i spoke with my sister apart and informed her of my discovery she was </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> was surprised and seemed downcast but berchtold who had gone to listen and reported all silent joining us we could not proceed in our conversation i embraced them and had begun to descend the steep when i heard myself challenged having my gun with me i fired and the challenger fell but one leapt upon my back it was my own ser vant and i was surrounded i struck upon every side but it was in vain determined however to be revenged i threw myself upon the ground with the traitor as we turned i succeeded in getting him undermost and plunged my huntingknife up to the hilt in his chest he groaned and died i surrendered i was hurried to interlaken put into a boat and before the dawn of day was locked in the prisons of thun i expected to be immediately taken out and shot i was not however disturbed till night when i was awakened from a sound sleep and guarded by a company of soldiers was ordered to be conveyed to the castle of chillon upon the lake <rf geneva entering into conversation with the soldier who marched by my side i heard from him that berchtold and my sister had in vain applied for admission to my dungeon upon hearing of my misfortune that the reason i was removed at this late hour arose from the magistrates fearing a rescue by the people who once or twice in the day had seemed by their tumultuous meeting inclined to force the prison of him whom they called their only remaining patriot from him 1 first learnt that my name was in every mouth that there were romantic tales printed about me and spread over all the country in spite of the police which endeavoured so suppress them i did not feel any vain exultation at this i was too near death but i certainly experienced some satisfaction in the thought that for louisa r that that was her name for years locked up within my breast it has not passed my lips i have not dared to utter that name not even whisper it to my own ear but it has been deeply engraven here it is now a spell that conjures up horrid thoughts once it did not but i must command myself i had not visited this part of switzerland yet though beautiful and perhaps richer than pny i had seep it passed unobserved before my eyes the simple villagers hearing my name came round the inns at which we stopped and looked upon me in silence mothers brought their children to me to kiss as if my kiss could call down a blessing </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> blessing or inspire heroism i crossed the dent de jamanu and soon saw the castle once the prison of bonniva now destined to be my own the drawbridge was up and the sentinels were parading as if they esteemed the castle of importance upon my name being mentioned the bridge was lowered and i soon heard the clash of the chains employed in raising it after me it seemed to be accompanied by a voice that bade hope to leave me the rude stare of the soldiers and the bustling scene of the officers running to and fro did not tend to relieve the sorrow that weighed upon me i had dared danger in the chase upon the alps death in battle yet here the thoughts of leaving all oppressed me i did not think of the pain of parting with existence hut berchtold my sister the vision of the wengern alp all seemed to press upon my imagination with eyes that by their look seemed to denote a breaking heart my head fell upon my breast while with folded arms i walked along the vaulted passage i was searchedall was taken from me my knife the little money i had the rude jailor already had his hand upon the scarf retainining it with a firm grasp i looked at him and see ing his daughter close by his side if that child i said should be farfar from thee and thou couldst not hope to see her but in heaven couldst thou part with the only relic of her memory he looked upon his child and let go hie hold i was taken into a room where several officers were deliberating concerning me i had stood before them some time when one asked me my name ernestus berchtold was my answer it is the traitor j fell from the lips of one i looked upon him j he could not stand my glance but sunk into silence they were consider ing whether they should lead me to in stant execution or whether i should be confined till the pleasure of the govern ment at berne should be known as it was thought that they might wish to make a more public exhibition of the punish ment of him they so gratuitously called a traitor i was respited by one voice and was instantly ordered to my dungeon to descend into the prison which is below the level of the water it is neces sary to go down a narrow circular stair case while descending it we were stopped by that child upon whom i had rest ed my appeal to the jailor j to pass her we were obliged to </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> to go singly when i came close to her i felt something pressed into my hand while at the same time she made a sign with her finger for silence i put her present into my breast and fol lowed her father who was before me while the others were at my back i entered a long vault its floor was the solid rock and its high roof was supported by seven thick massy pillars the waves of the lake dashed sullenly against the walls above my head and the feeble light that pierced the high windows only showed me the damp black sides of this prison there were the steps of a prisoner marked during a long imprisonment upon the very rock i still heard the noise of bolts but did not heed it till i arrived at a narrow cell partitioned off from the greater dungeon which i had not perceived iu the general obscurity into this narrow space i was forced to enter it was not sufficiently long for me to lie down at full length and the barred grating which far above my reach was intended in mockery to represent a window received no reflected light from the dark floor of bonnivas prison 1 heard the doors fastened one after another beneath the slowly sounding wave i was cut off from humanity the mono tonous dashing against the castles base alone broke the dread silence it seemed like the loud note of the moments in natures last hour my spirits fled and i leant against the stones to which i was chained with hands clasped and my eyes painfully straining as if they sought at least to see the real horrors of my dwelling fatigued by my long journey over the steep jamanu i sought to sit and sleep but the damp floor for a long time kept my racking mind awake to all the torments of thought while it hoped for a momentary oblivion of woe at fast i sunk into repose and it was not until liate the next morning that i awoke but 1 awoke refreshed i had seen the constant attendant upon my dreams and isoon lost myself in thought upon her various appearances the waves above me seemed silenced to a calm and the suns powerful meridian ray reflected upon the various sides of the greater vault penetrated though in a feeble glimmer my solitary cell gradually stealing upon my ear i heard a distant voice which in melancholy notes seemed to sympathize with my sorrows1 listened it approached the measured strokes of an oar interrupted the heavenly strain y suddenly breaking into livelier notes it sung of hope the voice was </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> was they were italian words it was my visions voice it gradually sunk away into indistinct sounds i seemed another being hope breathed upon my heart and louisa wore the semblance of that enchanter j oh that i had died that she had left me to myself to die it was not the will of heaven again i heard the splashing sound of the oar and again that voice sounded on my ear j it was no longer the thrilling notes of an air but in slow recitative it bade me hope it told me that a boat should be stationed at two or three stone throws distance from the castle ready at all times to receive me if 1 could manage to get out and that in the mean time endeavours were making at berne to gain a repeal of the sentence passed upon me again the song of hope sounded in my cell losing itself gradually in the distance it at last left me with no thing human within hearing i now remembered the childs present feeling in my breast it proved to be a file and a knife i instantly began to work a the wall dividing me from the great dungeon while thus busily employed i heard the bolts of the vault withdrawn j my jailor entered he spoke not but threw me my pittance of bread and laid down my pitcher of watew hardly was he gone when i resumed my work the dampness of my ell aided me the mortar was sofo and the wall built of small stones/when therefore i had scrapped the mortar away from the crevices i did not find any difficulty in forcing them out ffoe by one i tore away many and l had already almost pierced the wall when fearful of penetrating entirely through lest the jailor might next day detect my attempt i managed to replace most of the rubbish iii its situation and to push the rest into a corner tnow began with my file to cut the chain that surrounded my waist the jailor caifie nexjt mornipg and told me that at the dawn of the ensuing day i was to be conveyed to berne this gave me additional strength the hopes of liberty of seeing louisa spurred me on and in a few moments i was free from my chains with what impatience 1 waited for the night it came 1 forced a passage through the wall and i found myself in the great vault without a manacle the moons ray seemed with a smile to seek the ground on which 1 trod for its cold beams pierced the grated apertur above and illumined some </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> some dreary spots 1 was not yet free the window was high above my reach but i did not despair taking the whole length of the dungeon to give m power i leapt and caught with my hands at one of the bars i raised myself and resting my knee upon the shelving sill i immediately began to employ my file and the rusty bars soon gave way to my arm i paused a moment the cool fresh air of the night no longer poisoned by the noxious vapours of the subterranean dungeon played amidst my hair f i seemed to inhale life the moons ray decked with one glittering streak of light the whole breadth of the wide lake it seemed the path of hope not far distant was a barge in three or four hours my murderers would be at my prison door the ground was covered with snow even to the waters edge i leapt into the lake and being a good swimmer i reached the boat numbed by the cold i had hardly the strength to raise myself into it there was no one to be found there were some coarse provisions a peasants habit and a letter j it had no direction if safe it said proceed to milan you will hear of us there your sister is well berchtold ill but do not go to him he knows we are attempting to save you and he shall immediately be informed of your escape the daughter of olivieris father/ it was now that i learnt that olivieri was the brother of louisa doni it was now explained why he so attentively examined my scarf i could not resolve on leaving switzerland without seeing berchtold there was a western breeze i hoisted the latin sail and in a few minutes i was free from immediate danger and on my way towards beatenberg it was necessary that 1 should keep amongst the mountains and i only dared approach the most solitary chalets they were generally deserted and it was with difficulty that i procured sufficient to support nature during the three days i was upon my way arriving at ceschi i took a boat from the side of the lake and crossing was soon at the foot of the steep on which stands beatenberg the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of voices chaunting which stealing down the mountain sunk upon the wave alarmed i knew not why i rushed up the path before the church porch around the great cross that stood upon the green sward knelt berchtolds parishioners arrayed in white though the red glare of the pine torch fell upon their faces </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> faces it did not allow me to distinguish any one breathless i stood incapable of motion the chaunt ended the minister of peace arose it was not berchtold hes dead i cried and rushed forward alarmed the peasants rose they recognized me and were silent my sister took my hand and bade me pray for him who had died incapable of any longer bearing the anxiety attendant upon my fate i knew not what i did i knelt i heard the solemn chaunt sing berchtolds requiem and could not join it the earth closed over him and the minister led me to my former home i was inconsolable they talked tome of ensuring my safety j i was deaf to theirremonstrances and only listened to grief my sister was left alone with me she wept with me and ere it was dawn had persuaded me to departr she told me that louisa had been with her had made her promise to join her in case of berchtolds death so that i need not be under any anxiety on her account she informed me that louisa had walked with her over my haunts had enquired after every minutest circumstance about me my sister said she thought she loved me i could listen to no more embracing her i issued forth visited my mothers and berchtolds grave and soon lost sight of beatenberg louisa loved met it was too true if that love had fallen upon any one else it would have proved a blessing on me you see my withered lineaments my sunken eye my feeble step think you a common curse could thus blast the bloom of life berchtold was but the first victim to my love my love has left me a scat tered pine amidst this desolate scene but first it has destroyed all who were bound to me my love has provedbut i must preserve my strengthlhave horrors to relategoing through the simplon then a road only passable by mules or on foot i soon arrived at milan i was in safety the city was in possession of the austrians i had hardly rested at the inn at which i took up my abode and was making enquiries in hopes of discovering the donis when olivieri entered we flew into one anothers arms he answered none of my enquiries but leading me to his carriage we arrived through the corso at a palace close to the gates we got out 1 knew not whither he was leading me the doors of the saloon were thrown open and i found myself in the presence of his father his sister the old man advanced and taking my hand which hung </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> hung by my side he thanked me for having twice saved the life of his son i knew not what to say j conscious i owed my life to louisas interference i could not find words to thank her the father at last led me towards his daughter and bade her attempt to thank me her eyes turned upon me suffused with blushes she had some words upon her lips when 1 forced myself to stop her jdo not mock me what do i owe to you my life is nothing when compared to that thirst of honour you inspired in my breast again she blushed and was silent at that moment another carriage arrived it was my sister attended by two faithful domestics of my friend locked in my arms she was at last taken thence to be clasped in those of my preserver after taking some refreshment the father led me into another room he there told me that berchtolds last request was that he should supply his place and take my sister and myself to him as his children as lie spoke he showed me at the same time the last lines which my fosterfather had written a few moments before he died they contained our history as far as he was acquainted with it in them he bade me trust always in god and recommended me to bow under that dispensation which had made me an outcast on my native soil and not to murmur at the will of him who had deprived me of the feeble support a swiss pastor could afford against the pressure of events since he had raised me up a protector so much more powerful in the father of him whose life i had saved doni took me by the hand and perceiving the tear trembling in my eye he begged of me to let him supply the place of berchtold he called me sonj louisas father could not call me so in vain i fell upon his neck but could not speak </chapter> <chapter>part second you have visited our alpine scenes and have undoubtedly been witness to the approach of one of those dreadful visitations of angry nature which sometimes occur in the pent up valleys the black speck gatheis upon the mountains brow amidst the silence and dead stillness of the air it seems as if all were resting in hopes of gaining strength to resist the desolating fury of the powers let loose against them only thelowingof the cattle which with its hollow lengthened sound seems to give unheeded notice of the dread storms approach echoes upon the air awed by the very stillness yet the sun shines brilliantly on </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> on the scene doubled in the unrippled surface of the lake that seems proudly to bear the beauteous image as if it were conscious how soon that smiling scene would be changed so passed the years in which day succeeded day in unperceived succession in which i lived under the same roof partook innocently of the same joys and sorrows as louisa there was yet a weight upon my heart i could not explain my dreams always terminated unhappily and sleep that refuge common to all misery was to me like the waking hours of others immediately after our arrival my sister was visited with a threatening appeal from our mother who bade her depart with me once more to our native wilds and never return we could not understand the decrees of fate lulled by the peace and apparent happiness mound us we were unconscious of what was in futurewe remainedand i am what you seea spectre amongst the living encouraged by louisa i again returned to my studies all the morning engaged in the library of my benefactor i followed them under his direction chiefly reading the modem poets and historians with whom 1 had little acquaintance louisa would often come and sitting by my side read the same passages and discuss the merits of a particular image often directing my taste and pointing out many beauties i had not before perceived even in my favorite authors you see those volumes they are those we read together they now form my whole library but you cannot know the pleasure there is contained in a single one of those pages i read them and every word again sounds upon my ear as if she spoke it i turn round and am undeceived louisa isnot by my side though her voice seems speaking as when we were innocent in the evening we assembled in the saloon of the palace doni was distinguished from his countrymen by a state of affluence which was apparently boundless but which was the more extraordinary in this respect that it did not excite the envy of his neighbours his riches indeed seemed less for his own use than for that of his friends he was of a noble family but being the offspring of a younger branch he had been early innured to hardships disdaining the mean idle life he was obliged to lead in subservience to the will of a proud relation he had left milan at an early age and had travelled into the east he never however spoke of his journey and always seemed anxious to direct the conversation into another channel whenever it turned upon subjects in any manner connected with it </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> it he had returned rich no one knew whence but there were whisperings abroad that he had not gained his riches by commerce j though no one could trace where his riches lay yet as his gold was poured forth with so liberal a hand his wealth was deemed almost infinite he had been strikingly handsome and was extremely intelligent but grief had weighed down his energies and sorrow had broken his faculties after his return he had married beauty was the mere casket the riches were within his wife was described as having possessed a mind that without laying aside all that appealing delicacy and weakness which binds woman to man had all those powers and accomplishments which unfortunately in her sex have generally been the panders to vice but which with her were the handmaids to virtue her presence was commanding but her voice was persuasive its tones struck the heart and produced those emotions which all remember none can express the feeling as if we had been always virtuous and were worthy of listening to the voice of a being superior to ourselves the poor followed her steps not with their usua boisterous cry for charity but in silence they seemed to watch the glance of her eye as if the sympathy which shone there had made them even forget their ragged miseries louisa was her court terpart when i heard any one describing what her mother had been it seemed that i could read the whole upon her daughters face and methought i could often perceive the speaker reading on the same page doni had loved her nay more had adored her butshe had married him by the persuasion of her parents while her heart was engaged to another far away he had returned they saw one another and fled together doni pursued them fired at the carriage which was escaping and blood fell upon the road they did not stop doni then entirely ost all command of himself he fell in the road calling for mercy and relief from that curse which had already begun to blast him he had never recovered the shock had retired from all those gaieties in which he had been once engaged and devoted himself to the education of his children for their sake he had however again entered into society but in a very different style from his former magnificence these are the circumstances which 1 heard of his history from those friends with whom i spoke in the course of the two first years of my stay at milan besides this i also found the reports of his supernatural powers to be believed and whenever i enquired concerning them </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> them the speaker always ipoked round the room before he ventured to speak and would then only answer in whispers i have mentioned our evening assembly in the saloon of the palace thither all distinguished by rank or science came all visitors were alike welcome there no ceremony which is but the vaiqpointing of selfishness to its sacrifices incommoded those who jnvitcd by the society they found there chose to take a chair in this circle louisas father always held the reins of conversation in his own hands and instead of letting it fall upon the common place subjects of fashion he turned the minds of his company to disquisitions that gave to each an opportunity of showing his information or judgement at times the existence and powers of the deity were canvassed at times the reality of beings intermediate between god and man their qualities and the facts related concerning them came under consideration other evenings heard discussions upon the nature of virtue whether it really were definite and felt as is beauty in every breast or whether it were not merely an object of policy and selfconvenience the father and son generally took opposite sides and under one or the other each individual of the company enlisted himself accordingly as it happened that he were either in a humour to be pleased with the ge neral dispensation of providence throughout the day to himself or was smarting under what he conceived to be an undeserved infliction of the evil spirit olivieri madeit a pointto bewilder every one he was a little older than myself his head though not perfect had much beauty a fine forehead black hair a dark though small eye united to a grecian contour formed if notapleasing a striking physiognomy 1 soon found that he had read much his body also had been exercised though not graceful he was active and hardly any excelled him in a certain quickness of adaptation both of mind and body to any thing required his opinions were paradoxical and singular in religion he outwardly professed catholicism and strongly opposed those scribbling philosophers who by sarcasm attempt to overturn the religioii of ages though at the same time he allowed the absurdity and falsehood of the prevailing doctrines this did not appear to arise from a spirit of opposition but if the motives he gave were true from a chain of thought that did honour to his heart not head he asserted that catholicism was the only religion affording to the poor and to the sick of heart a balm for their evils calvinism deism and atheism were by him called the professions of the northern nations cold as their native </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> native rocks professions to which enthusiasm and the feeling of a certain refuge so heartsoothing in catholicism were unknown he maintained that it was not for individuals who had the advantage of education and imagination to shelter them from the overwhelming force of mental miseries and unlooked for importunes to attempt under a real thougftvain pretence of the love of truth to deprive the poor and uneducated millions forming the mass of mankind of the consolation always offered by this religion which instead of shunning the poor gladly seeks their miserable hovel in the hope of administering present comfort and future hope indeed he was inconsistent in his principles he had not mingled much in general life but while at padua where he had been sent to study he had sought the acquaintance of all from the knowledge of man he had there acquired whether it were that he had constantly met with mean and weak companions or that conscious of his own bad qualities he had thence estimatedthe value of mans professions he always seemed to view the human character in a darker hue than was warranted by truth and to have formed his mind into a general contempt for mankindasamass and a deter mination if ever an occasion offered of rising at their expence considering them but as tools to work with his manners were at first always engaging and rather pleasing but this seemed irksome to him and he gave way to an imperious assuming air in conversation which soon disgusted his friends his ideas of a life after death seemed strangely childish he did not believe in an immortality yet he had so strong a love of fame that there was no reputation he did not covet he sometimes formed visions of a throne raised upon the blood of his countrymen spilt in civil war at times of the fame of a benefactor to debtors and galley slaves he sought at the same time for the applause of the philosophers and the drunkard the divine and thifc libertine things of which even at the moment of action he was ashamed were often done by him in the view of proving himself capable of excelling even in vice it was hard to say whether he owed a certain frankness and easiness of attachment to his weakness or to seeds sown in his breast by nature but whether it were from his incapability of constantly acting up to his system or to the overpowering force of nature it was strange to hear him express himself a follower of a doctrine that has proved the leech of human blood and at the same time refuse to tread upon a worm </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> worm the evil was his riches induced the young to pander for him the old to flatter him on account of his specious talents and handsome appearance he was a student a gambler and a libertine this man became my companion his father often pointed me out to him as the model for his conduct and when he had to reproach him for the losses at the ridotto or when olivieri sought an excuse in the plea of youth for the ruin his libertinism had brought on many families he would speak of me as an example of strength resisting all the temptations of vice i was a reed when the storm came olivieri had watched me at the meetings in the saloon 1 was generally a mere listener but my curiosity was alive though silent my mind had an insatiable thirst for knowledge i was a catholic berchtold had educated me in doctrines without teaching me the foun dation upon which they were built j he thought it impiety to question them the conversation to which i was now present seemed to rest upon the entire conviction that all i believed was false yet this was not satisfactory i heard arguments adduced in support of one assertion which seemed irresistible but what was my surprise on another evening to hear the same person adduce more than plausibilities in favour of the contrary hypothesis i at last was bewildered i was unwilling to believe the human mind incapable of truth the more i examined the more difficulty i found in the attainment of it i heard the deist and theatheist contend following but one of the chains of argument i was convinced looking at them together 1 saw the lustre of truth equally on both i knew not which to choose i was a sceptic in fact notin name night after night upon my sleepless couch i called upon the god whose existence i doubted to visit me as if god heeded the belief of an individual as if the happiness of an infinite being like him depended on a mans faith in his existence olivieri perceived the state of my mind i asked his assistance he laughed at my attempt at knowledge and bewildered me still more i was restless and seemed at length to be deprived of all motive for action no superior being to smile upon our efforts to whom we may show our gratitude and whose approbation we may obtain no virtue but artificial trammels set up under its name to lure the unwary into the toils of the wittiest knave i wished i had never left those mountains amidst which i had thought i felt the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> the breath of a superior being though he was clothed by my imagination in terrors nothing above man and that man the sport of chance of his own caprice yet within my breast it seemed as if aspirings dwelt which secerned to have been born with me were they but a mockery i grew melancholy whole days confined to my room 1 meditated till my brain became a wilderness of various thoughts so en tangled i knew not how to extricate myself my sister fearing i was ill would often sit by me would bring louisa and they would together listen to my doubts julia seemed to be as much affected by them as myself she listened with avidity and echoed my own ideas not so louisa she talked of revelation of a beneficent deity who had for a while left man in ignorance to prove to him his own weakness but had at last revealed himself and announced a better state while she spoke she seemed like the first vision of the wengern alp destined again to save me and set me free from these bewilderings the first step towards vice she soothed my mind her lips quelled doubt into the peaceful certainty attendant upon christianity i no more paid any attention to the conversation of the evening but set myself down by louisa and listened to her while she was engaged in some work which though it employs the hands leaves the mind at liberty i sat by her asking for some errand some office in doing which i might do her bidding she was evidently gratified by my attentions she would blush at my approach and smile she would make room for hie by her side oftentimes 1 gazed in silence upon her and often our eyes met her breath at moments played upon my cheek and sometimes her hand by accident touched mine she would bid me read poetry to her and often love was the subject of the poets lay my voice trembled i dared not look upon her for fear she should perceive the emotion upon my face i loved her but it was not a common love 1 did not rest upon the hope of gaining her she appeared a being superior to myself of whom i was unworthy yet it seemed as if her smile were necessary to induce me to exert myself and was a reward sufficient for the greatest deeds she would sing to me she would walk with mein the garden j but you must imagine i cannot paint the charm the magic in her conversation i have not described her person for i could not her mind was more </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> more heavenly than her eye its expressions more delicately varying than the bloom on her cheek j there was meekness attendant upon power softness upon strength if she had not left me for a moment i might have been spared much guilt but the sickness of a near relation was a call she could not resist i hadoften followed her when masked she attended upon the sick in the hospitals it is an italian custom often have i disguised in the covering gown of the misericordia stood by her whom it was impossible not to recognize the dying called for her though they knew her not they soon distinguished her powerful tones which pierced through the bond of grief around the most withered heart and poured upon it those precions consolations afforded by her religion her manner her voice her gestures seemed at such moments to be those of a being who was conscious of the truth of what it announced not from the testimony of man but from having witnessed the presence of the very deity the loud groan the stifled sigh were silenced in her presence pain seemed to have no power conscience no sting she left me to visit her relation for some days i felt lost i knew not to whom to apply my sister seemed always occupied she spoke with me but i was sorry to find she had imbibed those doctrines so easily eradicated as i thought from my own mind i observed olivieri paid her particular attention and often conversed with her he at last perceived how restless i was j he seized the opportunity determined to gain an object which 1 did not think him capable of attempting during my stay at milan i had hardly ever been out in the evening for as it is not customary for unmarried females to go into society i should have lost the pleasure of sitting by louisa now i had no inducement to remain at home olivieri persuaded me to accompany him to the theatre of la scala i was induced by the splendour of the scenery the beautiful dancers the exquisite singing to return 1 was led into the boxes of our friends and behind the sdenes i found my companion wasevery where well received the dancers and actresses crowded around him their conversation was lively and various gradually the freedom in their discourse which had at first disgusted me grew indifferent then pleasing by the wit sometimes shown even upon such subjects one of these women to whom olivieri introduced me wasamistress in her art and well understood the artifices by which the young and unwary are misled she was beautiful and though </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> though her eye was never free from a certain look of confidence the characteristic of this class she could soften its expression and cause it in the presence of him she intended to inveigle to send forth such glances as it was impossible to resist by olivieris desire she attached herself to me and i gradually took plea sure in her company i saw her neglect the attentions of the first nobles in milan to gain mine in the midst of the rapturous applause of the whole theatre she would turn her eye upon me to see if i approved she seemed to sacrifice herself for me when the opera was over she would take my arm and lead me to the saloon of the theatre where all were engaged in gambling sitting at a window she drew me into conversation gradually she approached the table we at first stood merely as spectators at last she tempted me to try my fortune i consented laid down my stake it was soon increased to an enormous amount for i was successful i threw it into her lap and we parted for several nights i was equally fortunate but at length i lost i was so profusely supplied with money by the kind friend who called me son that i did not at first heed my losses had given all i gained to the syren who still urged me on i lost every franc i had she then supplied me i was ashamed to take it of her though it was what i myself had gained but i hoped my luck would change i lost the whole she then began to exert her more baneful powers she led me from folly to vice in search of what she assured me was an antidote to memory j i joined the libertine and the desperate 1 was ashamed of letting doni know that he whom he had pointed out as a model of virtue to his son had sunk into the lowest debauchery louisas image often often was before me but how dare i name her in conjunction with my vices she had thrice been a ministering angel guiding my steps but then i was innocent i dared not now rest upon the thought j and often i threw myself deeper into the sinks of vice in hopes that such reflections would not pursue me thither the syren instigated by olivieri led me into every excess while he plied me again with insinuations against religion and sneers upon my credulous conscience that pictured a future state i was now glad to seek refuge in unbelief j and i strove to lose myself in those thoughts </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> thoughts which i had before fled and from which i had been saved by my protecting angel he also excited me to gamble lent me money himself when i had none and gathered round me every incentive to vice he had been mortified at his fathers holding me up as a pattern of strength against temptation he was revenged he exposed my weakness i had hardly resisted the first approaches of vice and had in a short time sunk below the lowest frequenters of its haunts one night i was desperate every thing of value that i had was gone olivieri himself had been unsuccessful and i knew not where to seek for the money i wanted to satisfy my creditors i rushed out from the house and found myself in the piazza del duomo my brain was hot my hair dishevelled 1 rushed along not knowing what i was about i knew not where to apply to destroy at once donis opinion of my virtue by telling him my situation seemed worse than my present feeling i stood still holding my head with my hand i lifted my eyes from the ground on which they had been fixed it was night there was no light save from the glimmering stars and the newly risen moon upon the dark canopy of heaven the white facade of the duomo raised its huge mass in contrast with the night shining even upon its dark veil it seemed to awe the mind by its indistinct mass which weighing on the earth forced itself upon the eye when all else was lost in the shading darkness all was still and sunk to rest i alone seemed waking midst sleep in anguish midst repose i stood 1 know not why for some time gazing upon the marble statues and forms which gained a certain charm from the moons silvering light the mats spread like a curtain before the doors being raised by the dying breeze struck with a measured impulse thewall unconsciously i entered save where the light of the moon fell upon the heavy columns vesting them with the faint hues of the coloured glass that adorned the windows it was all darkness that seemed sensible to the touch i walked towards the high altar there is a subterranean chapel dedicated to st borromeo which receives its light through the flooring of the dome the silver lamps hung over the shrine sent up a columnof light to the very roof i descended the stairs and found myself within the chapel the lamps were almost failing and the silver walls darkened by the torch of the devotees absorbed the little light they emitted i approached the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> the shrine the dried corpse of the saint arrayed in his pontificals seemed by its repose to invite me to seek peace where he possessed it his eye which once might also have known anguish was now sunk in the socket and presented but a mass of blackened mould in the corner of its former throne i gazed upon it until thought i saw it move methought there was a smile upon its lips as if it mocked my thoughts of peace i repose with him a benefactor to the poor a saint a laugh was almost play ing upon my lips wjien the words half stifled with emotion intercede my patron intercede for berchtold sounded on my ear i turned a female figure i had not observed was kneeling near the wallin earnest prayer i approached who prays for berchtold your prayer is mock ed alarmed she raised her head it was you know whom i would say it was louisa she looked upon my face convulsed with the violence of my emotions upon my dishevelled hair is it you ernestus she said rising are you come to pray heaven has then heard even me and has not left you break pot my heart i could not utter more she took my arm we passed through the long nave i dared not look around methought some other form would burst upon my eyes in spite of the circling darkness and hlast me a carriage was waiting at a little distance she had left the gay dance to pray for me i had handed her into her carriage and was going berchtold she said will you leave me she wished me the wretch to be still near her i jumped into the carriage and blessed the darkness that hid my face we spoke no more every one had retired at donis she took my hand when leaving me and pressing it in hers whilst she gazed upon my face she bade me think she would have said more a tear fell from her unwilling eye and she hastily turned away i returned to my room i had not entered it for many days louisa knew my guilt sleep would not refresh me my thoughts revelled in a maddening breast whither could i turn for refuge from their power religion i had cast from me as a foul fiends mock louisa l rest upon purity i dared not then my native mountains rushed upon my sight i seemed boundingalongthe crags berchtold smiled upon my innocence i laughed aloudinnocence it was but the want of temptation i threw myself upon my bed and though not asleep ibecame so stupifiedby the very excess of </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> of pain that even the phantoms of conscience no longer passed with distinctness before me the night seemed to hang suspended over my head as if in pity it would hide me from the day so slow was its progress morning at last returned but with it were the same thoughts as had visited me during the night it was hardly day before i heard some one at my door i opened it it was doui i turned away my head ashamed to took upon him he did not reproach me telling me that he knew my present way of life needed a more abundant supply of money than he had given me he bade me to ap ply to him for any sum i wanted i could not speak 1 had expected he would have attempted to show me my vices in all their native horror he pressed his offer upon me ashamed to tell him the whole aipount of my folly i at last named a sum not half sufficient to satisfy my creditors but i thought it would stop the mouths of the most clamorous and that in the mean time by economizing my allowance i might clear the rest he asked me repeatedly if it was the entire sum i owed 1 answered yes he left me and in a few minutes returned with gold to the amount required takeit he said it is no loss to me but your wonted happiness i see is fled that grieves me believe one who is older than yourself vice is not the path of happiness i was silent i intended immediately to pay my debts as far as 1 could and at once to free myself from the life of a gambler and a libertine my sister came to see me in my room for i was ashamed of appearing at the breakfast table i observed that the colour in her cheeks was gone that she no longer was the openhearted girl i remembered attributing this however to the effect of my own follies upon her mind 1 said nothing she remained with me some time but i no longer felt that pleasure i had always known in her company upon former occasions we seemed both afraid of touching upon any thing relating to ourselves and both evidently with minds deeply occupied about other important objects talked of the most trivial circumstances when night came i issued forth determined to pay my debts as far as was in my power j i entered the saloon of the theatre there were only the banker and the punters arrived they had arranged every thing for the faro table and immediately they </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> they saw me they began talking of the various successes of the last night a they told me how olivieri had regained every thing at the very close of the evening one or two gradually stepped in amongst them was my friend he was in high spirits itook him aside and told him that i was weary of this kind of life and was determined to pay every one as far as i had itin my power he would not let me finish he laughed at my intentions and told me that as our good luck was now returned it would be a folly to throw it away that as i acknowledged myself incapable of paying die whole it would be as well to owe a greater as a lesser sum his companions soon perceived the subject of our conversation mid joined us they all ridiculed my intention and i was persuaded to venture once more i at first lost but suddenly the rouleaus poured upon me one more stake and 1 had regained even all my enormous losses it was soon too late to retire i almost lost all 1 had that morning received from doni it was now quite use less to think of retreating 1 fell again into my former life with more than double energy 1 was at times surprised to find that great sums were paid to several of my creditors i could not learn by whom i imagined it was by olivieris father this did not stop me my vicissitudes were great but i could never entirely extricate myself so that i wasalways either lured by hope or urged by despair i need not describe to you the progress of my other vices debauched women men of whom one is ashamed and wine are ge nerally the attendants upon gambling i could not seek the house of doni nor oaf virtue i threw myself into every haunt of desperate characters like myselfi and learnt to boast alike of the smile of the prostitute or of the tear of the debauch ed virgin when losing i stupified my mind with wine and was glad to fall from my chair provided memory failed with my senses noted cheats and men proscsh bed from society for their low dissolute ness often seized upon my arm on the corsoas if i were oneof their equals and i dared not repel their familiarity for i was in their power once louisa saw me in this situation she never again rode out on the corso i had the maddened impudence to bow to her i at last became mad and once was induced to aid in depriving a young novice of </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> of all his wealth by means of false dice i could not however stand by and see his horrible despair he had beggared a wife and two lovely babes i had just then been lucky i confessed my participation to him and gave him the whole amount of his loss it became known and i was laughed at but for once i could withstand ridicule at the doni palace in the mean time the same outward appearance was preserved there were still the same evening assemblies but they were less frequented for olivieri was almost always with me he was apparentlyafraid i should escape him he was constantly stifling all thoughts that arose in my breast tending towards a return to virtue he never left me but when i was deeply engaged in play or debauch then he constantly went i know not whither i have since found it out and that discovery has not been the least of those pangs my guilt has brought upon me i entered so little into society that i heard nothing of what was passing there i was however one day standing on the corso with olivieri speaking to some ladies who had drawn up their carriage close to a shop when the conversation turning upon the number of foreigners who were moving about in consequence of the peace which had just been concluded a lady turning asked me if i had seen the stranger who excited so much the curiosity of all circles upon my saying i had not she began expatiating upon his singular character rested upon his powers of fascination and told me that all the ladies were in love with him i did not pay much attention to this thinking it but the foolish prattle of a young girl she however continued she wondered that 1 had not seen him as he was a constant attendant upon louisa she having engrossed the whole of his attention much to the mortification of all milan now i was roused i let go olivieris arm and wandered about alone i dared not hope that louisa could resist one whom all seemed to admire the whole weight of my guilt fell heavily upon my recollection and one after another au my vices presented themselves arrayed against me i did not return that day to any of my usual haunts towards evening i found myself fatigued with wandering at the gate of the doni palace 1 know not what inspired me it seemed as if i wished to gain the certainty of my fate my steps which till now had been slow and measured suddenly quickened i found myself at the entrance of the saloon all </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> all was silent the red purple glare of sunset pierced the windows i stood for a moment still asigh burst upon my ear i entered louisa was sitting looking upon the setting sun it was her sigh she did not turn is it you my father i did not speak she turned her head her face was pale but a blush mantled her cheek at the sight of me her eyes were sunk and dim but they brightened at my presence she spoke my name she rose and with faultering steps attempted to reach a door leading to her apartments i murmured audibly but with a stifled voice she flies me she flies she hates me she turned oh no i do not ernestus do not believe it she fell upon the floor i approached knelt by her side but dared not touch her i attempted it my hand retreated there seemed to be pollution in my touch j i dared not the cool air played upon her face and the chill of the marble floor gradually recovered her j she opened her eyesj i was now near her 1 could see the marks of a suffering mind upon her face her cheek now had no colour save that reflected from the red light of the illumined west her tresses were disordered and neglected her eyes sunk deep in their socket how changed from the vision of the wengern alp her subdued voice could hardly articulate when she again assured me with earnestness that she did not hate me that she forgave me tears flowed down my cheeks and i did not try to stop them she looked upon me it is too late she said smiling with the smile of a broken heart it is too late berchtold i wish that i could weep but my eyes are dried up the sounds of approaching footsteps were heard she rose with difficulty trembling i offered my arm she took it i thought she would have spurned it i could hardly support my own weight i saw her to her door and threw myself upon staircase near it but 1 soon heard strange voices in the saloon the thought of its being his voice who i had heard was my rival at once made me start i rose retired for a moment to my room and then entered the apartment was now lit up the company were in greater numbers than i had ever seen before my rival 1 said to myselfi is then so attractive no one observed my entry they all seemed engaged around one man it was my rival i never saw so singular a figure his bust and </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> and head were handsome and bore the signs of strength his black hair was in ringlets his face was pale with a blueish tint that diminished even the colour of a naturally pale eye his hands were joined with their palms turned towards the ground his eyelids almost covered his eyes which turned upon the floor while his head erect bore in its general expression the marks of contempt he was speaking with elegance upon the fallen glories of some sunken nation when he had ended and the conversation had became more general he raised his eyes and affecting surprize he seemed ashamed of having attracted so much notice though he did not blush for the hue of his features seemed invariable he retreated to a corner of the room left vacant by the pressure of the company towards the spot he had just occupied he there bent down his head as if abstracted in thought but looking under his eyebrows he was evidently engaged in remarking the effect he had made upon the company he again gradually got a circle round him and again was apparently carried away by the great powers of his mind and held forth upon some subject and then once more retreated i was tired of watching such acting and looked round for my sister she was at that moment entering she immediately addressed doni who seemed alarmed and went out i approachedlouisa was ill and could not appear julia looked upon me as if she knew it had been my presence which had thus affected her friend 1 could not bear that look do not reproach me i feel all the shame of my crimes i reproach you she answered you mock me i it is not for one like me to do it she tnrned away i did not understand her i asked her why she rested upon one like her oh do not ask me my shame must not be spoken the noble stranger approached and broke off our conversation by asking after louisa 1 could not stand by him but joined some of my former acquaintances for though my heart was breaking i dared not leave the room determined to watch minutely every action of him i fancied my rival i entered into conversation and forced myself to enquire about this stranger who thus engaged the attention of all there was a certain affectation of mystery about him which induced all to seek him in hopes of penetrating the veil he threw round his actions i met with one who had known him intimately in his own country from whom i learnt several traits of his character it appeared that this german </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> german was much distinguished amongst his countrymen for his talents that he was generally esteemed a hater of all the vanities of the world but that he passed many hours at his toilette that he was deemed brokenhearted from having been crossed in love but that he was incapable of feeling that passion being wrapt in selfishness that made him sacrifice every thing around him to the whim of the moment that he was deemed irresistible and that no woman upon whom he fixed his eye could withstand the fascination of his tongue but that he had never dared to tempt any woman who was not of the most abandoned character that even they were never addressed with boldness but were always made to compromise themselves by some folly with him in public before he would give them the least marked sign of attention that in fine he was a confirmed coward with women in society he was playing off a strange coquetry with the whole world affecting to be modest and diffident whilst he protruded himself into notice he was however rich handsome and noble by birth i was an orphan dependant upon charity he was every where received with great attention no where with greater than in donis palace perceiving that louisas father did not return i became alarmed and anxious to gain some information i sought for him he was walking with hasty steps before her door upon seeing me he was turning away but moved by my broken voice he stopped looked upon me and addressed me you saved my son berchtold but my daughter my beloved daughter dies it is however useless to speak to you leave me/ go to your room louisas better every thing seemed confused to me i could not believe that i was the cause of louisas ill ness i could not believe that she could love such an outcast as myself i was several times in the course of the night by her door listening for some sound that should assure me of her existence i fell asleep at last upon the sofa in my room and 1 saw her in my dream as when she first appeared before me glowing in health buoyant with spirits suddenly i thought she ran towards me but ere she reached me she faded like a flower and fell to the ground 1 awoke all was still but my heart beat violently it seemed as if this were the fulfilment of my former dreams my vices were the evils the warning voice of my mother commanded my sister to fly for they were doomed to be the death of all i loved morning came my </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> my first enquiries were concerning louisa she was very ill and in a state of great weakness doni was not yet risen and was apparently quite overcome during the whole day i was not one moment at rest j i wandered from one room to another and sent every instant to enquire concerning my protectors daughter i stood by the door watching all who came from her room and begged them to tell me every change they observed towards evening a packet was put into my hands it contained receipts from every one of my creditors there was no explanatory paper imagining it to be the gift of doni 1 determined to thank him i went to his room i found him lying upon his couch very much fatigued and exhausted he was courting repose but it was in vain anxiety was painted upon his face and grief seemed to stamp him with its chilling furrows my first question was concerning his daughter i then showed him the packet and had begun to thank him when he interrupted me young man thank not one who wished that you should first have paid the price of your vices before he freed you from your embarrassments i spoke but little what she did utter however were words of kindness and they were all her weakness allowed her to say she often turned her brilliant eyes upon me and the soft smile upon her lip i thought was excited by the gentle whisperings of hope that i was snatched for ever from vice the latter part of the morning was passed near her in a silence that was not mute for there is a language which though not addressed to the ear still speaks the thought within her physician came and advised me to retire 1 bade her farewell an anxious look accompanied the words where are you going but when i intimated my determination of staying at home i cannot describe to you the joy expressed upon her face as she repeated my farewell 1 had been so little at home that i knew nothing of what had lately happened i was therefore much surprised when upon desiring a servant towards night to see if doni was in his apartment he refused saying he had not courage upon making enquiries i found that their masters supernatural powers had been much talked of lately amongst the servants for during the latter days unusual noises had been heard in his room and every morning all his things had been found in a strange confusion while he was apparently so exhausted that it was evident he had had no rest during the night thinking all this </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> this very explicable from the state of anxiety in which he had been kept 1 tried to convince the servant but he appeared firm in his belief and refused to carry my message louisa seemed rapidly to recover strength as we were in the very middle of summer it was thought proper by her physicians that she should be removed to a cooler situation than the neighbourhood of a great city we accordingly retired to the banks of the lago maggiore the palace close to the lake was refreshed by the cooling breeze that passed over the waters vast expanse and the playful fountains that sported with their noisy showers in the apartments towards the land promised to shield the invalid from the noxious effects of an italian sun j while the magnificent scenery of the varying basin before our view seemed to promise relaxation to the mind we arrived late at night and immediately retired to our beds i arose betimes and issuing forth ascended the numerous terraces which one above another seemed like the work of some enchanter when viewed from the waters edge garden seemed to be hanging above garden as if man had acquired the power of piling natures gifts even into the air i did not heed this for my native mountains were in sight 1 did not gaze upon the rich islands which seemed like fairy dwellings spring ing from the lake i gazed upon monte aosa which high above the neighbouring hills asserted the glory of its alpine birth though all around seemed burnt by the suns ray it mocked his power and bore its unvarying white vest in defiance of his frown upon its aged limbs while yet engaged looking upon its high summit with all the crowded images of infancy offered by my memory my sister passed me she seemed lately to have lost all her spirits she did not appear to be attracted by the beautiful scene near us or the sublimity of the alpine ridge beyond she was gazing upon the ground i joined her she started and with a trembling voice asked me why i was come i answered her at that moment 1 saw olivieri turn the corner of the alley and approach but immediately he saw me he retired and i at the same time perceived that my sister was violently agitated i looked at her and begged of her to tell me what i was to imagine she hastily replied nothing nothingand her colour which had deserted her at the sight of olivieri returned with greater rapidity than it had fled the moment before 1 insisted upon an explanation she said she was unwell weak and </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> and made other excuses of the same nature i now remembered her agitation a few evenings before when we were ininterrupted by the count wilhelm i threatened if she would not satisfy me to seek an explanation from olivieri she fell upon her knees before me begged me not assured me that it concerned a third person i was moved i had the weakness to promise that i would seek no farther i had not seen my friend till this moment since the payment of my debts he had never been home and 1 had not sought him he had not accompanied us and x had not been aware that he was expected i reentered the house hoping to find him but no one had seen him and he did not appear at breakfast louisa made her appearance at that meal you may imagine my pleasure at again seeing her out of her sick chamber she made room for me by her side i accompanied her into the orangewalk near the house and i sat near her for two hours while she enjoyed the beauty of the scene she looked at the alps then at me it seemed as if the recollection of our first meeting passed through the minds of both involuntarily i opened the bosom of my vest and showed her the scarf which i had constantly worn since that day she smiled i did not think of this at that time she said 1 did not know your name but when the fame of berchtold ernestus berchtold was echoed by the wild rocks to the voice of every peasant i sighed and wished he might be the chamois hunter of the wengern alps it was i sent the saviour of my brothers life to battle i sent the hero to aid in the rescue of kis country it was in vain yet i was conscious of a feeling of pride whenever i thought of it she spoke of my former life and passed in silence over that part when every moment had been spent in shame i cannot describe my sensations to you the feeling of how little i deserved such praise mingling with the pleasure of hearing it from louisas lips embittered what else would have been the proudest moment of my life her father joined us and seemed pleased at seeing us together he seated himself upon the other side of his daughter and we spent the whole morning together in conversation till the sun becoming too powerful louisa was obliged to retire for shelter and repose and we separated day passed after day and louisas health seemed rapidly to recover but my sister evidently became </highSuspense4> <highSuspense1> became more and more restless she generally avoided and very seldom sought our society i knew not what to understand determined however to force her to an explanation i one evening finding her alone induced her to walk out with me we wandered without perceiving it into the garden she seemed determined upon silence wrapt in thought the suns red disk fast sinking in the west the birds evening carol the varied light of the heavens reflected from the soft silky clouds over the purpling surface of the lake the cooling breeze which played upon her feverish cheek were all unnoticed yet she was wont in all that feeling of natures charms which accompanies youth to gaze upon that orb and figuring it as the image of that providence she adored think the birds sang hymns of thanks to him for all he gave but now she passed and all was unheeded there was a seat upon the rivers side which shaded by the plants that crept entangled round the branches of a noble chesnut formed a bower whence all the beauties of the rich nature round could be viewed i attempted in vain to enter upon the subject of what was causing this apparent misery in her breast she was abstracted and answered merely by monosyllables i at last ceased to press her and we both sunk into silence the spreading clematis of the bower hid us completely from the path near us while its open leaves allowed us to see distinctly all that passed in die avenue there was a wall of cypress which ran along one side of the gravel walk fully exposed at this moment to the suns rays i saw at last approaching from the bottom the count our protector he seemed in earnest conversation with some one but i could perceive no one near him yet his lipsand hands certainly moved as if he spoke as he gradually approached i could even distinguish sounds i motioned julia to observe him she did so and soon pointed to the hedge i could not at first see to what she directed my attention but at last i perceived the outline of a figure through the shape of whose body the very leaves were visible j something in the man ner that i have seen in the summer a current of heated air accurately defined by the wavering outline of the things between which and our sight it stands only that this was even more sensible to vision i could not distinguish its voice but i at last caught some of the words of doni i had hardly time to make these observations when the count seemed to </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> to start and the figured vapour went we did not movej we for some time seemed rooted to our seats at last doni disappeared amidst the trees and we looked at each other it was then true what we heard at the lake of thun our protector had communication with a spirit my sister seized the subject of conversation with avidity we related to one another several slight circum stances which had come to our knowledge many incidents which we could not explain the reluctance of the servants to approach the chambers of the count all pressed upon our minds the immense wealth which seemed inexhaustible must it appeared to us be connected with this untenanting spirit we resolved not to mention the circumstance we had just witnessed to any one but it wasnot effaced from our own memory we returned to the house and saw our protector there as usual but his face was or i imagined it to be pale his eyes wandered and then seemed to fix their angry glance at times upon us j but whether this were imagination or reality i could not decide i went to bed but not to sleep the thoughts of having seen an uneitibodied being the tales of my fostermother of power of wealth arising from the communication with beings of another world arose before me obtaining such a power it seemed as if 1 might learn the things hidden in the earths deepest recessed the oceans depth i even thought that by such a power i might tear away the veil which the first cause has thrown over itself nor did these visions disappear with the mornings light they were as distinct in the suns brightness as in the nights obscurity i arose determined to speak on the subject with the count he met me with an affectionate embrace i took his hand had the words upon my lips when meeting his eye i saw expressed therein such anxious fear such meaning that the words fell into inarticulate sounds instantly his eye was as usual nothing but brilliancy was there we went together to fetch louisa from her apartment and descended to the breakfast table louisa seemed to take a great pleasure in my society and sought in every way to bring me near her she seemed afraid of trusting me to myself in my first steps towards retracing the paths of virtue she again resumed the subject which had formed the topic of conversation before her fatal departure to visit her sick relation she painted to me the charms of a religion which taught us to look up to the infinite power above us not as to an object </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> object of terror and fear but of love and hope her mind without losing the least of that delicacy which is the magic charm that spreads its influence round the footsteps of woman was energetic and clear her simplicity was not misled by the winding intricate sophisms of the deist and unbeliever her belief was built upon persuasion which though it had at first depended upon faith had not scorned the bulwarks of reason the earnestness with which she spoke did not make her appear bold or presuming for the mild lookof her dark eye seemed looking to heaven to beg for inspiration from bim whose cause her lips were pleading she would often lead me towards the chapel and without affectation would kneel down by my side motioning me to imitate her and bending devoutly before her maker would pray for me i did not think of myself but gazing upon that veiled eye wliich did not seem to think itself worthy of looking towards the throne of god while petitioning for strength against mortal weakness a prayer would involuntarily rise from my heart for her 1 did not feel the time long when near her though it was even spent in prayer to have communication with the almighty in union with her seemed to be an additional bond amongst those numberless ties which bound me to her from the first moment that i had seen her she seemed to visit this earth as my protecting angel now it appeared as if such a being had led me to the throne of him of whose commands she was the bearer i did not notice the lapse of months and autumn had already vested the scene around with its checquered hues ere this happiness was interrupt ed i had even forgotten all my imaginations concerning the being attendant upon doni it seemed as if misfortune could no longer visit me such is human foresight i have already mentioned to you the singularity of my sisters conduct it grew more and more remarkable she never came down in the morning but confined to her room she spent the hours in solitude when she did appear it was but to retire to a corner where enveloping herself in her shawl she apparently brooded over some thoughts that destroyed her peace her appearance was completely changed her auburn hair which once floated in ringlets of soft varying light upon her shoulders was now entangled and neglected her cheeks ori which was wont to play a hue more delicate than that of the white rose were pale and sickly j her eyes no longe shone with sparkling lustre they were now heavy and inflamed from </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> from the want of sleep i often saw the silent tears fall from her eye but it was in vain to question her she wept bitterly at every enquiry i made and seemed agitated to the most violent excess whenever olivieris name was mentioned i was bewildered by the enquiries of doni and louisa who constantly expressed their anxiety concerning her we were assembled together at the breakfast table as usual one morning and were conversing about julia who had made her appearance the evening before at thesupper table which she had not done for a long time when a servant came to tell us that her maid had applied several times in the course of the last hour for admission to her room but that she could obtain no answer louisa offered to see if she could obtain admission in vain we went together all all was silent we burst open the door there was no one every thing seemed in disorder the bed had not been slept in the last night upon the floor there were many pieces of paper torn into fragments and upon the table there was a note addressed to myself i took it trembling i was afraid she had committed some desperate act i could not open it but gave it into donis hand he read it my shame can be no longer hidden i fly then to hide myself curse not your sister my own feelings are sufficiently bitter to satisfy even the injured honour of berchtold yopr degraded julia i sunk upon the bed olivieri immediately presented himself to niy mind as the seducer of my sister i could not speak an< my friends were sileht they looked upon me with pity i dared not inform them of my suspicions they would bring the old mans grey hairs to their grave and would cut off the feeble thread of life in louisa she bore up against the v shock and while the tear trembled in her eye she sat down by me and strove to sooth not console me for that she knew was impossible servants were sent in every direction i searched all the neighbourhood i de termined instantly to go to milan and make enquiries directly from olivieri concerning the fate of my sister 1 made a plausible excuse for my departure and soon reached the corso donis palace the servants had not seen him for some tijne i forced myself to seek him in the places which had been my former resort my late companions hailed my approach but i turned from them in disgust olivieri had no where been heard of lately distracted by my suspicions which now seemed </highSuspense2> <highSuspense2> seemed to wear the semblance of certainty after several days spent in the vain search j returned to the xake we soon fixed ourselves again at milan it was now impossible to keep his sons absence a secret from deni he learnt it but did not seem to imagine any connection between the flight of my sister and his sons conduct perceiving this i did not intimate to him my horrible doubts but left him in entire igno rarice in the mean time i made the most minute enquiries concerning both but could learn nothing louisas health in the mean time gradually recovered but she never lost the hectic flush upon her cheek she gained strength but the seeds of death were hidden not destroyed during her gradual recovery iwas always with her and if you can picture the happy hours of one sitting by a being he loves adores at the same time that his imagination paints her to him as a spirit of heaven you may imagine my happiness when sitting by louisa whose smile whose glance told me she loved she had gained me fame had saved my life my honour had restored to me the hopes of a future state the belief in a kind god i know not your belief your principles you may sneer at the feeling which dictates my ranking the two last with the former but young man believe one who has experienced the whole of fates wantoninflictions he whocan still rest upon futurity confident in the good ness of his maker may find arefuge in the greatest misery he who cannot may indeed despair he has but the present and that may indeed be dreadful louisas image was always with me i loved her but so did every one i could not for that reason hope to gain her i was an orphan how often has the thought of that sunk my buoyant hope which still would revive i had no rank count wilhelm had agairireneved his addresses it seemed dishonourable in me to continue any longer near her endeavouring to gain her affections it seemed as if the debt of gratitude i owed to doni forbade my attempting to gain his daughter the count had rank and wealth i could not hope that her father should prefer medegraded by vice my birth perhaps tainted with dishonour to one whose name was aspell upon all europe i had determined to leave milan and to plead the necessity of further enquiries for my sister doni approved of my intentions and in a few days i was to set off i had been preparing for my departure and had been talking to the servant </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> servant about the trifles necessary for a solitary journey it was not yet the hour for the company to assemble and lost in sorrow i was slowly approaching the saloon when those notes which had sung hope to me in prison sounded on the air they were falling upon the breeze broken and in a melancholy tone though the air was lively it seemed as if louisa sought to sing of hope while her heart could not echo back the strain i had not heard the song since i sunk into vice the sound was silenced i entered louisa was leaning upon her harp her head was fallen upon her hand there was no light and the lowering clouds hid the little daylight that might have been afforded by the setting sun 1 could just distinguish her form almost lost in the obscurity suddenly she moved struck her harp in wild notes and sung the words of a broken heart i could not hear more louisas name fell from my lips sing not so louisa if you have not happiness who shall possess it she sunk upon a chair and 1 approached you leave me to morrow she said i shall no longer have any one to cheer me any one whom i can she stopped and hesitated i stood breathless by her side i shall i will return you will find me a corpse i feel no power of life within me it seems as if my soul still clung to life that it might converse with you when you are gone i took her hand i bade her if she loved me not to speak in words that pierced my heart love you she answered you cannot know what x feel towards you i am myself ashamed that any can divide my heart with god but you i fell upon my knees i will not go i cannot louisa has confessed her love she loves the orphan berchtold if that words could express the least part of what i feel i would speak i love you let my silence speak the rest i felt her feeble hand press mine she had fainted her weak health had not given her strength to listen we had not heard the storm which had burst over our heads i had not seen the flashes of heavens aiiger which had unobserved spread its lurid light around us i lifted her in my arms carried her to her chamber and delivered her to her maid she recovered i was alone the thunders echoed still in the distance and the horizon was lit by the forked lightning but in my breast the convulsions were not subsiding </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> subsiding at the first moment it seemed as if happiness indeed were mine but donis image came quickly across my mind and all 1 owed him seemed to be imaged as so many reproaches for my having stolen t the affections of my benefactors daughter the company assembled but i could not join them the tumult in my breast was too powerful to allow me to participate in the light frivolity of a drawing room i retired to my chamber and was soon lost in meditation upon that fatality which made the very circumstance on which i had rested as the bourne of all my hopes a cause of anguish and reproach i determined to see the count immediately after the company had retired no malefactor who is listening in expectation of hearing the lengthened toll warning him of the executioners approach ever counted the moments with greater anxiety than mine the clock struck and each brazen sound seemed to vibrate through my body as if it bore grief upon its sound at last the carriages began to depart and i entered the apartment of my friend i had never dared to call him father it seemed to my mind too sacred a title to be profaned by me he was louisas father i had been some time in his apartment before he entered he came his face was full of anxiety my daughter he said i fear is going to relapse some thing has agitated her strongly and she will not tell even her father what it is berchtold he continued you have never before seen a father in the agony that i endure my daughters life sinks visibly before me and i cannot discover the cause you have therefore no con ception of the pain it brings i knew not what to say olivieri too is i know not where perchance in the haunt of the lowest vice perhaps acting again the hero as when with you youarenotmychild yet you now form my only comfort my only hope i could not hear morehe praise me who had like the snake stinging the child enchanted by the beauty of its scales robbed him of his treasure insidi> ously won his daughters love 1 inter fupted him lama wretch not worthy of your affection your daughter loves me i have dared to tell her she was my only hope spurn me from you i expect it hut do not blame her i fell upon my knees do not blame her for loving such a wretch as me she pitied me and my da ring devotion changed pity into love my head was hid within my hands i expect ed to be </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> be cursed by him i looked up to as a father he raised me from the ground ernestus this is nobly spoken i will not reproach you with your former vices louisa shall be security to me that you will always prove what you now show yourself i was amazed i embraced him but could not speak louisa was to be minemy guide my wife at that moment happiness seemed to be descend ing from heaven to be our handmaid while in fact despair and horror were preparing their flight from the lowest abyss to wait upon our nuptials next morning i was admitted to louisas chamber i told her that her father had consented to our union a gleam of joy crossed her pale fece she said she was happy but those words were in a broken and weak voice i heeded it not so great was my joy i sat with her she listened to my plans of happiness and smiled it seemedas if she were conscious of there being but to be imagined i was at last called awayby my own servant who putting a letter in my hand told me that he had found it thrown in at the door it was my sisters handwriting fearful of agitating louisa i hastily put it into my bosom and making an excuse left her when in my chamber i opened the note the lines were few a mother appeals for her child to your charity she has buta short time to live but her child has not a broken heart julia berchtold had been written but a tear had effaced the characters thexe was the name of an obscure street in the most retired part of milan i immediately repaired thither and soon found myself in an abode of misery i cannot describe it was upon the highest story the roof in several parts let in the hot ray of the sun and the window was not glazed but stuffed with dirty rags it could not be called a shelter for the floor bore on its black soft texture the marks of every cloud that had passed /over it in one corner there was a bedstead over which was spread a blanket that seemed not to have been removed for many years it was so black and thick with dirt a broken dish and rags which i but too well recognized as the remnants of my sisters dress were the only things upon the floor i heard a difficult breathing which proceeded from the bed i approached and found my sister she was pale and squalid her hair entangled and loose covered her face and bosom and her clasped </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> clasped hands hung from the bed she was apparently asleep and her child was grasping her breast with its little hand trying in vain to obtain sustenance from its fevered mother i stood for some time gazing upon her finding she slept soundly i descended the creaking stairs and sending some person of the house for clothes and food i waited till they returned and carried them up with me the noise i made awakened her she shrunk from me j i did not call you for myself but this childs cry pierced my heart do do not therefore curse me if i have even brought you to witness your sisters infamy i could not die and leave my child sinking unaided upon my putrid corpse i spoke kindly to her she looked upon me aud said ernestus with an incredulous voice and burst into tears i soothed her spoke to her of her child induced her to take a little nourishment and saw her feed her little babe she looked at its eager eye and face while feeding at moments hugged it to her bosom while a stifled laugh escaped her she did not seem to notice me and i spoke not at last she fell exhausted upon the bed i gave her the clothes i had brought she did not heed me i hastened to doni related what i had seen he ordered every thing to be got ready at the palace and procuring a litter he accompanied me to the abode of my wretched julia at sight of him she hid her face and would not speak i had her conveyed to the litter with her child and we arrived at the palace the physician of the family being sent for announced to us that from the state of exhaustion into which she had fallen there were but a few hours remaining of her life i watched by her all night she did not speak 1 took louisa for my model and spoke to her of those hopes which had seemed on her lips to have the power of soothing sickness ami to still the fears of death she was moved by what i said for her cold hand pressed mine i put questions to her with regard to her seducer she was silent but a convulsive motion seemed to seize her whole features i urged her no more she seemed to revive a little in the morning auguring well from it i began to speak to her of her child talked to her of its health said it should be named ernestus and promised that i would be its father she raised her fallen head and looking </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> looking with tears in her eyes blessed me but hardly had the words fallen from her lips when shuddering she said my blessing i that thats a curse i took her to my breast she shrunk from me you know not whom you embrace it is my sis ter whom i hold in my arms i cried she burst into loud sobs and fell again upon her pillow you shall hear she replied what a sister she prepared to re late to me the whole of her late history i advised her to repose awhile first well well i shall have the less time to feel the blush of shame and to hear your reproaches tis better so she fell asleep after uttering these words but she was restless her free was convulsed and the twitehiijg of her arms began togivethesigasof the rapid approach of death 1 seised this moment of apparent seat to enquire for louisa she was mud better we had kept our discovery ef dulia a secret fearful of agitating her too much y i determined therefore to see her ket soaking someenquiry concerning me she might hear how i was engaged 1 entered her room and staid with her for some time she spoke of her love and added that all that she thought want ing was the presence of her brother and julia i could not answer but rose and again went to my unconscious sister she was disturbed in her sleep and was calling upon louisas name she seemed to reproach her for not seeing her but then she appeared to meditate and said true true l am an outcast she awoke looked wildly around met my eye she was lost some time in thought and then addressed me 1 know what you are waiting for but ere i unfold the whole of my shame give me your solemn promise that you will grant your sister her last dying request i gave it her you will then never mention to either of my former friends what i narrate and you will let me die certain that you will never injure him that ruined me for still still i love him i assured her that 1 would leave it to heaven to punish him for i was conscious it was olivieri louisas brother it was him the account that i had given of his bravery in the swiss war the description i had made of his daring feats had gained an entire possession of her imagination when therefore she met him at milan his beauty his specious manner and apparent knowledge had completed her fascination i myself when bewildered by doubts had sapped the foundation of </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> of her religious principles and olivieri who was not blind to her partiality had fanned the spark of scepticism till he had destroyed all belief in virtue and a future state i lost myself at the gambling table and my conduct was but an additional proof in her mind that the presentwas all that belonged to man before we left milan the seducer accomplished his criminal purpose though however shehadbecome a convert to his theories she could not divest herself of all feeling of shame much less could she entirely drive from her heart those doctrines which berchtold had instilled at that age when the first impressions become part of our very nature they hung around her and haunted her day and night she had sought for courage to apply to louisa or myself in her difficulties but had not dared her mind being in this state she described the effect upon it at sight of that being almost lost amidst the ambient ajr in coversation with doni as wonderful her mind had immediately recovered its elasticity for she hoped if she could obtain communication with such a being to be able to find some certainty amidst the hor rid dftubte tfurt revelled in her mind to procure the means of hiding her shame or daring to face the day by means of its power determined to team the spell which coaid raise a tram parent allpervading being she resolved to watch without remission the conduct of the count she learnt nothing for some time he apparently differed in no habit from the others around but the impression in her mind was not effaced at last it appeared to her that upon certain days the count never touchedanimal food and she found by observation that this happened on every combination of seven in the days of the month upon enquiry amongst the servants she found that upon the morning of those days the room of doniwas always in the greatest confusion and she herself remarked that upon the evening preceding he seemed always more anxious and the day after more fatigued than usual juliaresolved to watch the count upon the next seventh night she found that it was possible to look into his room through the wainscot of a closet for wood that open ed into the passage leading to his apart ment the night came meat had been avoided all were gone to their rooms only the footsteps of the domestics arranging every thing for rest sounded on her ear she described herself as having listened apparently for hours though only minutes elapsed while these sounds continned at last all was silent she said that not even the vine leaves </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> leaves overspread iag her casement were heard to rustle foe every breeze was hushed all was so quiet that the ear seemed to feel as it were the silence she was awed her heart beat quick she held her breath at that moment she thought a slow step sounded along the corridor alarmed she knew not wbji she seized her lamp and was upon the point of rushing out when the door stow ly opened and a figure clad in a white robe entered its dark black eye was fined its grey locks seemed as if no breath of air could move their weight no sign of life save the moving feet belonged to it for the face was pale the lips blueish it approached with an unvarying step it was doni its hand took hers within its cold grasp its eye shone as if a tear had passed over it its lips quivered as if it wished to speak or thought it spoke she stood still motionless while it approach ed it seemed as if she had strength for any thing but when it turned to go the lamp fell from her hand and she fell upon the floor it was morn ere her wildered senses returned it was too late doni never noticed in any way the event of that night she was bewildered she knew hot what to think it seemed from his up changed conduct towards her that he was unconscious of the event yet she asserted that she could not have mistaken the features of him who had visited her in that awful manner her imagination laboured her judgment laid down the ba lance and became as dead her phantasy painted to her mind pictures of splendour and of power more brilliant than those of the arab taleteller or god creating bramin but more than all itreprepresented to her the means of ensuring olivieris love which she could no longer flatter herself she possessed he had not seen her but for a moment since she had left milan dishonoured and then it was but to laugh at her fears which she was but too conscious were not in vain day followed day towards the seventh at times she caught donis eye fixed upon her as if it sought to read her mind but she thought this might be imagination yet it seemed to her as if her intentions were divined and that fjrom some cause or other they could not be opposed else why this silence the fatal night came julia determined to brave every thing went down that evening which she had not lately done to supper her agitation was great but she forced herself </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> herself to conceal itv she waseonsciom the counts eyes were fixed upon heirs yet she dared not to look up and meet his she rose to depart he came to her to say good night his voice faded him hie hand shook she retired to her room y she determined frightened by the awful

the wall as she gradually recovered herselfi she raised her eyes and looked through a crevice that opened to her sight the counts room i could not learn what she saw she however informed me that she discovered the means of raising a superior being but that startled at his appearance she had sunk to the ground she found herself jvhen recovered upon her bed but no one was near her she determined to

what was her horror when the walls of her apartment echoed but scoffs and mockings they seemed to say that she needed not a greater price than the grati fication of herpassions and that they would not

throughout the day to arrive in the night at sesto calende j she thence easily obtained a conveyance and reached milan she had sought refuge at a small inn and sending to olivieri he came to her but it was only to make fully known to her the horrors of her situation it appears he treated her with brutality though she did not say so he staid with her but a few minutes and left her for ever he

screamed for oliviericalled on him to come and see her dari she held my hands and looking on mo asked me my name denied it could be for 1 could not be more kind than olivieri y but why rest upon such a scene she died in the morning without a return of reason but still calling in the last moment upon her lover my sister was dead her trie had unfolded to me the causes whence her misconduct arose 1 was the source of all my colouring of olivieris goodxjuali ties my exposing to hen the sources of doubt in those doctrines onrsainted fosterfather had taught us my example in the career of vice were the causes of her faulther death it was yet but the second victim to my fate there were two others wanting i sat by the dead body reflecting upon the horrible fatality that had caused my virtues and my vices to prove alike mortal to the two beings who for many years had been the only companions i possessed in nature the only sympathizers in my joys and sorrows if the pangs of conscience could be depicted i would for your sake young man paint in its truest colours the horror i then felt the pangs i now feel but the attempt would be vain i had loved my sister with all that affection two isolated beings naturally feel towards each other she had been to me as the weaker part of myself which always needed protection and defence to me she had been the holder of all my secrets the partaker of all my sorrows when an outcast she had received me when a wretch she had not spurned me no one was with me when she died the servant of louisa found me many hours after her decease extended upon her corpse she came from her mistress to seek me i rose i knew not how to conceal the anguish of my mind louisa soon discovered it and obtained from me the knowledge of my sisters illness and death she did not enquire further she perceived i was not willing she should know the rest and was silent i was astonished to see how firmly she bore the shock she exerted herself to find some means of allaying my grief but she did not know that it was conscience that worked within i left her and her pretended strength was gone she had forced herself to assume an apparent calm to assuage my grief but could not command her own my sister was </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> was interred privately doni and myself were the only mourners and a tablet with merely the name of julia berchtold marked the spot where my sister lay her child was put to nurse i gave him his mothers and my own name that i might still have a bond between us every day i went to see tme little orphan and takinghimfrom the fearful nurse i gazed upon his infantile feee while a bitter tear fell from the eye of trim who had been the cause of his birth being loaded with infamy and shame while i looked upon1 him he would smile but that smile brought to my mind my sisters it was a melancholy playing of the lips that seemed to mock at the pleasure that excited it the eye was net lit up with the same fooling but still appeased absorbed in its continued grief </chapter> <chapter> part third i had already undergone more than mb to the lot of most men in this valley of miseries but i was not allowed repose from this moment nay heart was tom pieoemeal by fiends each more horrible than the other not many days had elapsed since julias death when olivieris father received an anonymous warning to prepare himself for the worst news the letter was dated sferasburgh next day he read in another letter that his son under an assumed name had been taken with several others of a band of robbers who had for a long time infested the banks of the rhine doni had now become aged and infirm he was not capable of undergoing the fatigues of a long journey yet it was hardly possible to hinder him from setting off to attempt saving his only son he blessed me when i insisted upon performing that office you have twice saved his life in the field of honour may you be as sue cessful in snatching him from the death of infamy he gave me unlimited power and rushed into his daughters apartment to seek there for the comfort all else seemed to deny him i departed travelled night and day 1 saw switzerland again but did not even notice it my mind was anxious was alarmed it seemed as if heaven wished by repeated inflictions of its bitterest curses to humble to the dust the family circle of my protector i was so rash that for a moment i dared to question providence so weak is all mortal know  ledge misery is but the fruit of vice virtue never feels the worlds infamy there is a heavenly beam of certainty in the merciful justice of their god that enables the just to look upon </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> upon all the inflictions of this life but as the most lenient atonement due to a tender though offended father for those weaknesses belonging even to our nature i arrived at strasburgh its fretted spire rising high above the houses upon the far extended plain for a long time marked the bourne to which i was tending while the winding road that forms the approach seemed to mock my endeavours to reach it justice had been summary there had not even been a regular trial but a court martial had been summoned and instantly had condemned the prisoners to death a respite had however been granted for a few days in consequence of the hopes entertained of inducing some individual to betray the secret retreats of their comrades i im mediately proceeded to the prison and ashed admission application being made to the governor and it being evident that i was not one of the gang i obtained it i entered bolt after bolt slowly sounded as they were farced from their rusty clasps and i found myself in a low gallery the damp was slowly falling in measureddrops from the arched vault above and the coldness of the chilly air made me shiver the jailor bore a torch before me its red light at last rested upon the strong fastenings to a narrows door i gave him money and ssiziag the torch entered upon a little straw covering a fow loose stones in a corner lay a form whioh seemed reckless of all the light of the torch did not cause it to move its hands were upon its face clenohed its whole posture was strained as if by the convulsive stiffening of its limbs it would harden itself against the inflictions of the mind i could not speak thrice i strove to utter the name of olivieri and thrice it stuck in nay throat speak i can listen tomyfate olivieri at last said in a hurried voice death they say silences all voices if it can silence that which echoes through the chambers of my breast scaring oblivion and repose i shall be content to die though on the wheel waiting when all my limbs are crushed for that repose the iron bar may give he did not move but seemed to mutter this addressing himself as much as me olivieri at last fell trembling from my lips he with one exertion stood erect his eyeballs straining in their sockets seemed to seek the horrid certainty they knew would blast them berchtold appeared before him he threw himself upon the straw and with a hand clenching with furious grasp his long black hair lie seemed to force his head </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> head upon the ground fearing his eyes should1 again turn upon me i sate upon the stones at his side laid my hand upon him bade him be comforted he shrunk as if my touch froze him i told him of my hopes of obtaining his release of the wealth i could employ in bribing his judges he looked up you talk to me of mercy julia was seduced by me i know it i replied it is your father who acts by me i am but my benefactors agent for him 1 am to attempt to save his son his son he echoed in a faultering voice true i was his son i in vain asked him for information on which to proceed he would give me none i left him i applied to the court which had passed his sentence 1 saw the members who had composed it in private they gave me an account of the desperate gang to which he had belonged and painted in horrid colours the devastations they had committed in the french territory it appeared that olivieri had put himself at the head of these outlaws and had with the most daring rashness and carelessness of life always eluded the numbers that often seemed tosurround him i made those who appeared favourable to my pleading great presents under the pretence of enabling them to aid the furtherance of my objects amongst the others the governor seemed to have the most influence i gave him immense sums which he promised to expend for the prisoners advantage the next day was appointed for the execution 1 had not seen olivieri again i was anxious not to encourage too much his hopes of life while all seemed uncertain i called early in the morning upon the governor i saw him he raised my expectations very high he said that if i could but find the slightest pretence for a respite that it was determined to grant it if i were to judge by your riches he and yourself must be of higher rank than you pretend i had concealed both our names now if you can but show that some one of influence is interested in his fate we will admit of an appeal rashly i ms induced to otter the names of olivieri deni and ernestus berehtold i ms apprised at seeing the man before me turn of a most deadly pale his limbs seemed to tail him but he in an instant reeovered himself his voice alone betrayed an emotion i conldnot understand he assured me that he would instantly occupy himself about it and i left him an hour afterwards i received a note </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> note from him saying that < i should prepare a a carriage and post horses upon the bridge and as the clock struck the first hour of the morning that 1 should present myself at the prison door where i should meet my friend that this had been thought the best means of allowing his escape passports were enclosed which would allow us to pass the bridge and we should then be in safety i immediately prepared every thing anxious for the arrival of the moment when i was again to save the brother of louisa towards evening restless i issued out i wandered up and down that part of the main street which covered by arcades brought to my recollection the towns of my native country memory was rapidly crowded with the images of infancy while the evening tints and the stillness of nature soon enabled me to abstract myself entirely from the surrounding objects i at last found myself in the cathedral there was no one there eveu devotion seemed for a while to have laid aside its pomp to enjoy the balmy freshness of an april evening i had at last advanced into the most obscure part of the aislej when turning round a light figure dressed in the singular vestment of the neighbouring peasantry caught my eye her step was hurried and her head moved anxiously as if seeming to shun observation thinking that my presence might be painful i was retiring when she beckoned to me i stood still and she was immediately by my side she hastily addressed me you are a friend of olivieri donis you perceive from my knowing his name that i am in his confidence he once professed love to me he has probably done so to many more who are now like me ashamed of their name but even if i told it you it would be useless hoping to be of service and anxious to hear of him who still possesses my affection though he has broken the peace of her who loves him but i deserve it for i am guilty he cannot love guilt i am so lowered that i was not ashamed to gain my object by seeking one of the prison guard i have just left him intoxicated from him i learnt while he was blabbing all that he was called upon to perform a service this night in the course of his duty that he disliked i gained from him that he was to belong to a party who were to lurk in one of the streets and seize my lover and yourself at the moment you thought yourselves secure of freedom for that </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> that the police were anxious to tace you who they susr pected belonged to the same gang and therefore had resolved to arrest you while engaged in aiding the escape of your friend which alone will ensure your condemnation i was astonished could i then be so shamefully betrayed i immediately remembered the sudden emotion of him who had promised so much when he heard our names and it dashed upon my mind that i had a faint recollection of his name as being that of an officer in the french troops opposed to us in theunderwald who having been placed in a post of importance had been surprized by olivieri and myself and had been in consequence of his precipitate flight broken and disgraced it was now nearly dark i could not think of deserting olivieri without still attempting his rescue the girls information might be false i spoke with her she appeared sincere i offered her money she refused it my case was desperate i determined to confide in her i got her to lead me to the neighbourhood of the prison and show me all the turnings and secret cuts through the different streets i soon gained a perfect idea of the plan of this part of the town and 1 began to hope in consequence of the intricacy and number of turnings in this neighbourhood that i might elude the ambush if could at any point break through the guards 1 did not entirely open my plan to my guide but asked her if she knew of any certain place of refuge whither i could retreat in case of need she led me and showed me her apartment it was miserable but there was an air of neatness about it that seemed in contradiction with the poverty visible in every article if you can arrive here without being observed you are safe to avoid suspicion i immediately left her and returned to my hotel which was close to the river the hour approached i armed myself with a sabre and a pair of pistols and hiding under ray large italian cloak another sword and pair of fire arms i sauntered negligently out of the inn door and calling my servant i told him in a loud voice to take care the horses were ready as 1 intended to set off the moment i had fixed on this i did to blind anyone who might be watching my motions then turning down some of the most abrupt windings i first went whither i had learnt the different parties were to be placed by means of keeping close to a shaded part of the walls of the streets which </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense4> which being lit by a single reverberating lamp suspended in the middle between the houses were rather dark i could approach very near them without being perceived 1 discovered one point which ithought weaker than the rest for the number of the men seemed smaller the silence being greater i then returned entered the main street leading to the prison and soon found myself at its gate without meeting any one the high narrow windowed walls were suddenly illuminated by the moon bursting in all its splendour from behind a cloud and high above my reach i perceived some one watching me he retreated and i heard the gates open 1 could not perceive who was there for the hollow opening was in the dark shadow thrown over it by a salient buttress my heart beat violently it might not be olivieri a person was pushed out i heard the words i am free spoken in a voice that denoted the despair within 1 approached it was olivieri throwing off my mantle i stood before him he did not notice me though the moons ray was full upon us 1 roused him thrust the sword and pistols into his hand and bade him follow me we are not safe we must baffle the traitors yet said i be firm we have escaped greater perils than these follow me his broken voice merely answered to death 1 hastened towards the point i thought the weakest a shrill whistle sounded at our back and we found ourselves surrounded the first who approached were dead at our feet they retreated before us we had broken their circle and were already free towards the street down which it was necessary to turn now to the right i cried to my companion a shot struck him and he fell i rushed to the spot hoping that he might rise 1 struck on every side determined not to leave him in their hands their numbers increased but at the same time i heard a trampling of feet at my back desperate 1 rushed forward j a female shriek struck my ear and at the same time i found myself joined by about twenty men their blows told we caused the townguard to retreat 1 could not again find olivieris body i rushed along the streets and was soon at the young womans door i heard voices alariped i listened they were evidently from their conversation trying to console some one i knocked a female voice immediately exclaimed tis he and the door was opened i entered olivieri was extended upon a couch> attempting to write a few lines j he had just finished around him were many </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> many men in a strange uncouth garb they were his former companions who having received the same intelligence from the girl as myself had resolved to attempt a rescue and had stolen singly into thetown olivieri gave me what he had written it was to his father his pale face was turned towards me his feeble arm could hardly support its own weight berchtold i have not deserved the risking yourself for me can can you forgive me dying i do was my answer and i held his extended hand he threw himself upon his bed and in a stifled voice there is another whose forgiveness 1 do not ask but tell oh tell her it was her shame that has damned me that made me desperate damned me shes dead she too would have forgiven you she died speaking of you but not cursing you his limbs were instantly relaxed and moved no more we were now aroused by the entry of another robber the soldiers were approaching i begged of them not to leave the body of my louisas brother to their insults they lifted it from the couch and placed it in a recess so artfully contrived that it bid defiance to the most accurate search and they promised me they would return and bury it we took the young woman with us and separating we singly hastened to a spot by the rivers side where we hoped to find boats ten only reached it we entered a small wherry the town was in such confusion that the necessary orders had not been sent to the different boundaries we let the boat float down the stream and soon found ourselves beyond the fortifications we landed on the german side and presently reached one of the dwellings of the free hooters i now learnt that it was this same girl who had written the anonymous letter to her lovers father i offered her a considerable sum of money again offered to secure her an independence she refused it all and insisted upon remaining with those men amongst whom she had first known olivieri 1 remained with them a considerable time anxious to see the body of my former friend secure against any insult and before i left them aided by the daring of these men who managed to enter the town and take the body from its secret hiding place i had the satisfaction of consigning him to the earth i gave them all the loose money remaining with me secure upon my letters of credit of having more than enough to convey me whither i liked i reached inspruckj not deeming myself safe in any part of the </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> the french territory i determined to remain here and i wrote to doni merely mentioning that i had been unsuccessful and telling him where i had stopped i thought it best not to tell him more for fear of my letter being intercepted and hoping that when i saw him 1 should be able to break the fatal news to him my last hope was vain for all the papers and public prints con tained afull account of the daring attempt 1 had made to save a robber from the ig nominious sentence of the law our real names were also mentioned and at the same time that many rested upon the courage they pretended had been shown in this attempt many took advantage of the connection of our names with a gang of robbers to throw discredit upon our former conduct in the cause of switzerland it was soon known through my banker at inspruck that i was the notorious ernestus berchtold and i was surrounded by people who were glad to seek some refuge from their ennui in gazing upon one whose name seemed to have something like romance attached to it count doni arrived louisa too though weak and feehle still in better health than when i had last seen her accompanied him she had been forced to exert herself to support her father under his anxiety for his son and then under the severe blow of seeing his own name in all the prints known to all as the father of olivieri a captain of banditti/ the spring had given her the requisite strength and i was glad after so long an absence to see her once more sitting by my side with renovated life i could not take my eyes from her and i rested upon her face so long that i gradually forced myself to hope that her hectic flush was but her natural colour we were constantly together and tried in each others presence to forget the griefs that weighed upon us both i had given the last lines of my former friend to his father he had read them in his own room and though when we next met i remarked that his eye turned upon me wet with tears as he evidently did not in timate the least inclination to expose to me what his son had written i did not seek to learn the substance of olivieris note though 1 was anxious to learn whether he had disclosed his conduct to wards julia we never after mentioned his name and we tried to keep the thoughts of his melancholy fate out of our minds by resting upon our hopes of louisas </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> louisas welfare count wilhelm whom i have before mentioned found us on his way to his native country hearing of our being at the same hotel he sent in his name to my friend day after day he remained at inspruck the whole of the evening was spent with us in our apartment and he seemed to seek more and more the means of showing attentions to louisa at first i was not disturbed by them but at last i became fretful and irritable for it appeared as if louisa took a pleasure in his conversation i had heard so much of his power of attaching women that it seemed impossible for her to resist him every thing he did though the most simple action was perverted in my mind to a covert sneer at my poverty and insignificance i often answered him abruptly and even insulted him louisas meek eye turned upon me but it seemed to have lost its influence i one night found him by her side he seemed to be earnestly pleading he had hold of her hand and she smiled stung to the quick by so slight a circumstance 1 turned furiously away and retreated to my chamber had berchtold taught me to command my passions had he but shown me as models for my conduct men in the privacy of life 1 might have escaped much it is vain to rest upon it i had thought that louisas influence over my mind would have hindered me ever again losing myself hurried away by any passion but here louisas form arose in all the hideousness of jealousys distorting mirror i was mad my clenched fist struck the table 1 could not command myself 1 remained some time in this state when turning my eyes to wards my bureau i perceived an alma nack 1 seized it in mockery 1 counted up the days since she had told me she loved me i was suddenly struck it was the 28th day of the month it was a combination of seven it seemed as if by one exertion i might free myself from doubt and be at once lost in the horrible certainty or be for ever blest in the knowledge of louisas heart i did not reflect the hour struck j i seized my lamp and rushing out was al> ready close to the apartment of doni when wavering on the wick the flame suddenly sunk and expired yet nothing around was dark it seemed as if i was surrounded by a mist formed by a dazzling light too dazzling to allow me to view the objects round i was a moment startled but undismayed i strove </highSuspense4> <highSuspense2> strove to rush forward my feet were bound to the floor i strove but in vain to move gradually the light cleared and gradually the features of that face which i had so often gazed upon in my imagination my mothers appeared distinctly before me her form was majestic but in her eye there was a softness which was not even destroyed by the severity of her feeling ernestus were her words heaven has decreed at my prayer that this crime shall be spared to you you shall not act ungratefully she seemed to vanish with an expression of sorrow upon her face as if she were not allowed to continue and felt the horror that burst upon me in consequence of the ignorance in which i was left my senses forsook me and the dawn of day had already pierced the thick clouds before i recovered i did not return to my room i went into the open air my thoughts were hurried j baffled i was not subdued jea lbusy still was not banished i did not rest upon my mothers apparition so strongly had the idea of louisas infidelity taken hold of me while walking amidst the intricate windings of a public garden 1 heard voices near me one was count wilhelm i heard him boasting of the favours of some lady whom another thought loved him and he suddenly presented himself before me i grossly insulted him he took a pleasure in torturing me with his pretended concern at my mistresss kindness to another i struck him we fought and he fell severely wounded i stood by him and he was amply revenged he told me that he had seen me entering the preceding evening that being at that moment engaged in speaking about me and louisa having expressed her wish that i might be received into the austrian service he was offering his interest to forward my views and that knowing how easily 1 was irritated he had purposely taken her hand he advised me to fly i was obliged to do so for i was no longer safe where i was louisa was then innocent i cursed that fate which seemed to hang about me always shielding me from death i had fought in battle but never yet had received the slightest wound i had escaped from prison while the axe was falling my rashness seemed to be incapable of hurting mej for there was a shieldround me that snatched me from peril i was preserved from worse than death even this last act could not divide me from louisa she loved me indeed alarmed at seeing my antagonist brought in wounded she did not </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> not shriek she did not give herself up to loud and weak lamentations j but conscious that probably my life depended upon the event of his wound she sacrificed herself entirely to the care of the invalid with unremitting attention she watched by his bedside but when he was declared free from danger then the cold hand of strengthened disease made itself felt she was obliged again to return to her sick chamber but first she begged her father to inform me of the favourable result i returned doni met me on the stairs embraced me but no joy was visible on his face he announced to me the dangerous state in which louisa lay but did not reproach me she had forbidden it 1 was introduced into her room consumption was ruining her system she was faint and weak j her continued cough and the marked colour on her cheek but too well denoted the power it had acquired i could not even ask her how she felt but the tears fell down my cheek on the moist hand that held mine she allowed me to stay with her talked to me of that power whose pleasure it was to strengthen the weak and console the wretched she said that he had soothed the agony of deaths visible approach and until she saw me that she had found relief in the thought of the short time we should be separated but now she saw my grief she was sorry i should he left alone even for those few moments without a being to whom i was attached that she again wished for life if amidst all its miseries she could buthope for the power of consoling me through these inflictions in fine she did not speak of herself but of meof the wretch who had gradually broken the weak threads which bound her pure soul to life count wilhelm perfectly recovered left us 1 had seen him and as the only atonement in my power had acknowledged my folly and had begged he would pardon it though it had been so severely felt by him he returned a vague answer and i saw him no more donis interest was great his wealth insured him friends active in bringing back to their neighbourhood one whose riches fell in beneficent showers upon all by their influence he soon obtained a pardon for my resistance to the civil au thorities in behalf of olivieri and 1 was granted permission to return to any part of the french territory as the cold alpine air seemed to hasten the rapid steps of his daughters decline he determined upon having her conveyed again to the borders </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense2> borders of the lago maggiore which had seemed last year to have possessed such renovating powers we departed and soon found ourselves fixed in our abode nature wore the same aspect as the year before palanza with its white walls and glittering columns shone as brilliantly in the suns ray the smile of heaven seemed to play upon the fairy islets of the boromei and the rich woods of belgirato reflected in the blue surface of the water seemed to put the beauty of this in competition with the sublimity of the wild rocks of the upper part of this long lake but louisas health had faded she could hardly hope if the disease continued its hasty steps to see these scenes again but still that fairy enchan ter hope acted tpon me and as each day she gained some slight addition to her strength i pictured to myself years of happiness united with her i had long so ardently loved she would not undeceive me but left me the illusion she was again able to enjoy the freshness of the air and to walk out amidst the varying scenery around i supported her and felt the light pressure of her feeble form resting upon my arm she would stop and draw some reflections on the bounty of god even while in pain from the various pictures before her always attempting to turn my mind towards those thoughts which she well knew could alone give me consolation and a resting place in this vale of miseries but still she seemed to recover strength i entreated her to hope and not to give way to such desponding thoughts her father who was deceived as well as myself begged of her to console herself talked to her when alone of me and spoke of his hopes of seeing us united of her forming the only prop to his old age /and that i how could he say it was alone worthy in his estimation of receiving from a fathers hand so great a treasure unwilling to grieve her father she yielded to my importunities promised to be mine if upon a certain day her acquired strength had not given signs of decay you may imagine with what anxiety with what hopes i watched each intervening moment every cold breeze made me shudder j every cloud that veiled the suns ray caused me pain i counted her breathings whenever she moved watched the firmness of her step the day arrived she was not weaker but had seemed to find renewed energy in the thought of being mine she was mine i cannot paint to you the delirious state of mind in which the next </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> next months passed over my head i had a right to protect i was something to that being but i will not rest upon these feverish moments you may imagine thorn j louisa was mine louisa mine but heaven had not smiled upon our union no no it was but the anger of a god veiled under the brightest hues louisa was mybut i must relate the whole her health as the winter approached declined again and we returned to milan we lived with her father to engage my wifes attention i resolved upon fitting up a part of the palace anew for our private use every thing was ordered when it occurred to her that the best ornament we could add would be the portrait of her father i had recovered from my sister our mothers locket and shewing it to louisa we determined upon having it copied and hung opposite the counts to give doni as as we thought an agreeable surprize we determined upon having them privately executed and placed in their situation without his cognizance i sought far painter and spent whole mornings with him at his eazel directing him how to paint my mother i described to hin as well as i could her appearance to me at inspruqk and pretending that i had seen her in a dream i insisted upon his representing her in such a situation he executed it and by the magic effect of his pencil excited a most extraordinary impressionof awe in my breast whenever i turned my eyes upon the picture she seemed starting frpm the canvass the outline of her figure was lost in the blaze of light and her face meek amidst splendour severe though with features naturally mild seemed speaking those words x had heard i took louises to see it she felt the same awe as myself though she could not assign a reason for it hut she continued gazing till i perceived her eyes wet with tears the pictures were privately introduced into the house we had succeeded in keeping them secret from doni in a few days was louisas birth day we resolved therefore to make him our guest upon that occasion in our new apartment we invited several of our most intimate friends every thing passed in gaiety at last all the company were gone and we remained alone we then taking him each by one hand led him into what we intended should be our private sitting room telling him he should theri see our best friends the one in heaven the other on earth the door was opened directly before him was his own portrait vhie seemed surprized and pleased he </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> he turned round i had hardly announced to him that the one he then saw was my mothers when he fell alarmed we raised him your mother did you say your mother he threw himself upon the floor and called upon god to free him from the consciousness of horror like to his we knelt by him close together he saw us raised his aged hands and with a flattering voice bade us if we dreaded heavens most dreadful curse to separate but again he fell to the ground crying it is too late too late the crime is consummated we raised him he turned hastily away for he was opposite the portrait and besought us to take him thence we led him to his chamber he motioned us to leave him we retired in silence we knew not what to understand was it merely the greater effect of that portraits power which had been exerted over us we could not hope it we were lost in conjectures louisas health was so much broken that iwas alarmed for the effects it might have upon her and therefore strove to turn her mind from the subject but in vain she did not sleep the whole night the anxiety concerning her father would not allow her to seek forgetfulness even for a moment the effect may be imagined upon so weak a constitution her father refused to see us for several dysand each day i sawthemind acting upon my wifes heskh with alarming rapidity when this reached the ears of her father he could no longer resist our importunities he saw as but the sight of hfe haggwd and wild countenance did not vesture louisa fie had evidently toon engaged in writing we pressed him to ekplain his conduct fie replied i knew hot what i wished to learn it will blast you as it has done your friend you must learn it but it shall be when i am 4n the grave and before him who has thus punished my crime j then then i may intercede for you if i myself am sufficiently purified by buffering he may hear a fathers though it be a criminals prayer his words seemed almost incoherent he at times called me son but then with hurried impatience he corrected himself j he asked me whence i got that portrait i put the locket into his hands twas mine i gave it he hurried pressed it to his breast and hade us leave him we did j he saw us daily but ip sjutence be seemed absorbed in one thought and to that he could not give utterance he took little too little nourishment but always </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense4> always occupied in writh ipg he seemed but to find strength ftw that when we saw him he was hardly capable of motion his task was at last finished we had been with him as usual when we were suddenly recalled he was dying he hade us kneel down by bis side he blessed ns he took the papers from his table and putting them into my hands he bade me read them when he was in the grave and know the horrors that awaited me he commanded us to trust in gods mercy ami he sunk blessing ua upon his couch breathed no more i bore my louisa from this scene she was from this moment confined to her hed i saw the count laid in the vault of his ancestors and then returned to my wifes chamber whence i never issued till i had no longer a wife i was evident that all art was unavailing it was the undermining of a constitution not by a common bodily disease but by the griefs of a heart that had never lately found a moments respite from the most bitter inflictions yet even at this moment she seemed to forget herself in her attempts to console me she alone broke the silence around i sat in mute despair i saw louisa before me and i was to be left isolated scathed by divine anger without consolation she held my hand spoke to me of another world for a moment her words would even subdue my grief and let me feel as if that hope were enough at last seeing the silent sorrow that was pfeying confined within my breast she sought to rouse me bade me read those papers i did in a luckless moment only hinted at the horrible mystery unfolded there and saw the last convulsive throe i was destined to witness in any bound to me by love i cannot telf you more read that damning tale and then you may know what i dare nay dare not rest upon my his tory is quickly ended i was dragged from the now lifeless louisa but i stole from my guards in the night gained an entrance into the room where death showed as if boasting his beauteous victim dressed in pomp the wax tapers seemed to burn dimly as if in unison with the solemn scene the black walls the felted ground the corpse stretched out arrayed in white the stillness visible upon that beauteous face stilled even the tumult in my breast she did not seem dead but asleep i had held her in my arms upon my breast looking as she then looked i gazed upon </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> upon her tor moments it seemed as if i believed the still appearance wronged my senses i was about to press her to my heart my lips were approaching hers but i started there were two flies already revelling on those lips and she could not chase them i hurried away i could not remain any longer there i fellowed her bier afeo and i saw my dearest my last bond to this earth deposited there where peace seemed to invite me too religion louisas words however had not lost all influence 1 resisted that will which would have ted me to immolate myself a victim to the manes of those my love had slain the hopes of a futurity of louisa in heaven upheld me i retired first to beatenberg there in the former house of berchtold i spent seme time it was too near the first scenes of memory i left them and came hither j here amidst these rocks bound to me by no memory of the past i spend the few hours allotted me by heaven in pe nance here each day my prayer is offered npt that in merey i might be taken to louisa my life has been a life of anguish of vice of crime but still amidst tbeae there have been moments there has been a being which if life eould be renewed would cause me to dare all again once more to go through those few moments often in my dreamt i see that form hut now if when in this mortal life her beauty could not be de scribed how can i now that her fbrm her face are decked with the smile of him who glories inthe glory of his children when she now appears in my dreams there is no longer that hideous chasm opening between us y she is always decked as if for another bridal day and j awake confident in thatdays approach without guilt but leave me depart tomorrow upon your intended journey if that you stay who knows but the curse which has attended me through life may yet be acting and may fall upon you as well as all others whom i have loved these papers will explain to you what i have withheld the life of doni if that you return this way you may find me dead drop not a tear over my grave i shall be with louisa farewell but depart knowing that there exists a consolation which man cannot take from you which misfortune cannot destroy the belief in a future state in the mercy of a redeeming god it is there i find refuge the llfe of count ftliberto </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> ftliberto doni the family to which i belong is one of the most noble in lombardy j but i being the son of the younger branch did not enjoy many of those advantages which belong to high rank i was sent at a very early age to a college of jesuits and soon distinguished myself so much that all the allurements the society was in the habit of holding out to young men of promise were employed to attach me to this community i had however been educated amongst the mountains and having been nursed by an old retainer of the family i had conceived so high an idea of the importance and consequence attached to nobility that i could not resolve upon putting on a dress which bound me to forego all those advantages and pleasures the early associations excited by my nurse had taught me to believe belonged to the entry of a nobleman into that very world my venerable master endeavoured in vain to persuade me was every thing horrible in the mountains a son of even the lateral descendants from the lord is always looked up to with so much respect and veneration by the poor inhabitants of these districts that it is no wonder if i was deceived when the religious began to flatter and distinguish me above my companions as i was not conscious of any exertion in the acquisition of that mental superiority about which they talked i attributed their attentions to the respect they felt for one of such exalted rank as i imagined myself born to having been left also for the whole of the time with the men without having paid a single visit to my family the distant memory of what i had seen at home appeared to me ita contrast with the plain life of my superiors as something magnificent and passing comparison my parents heaving of the talents of their son were anxious for his entry into an order whose inference they well knew coaid be profitable in the greatest degree not only to the individual but to the whole of his family when therefore they found that theftson was determined not to bind himself by any bond which should hinder hint from enjoying what his imagination had pictured j they thought the best plan in such a case was to allow me to view nearer that misery which attends nobility devoid of riches i was accordingly sent for home i arrivedi was astonished at not being led to one of those numerous palaces i met on my way to my fathers in the streets of milan my guide and myselfcameat last arto the corso j i be </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> be gan to reconcile myself seeing the end of the city before me nothing but palaces on both sides 5 when suddenly we turned down a narrow street and i came to the gate of an obscure house i did not speak but my feelings were hurt i ascended a narrow staircase and i found myself in the presence of my mother she was lying on a conch covered with leather dressed in all the dirty tawdry of one who glories in the past she was playing with a dog with one hand while the ocher was stretched over an earthenware brafiaer a dirty servant slip shod with hair which had apparently never been touched by a comb led me into the room and announced me my mother did not even move she was too busily engaged by her puppy to notice me at last tired of seeing only the same jumps turning round in the act of stretching her weary limbs she saw my figure imagining it to be that of her son she addressed herself to me ah filiberto so you are really come home to load your parents with your expences when you might have become a jesuit tyith every prospect of power well we shall see how your father will bear it for my part i will not sacrifice any more first representations for your follies i had already engaged a box at the scala with the money i had spared from our very food when your father hearing of it went and sold the tickets because you were expected these were the first words remember my mother spoke to me i cannot desciibe to you the various feelings they excited in my breast i could not believe this to be my mother i did not answer her but engaged in thought i sat down and soon lost sight of the white cold walls and brick floor in the bitterness of my imaginations my father entered throwing off his huge great coat which placed upon his shoulders covered both his body and the clay vessel contain ing the heated charcoal he embraced me and seemed really pleased to see me i spent a miserable day for it was the very one on which a new opera was to be brought out and all the usual companions of my mother having by intrigue and what not secured places she was left alone without even her cavalier servente in the company of her husband and son this was insupportable and she did nothing the whole evening but vent her bad temper upon me sneering at my foolish ideas of rank my father who seemed accustomed to these scenes quietly </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> quietly took his seat in a retired part of the room and with his great coat confining the warm air arising from his scaldino around his body soon fell asleep the servant came in after the caffe and spinning at mymothers side for atime divertedherattention from me by joining with the complete appearance of an equal in all that mean criticism of their neighbours which is esteemed the more witt ac cording to its illnature i was at last glad to go to bed you may imagine what was the bed room of the son when the receiving room of the padrona was such as i have described as i passed by a door upon the staircase i saw two heads put out to look at me they were my sisters j i cannot describe to you the sensation i felt when i found no one had thought it necessary to bring them to see their brother or even to mention them to him i found them dressed in the most coarse clothes and i had hardly been there a few minutes before they began recounting to me the hardships and privations they had lately undergone in consequence of the anxiety of my mother to secure a box at the opera for this night it is useless to paint more scenes of this nature my mother was vain andspent even what should have been given to feeding her children in the most distant imitation of the rich to whom she had the honour of being allied and who condescended to laugh at her for her pains my father loved quiet above all things his income was small very ineompetent to supply the foolish vanity of my mother he was therefore always in debt and even obliged to be a mean hanger on upon the elder branch of the family next day i went with my father to visit the head of our family and i there saw whatmyimaginationhad represented to me the numerous servants seemed bustling about as if their wills were too rapid for their limbs the rich liveries which were almost reflected in the burnished floors of marble and precious woods the porphyry columns the fresco paintings and the silken coverings to even the footstools astonished me i followed in silence the officious servant who seemed amazed at my astonishment at that splendour in which he had always bustled though but the son of a cowherd we were conducted into the boudoir of our relation he was at his toilette every thing breathed effeminacy all was luxurious the delicately coloured curtains let in the enfeebled light of the noon day when i entered i could hardly distinguish the objects </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> objects around for coming from rooms illuminated by all the powers of the sun my eyes could not feel the weaker impressions of this veiled obscurity my relation struck with the astonishment i displayed at such magnificence amused himself with calling forth signs of wonder from me i was invited to stay with hita and i accordingly went from my mothers who was glad to get rid of the inconvenience arising from the addition i caused to be made to the daily expences at thesame time that she was proud of having to talk about the notice i had excited at the palazzo doni my relation conducted me every where i was introduced by him to the casino of the nobles and was always in his box at the theatre of la scala he advised me to attach myself to an old countess whose cavalier servente was just dead 1 did so and soon had the honour of carrying her shawl and whispering in her ear even to the exclusion of her superannuated husband at all the places of public resort i was now initiated into all the magic enjoyments of wealth and splendour without any riches or merit of my own i enjoyed all the luxuries which were not a little heightened by the visits i paid my fathers house where i saw poverty in its most appalling state accompanied by pretentions to rank i was intoxicated the countess had several daughters these i seldom saw though they were approaching rapidly to womanhood it however happened that soon after i had obtained a footing in her hpuse that a birthday of her eldest child occurred she resolved upon celebrating it by a little ball chiefly composed of the immediate connections of the family i was admitted by virtue of my office i had never before been in a ballroom the splendid chandeliers the gay dresses and the beautiful women surrounding me on every side raised a scene before me which even my most vivid fancy had never imagined i could not dance i was therefore a mere spectator but i was not idle i had never been accustomed to see unmarried females for they are not admitted into the society to which i belonged there appeared a charm about them i could not define they fixed my attention and as each moved in the light dance with ali the agility and grace attendant upon youth while their retreating looks seemed to denote a fear that they exeited observation i attempted in vain to discover what fascinated me my heart beat violently it seemed as if i had never before witnessed beauty towards the end of the evening a party of </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> of foreigners entered j they had come to reside in milan with them was a young lady she entered into the dances she had uot the light airy step of her companions she had not the same brilliancy of eye but there was something so powerful in her meek glance in her measured graceful step that enchained the senses from that moment i could gaze upon no one else she alone seemed to be moving she alone seemed to be the object worthy of attention i was yet gazing upon her when the countess called me to join her party at tre sette i accompanied her but it was in vain for me to attempt fixing my mind upon the cards before me 1 saw nothing but that figure which had been that moment before my sight i made blunders that called forth impatient exclamations from my partners and 1 was at last allowed to rise upon the plea of a headache i instantly entered the other room but she wa6 gone she had however left her image in my breast for several days i did not see her again but at last she began to appear in public for being a foreigner her pa rents did not confine her as is customary amongst italians i often left the countess in the theatre and placing myself in the pit near the box in which she was watched her slightest motion there was a melancholy look about her that seemed to indicate an acquaintance with grief that was extraordinary in so young a person her dark blue eye was seldom unveiled her long modest eyelashes generally hid their splendour and her silence and her uninterested glance added a charm to her figure i cannot describe her goodness and charity were spoken of by all her beauty was not envied or denied by her own while her gentle manners and winning smile seemed to gain the heart of all the other sex i accompanied the countess to her house i sat by her but could not speak with her it seemed as if the emotion in my breast stifled the words i was about to utter she however noticed me and her parents in repeating their compliments to the lady i accompanied included me in a general invitation to the house as it was not the custom for ladies of rank to rise until a late hour i had a great part of the day upon my own hands i used generally to lounge about and sometimes go to the ambrosian library in quest of something to engage my attention one morning i was there as usual and i found the ernachs there </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> there matilda was with them they were just then occupied in viewing the manuscript ofvirgil with petrarchs annotations when the cicerone pointed out the last note of this latter poet in which he speaks of his love to laura i could not help remarking a momentary emotion which passed across the face of matilda her mother also observed it and immediately taking her arm accompanied her into the room containing pictures of several of the greatest masters i followed diem and entered into conversation by pointing out the heads of the milanese raphael which one cannot examine without feeling a stillness come over our senses foreign to our nature there is so much beauty and heavenly quiet about them that they indeed resemble representations of a poets dream before we parted i was accepted as the guide to the curiosities whioh they had not yet seen and my office was to begin the next day it is useless to describe to you the gradual steps of love i at last neglected the attentions due to the countess while sitting by the side of matilda at last no longer capable of enduring the feelings within my bosom i confessed my love to the object i adored she was not angry nor did she seemed surprised but in a voice that betrayed inward agitatipn she begged of me to lay aside all hopes of gaining her hand and poqjured me not to mention it to her father i was confused and abashed i retired and returned to the palace where i confined myself to my chamber not having appeared for several days in society and enquiries being made concerning me i was soon sought for by my kind relation he seemed so dnxious about the ill health which he imagined was the cause of my absence from those gaieties in which i always seemed to delight that 1 was induced to lay open to him the whole of my heart he tried to administer consolation but could not succeed my vanity was mortified and reflecting upon my poverty i had imagined that i was despised for some richer rival he seemed to know matilda better told me he could not believe it but i dwelt so much upon the subject that he saw it was useless to oppose my opinion any longer he attempted to induce me to accompany him into society but i re fused and for some days remained alone in my chamber sick with all the splendour around which seemed to mock me i determined in spite of the expected reproaches of my mother to return to my fathers house where by long confinement i fell ill my kind relation </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> relation hearing of this came to me and tried to represent to me the folly of my conduct but disappointed love and mortified vanity did not allow me to listen seeing me thus haunted by the idea of riches he generously offered to advance me a considerable sum and to give me letters to a friend at alexandria where i might he thought employ my capital to the greatest advantage in commercial speculations i thanked him and accepted his kind offer i soon left milan determined never to return till those riches were mine which should enable me to assert a rank equal to any in my native city i arrived at alexandria and was soon engaged in mercantile speculations with an eagerness that caused all rfly transactions to appear more like the ventures of a desperate gambler than the secure projects of a merchant i found several europeans established in this city chiefly engaged in the commerce of grain amongst the rest there was one who seemed to form a particular attachment to me he was several years older than myself and was noted amongst us for a certain avoidance of pleasure which did not appear natural to his years he was always engaged when not occupied in bis business either in reading of in a solitary ramble through the burnt neighs bourhood of this ruined town i was the only person he sought he seemed to place his confidence in me and made many enquiries at first vaguely concerning those i had known at milan happening to name the ernachs his face immediately became anxious and his questions evidently bore a stamp of interest they had not before shown this excited my attention and caused me to make more particular enquiries concerning him little was known j he was a german and it was thought he had been disappointed in love he perceived the attention i began to show him and one evening when we were alone he told me that he had at first been induced to seek my society from a letter he hadreceivedfrom matilda you must have perceived the interest with which i listened to your account of the family of the ernachs know that i love matilda that i have reason to believe my affection is returned but that owing to my poverty x have never dared to confess even to her the feelings of love i bear within my breast we were together from earliest infancy all our pleasures were in common and though when i grew to manhood i no longer dared to use the familiarity of ray earlier years with her >vho began to vest the charms of woman still we partook </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense2> partook in the pleasures of each others occupations many things we studied together 1 read the lighter authors of literature to her while she was engaged in those occupations attendant in our country upon every female member of a family i at last opened petrarch and read those sonnets in which love is so delicately pourtrayed you cannot conceive my emotions when i perceived that she felt them as 1 did myself and that she often raised her modest eyes while a blush mantled her cheek to gaze upon me while my trembling voice seemed not to be reading the sentiments of another but speaking the feelings of my own breast we seemed indeed not to want to comment upon what we were both sensible expressed only those truths which echoed in the breasts of both when however i retired i always upbraided myself for thus exposing though indirectly that love of which 1 had no reason to think her parents would ap prove for i had no profession and was not born to riches when however i saw her and she again asked for the author whose delicate pencil only traced the most fading hues of love i again read we were thus engaged when we were interrupted by her mother who had stood unperceived some time watching the emotions but too visible in our countenances she did pot then speak but taking another opportunity when i was alone with her she gently intimated that i had not acted honourably in thus engaging theattention of matilda to such poetry as was but too powerful a seducer of the mind i was but too conscious of it i acknowledged my error and promisedtotakeno further occasion ofthus acting upon her daughters susceptible heart she placed entire confidence in me and was not deceived i applied to my father who at my desire sent me hither to push my fortune and i have succeeded as welkas i expected how shall i convey to you an idea of what passed in my mind before me stood the unconscious cause of my being rejected by matilda he had told me he loved her that she loved him i was silent when he epded i could not rouse myself to speak to him he thinking that this narration had tired me made an apology to which i could only answer by monosyllables j he retired and left me to my own thoughts it was evident matilda preferred another my feelings may be imagined < cannot be described it seemed as if some demon actuated me i fell upon my knees and dared even to call god to witness my vow of obtaining the object of my </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> my affections in spite of all obstacles it seemed as if i felt more at peace after having thus resolved upon not yielding even to him she loved the possession i ambitioned i sought huldebrand for so was my rival called determined to worm into his confidence and gam the whole of his secret i told him not to impute my abstraction on the former evening to any thing but my mind being engaged in thought upon a circumstance which i noticed at milan and which was now fully explained i then mentioned to him the emotion i had noticed in matildas countenance while listening to the memorial of petrarch with regard to the duration of his love this immediately secured his attention and i soon learnt many circumstances with regard to their early years and i became convinced that there was really no engagement between them in the mean time my speculations which had been begun rashly had for the greater part turned out badly and i found myself with a capital considerably diminished huldebrand who could not remain ignorant of my losses proposed to me as i seemed ignorant of the best means of securing a profitable commerce to join him i did so but growing tired of the slow advantages to be obtained by the regular channels i at last induced him to join me in a speculation that seemed to promise a certain and at the same time immense profit we ventured and lost all we risked my loss did not grieve me much for it had reduced my matildas favoured lover to the same want as myself he was not however dismayed nor did he reproach me but immediately exerting himself to recover all that remained of our property he proposed that we should join some armenians who were about to leave alexandria and penetrate into the interior of asia in hopes of finding some opportunity of bettering our small fortunes i consented and we accompanied them we entered persia and travelled even into india we soon found our capitals rapidly increasing for imitating the armenians we bought upon several occasions precious stones which we resold almost immediately greatly to our advantage it is in no way necessary for me to give an account of these countries towards the understanding the fatality that attended my life i travelled through them careless about the scenery orinhabitants the whole of my attention was engaged in my endeavours to acquire wealth matilda stood constantly before me as the bride of huldebrand and my fathers house always appeared in contrast with the palace of the head of our family i soon entered into the spirit of the traffic i was </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> was engaged in and restrained as i was by huldebrands steadiness we rapidly indeed accumulated an immense sum which we carried always with us in precious stones i had been particularly struck by the venerable appearance of one of our companions he was aged his head was white with the numbered years that had passed since his birth this was the more remarkable frond the contrast it offered with the jet black hair and beards of his coun< trymen he was never engaged in their occupations he never seemed to be concerned in any mercantile transaction yet he seemed to be careless of his money which he gave profusely to all he seemed to delight in the society of strangers and therefore sought ours but huldebrand not speaking his language did not gain the same hold of his affections as myself he indeed treated me completely as his son and often directed me in the conduct of our concerns his advice was always advantageous this stranger seemed to look upon me as his pupil and he gradually turned my mind to the objects around me but be did not improve my heart by the opening of my mind he was himself extremely rich when therefore he held forth upon the happiness of contented poverty i thought he was but a mere visionary imagining the arabian delights of a sandy desert while shaded by the canopying foliage of a grove and surrounded by all the riches of a cultivated country i looked around and i saw the genius and the ideot both equally subservient to the will of the wealthy i saw virtue trodden under foot and vice that monster in rags in the cottage adored as a goddess in the temples of the gaudy palace wherever i went it seemed as if gold in the bustling of the whole of life had the same eflect as a few aspers thrown amidst the obstreperous crowd that immediately leaves off its hideous yell in haste to scramble for the miserable gain riches were a thirst upon me 1 could not believe that matilda or ernach her father could resist the splendour of wealth but huldebrand was with me half our common property was his he lovedwas beloved whenever i looked upon him my heart did not beat quicker it seemed for a moment to pause as if his sight blasted its vital action but it beat again with redoubled violence when matildas image rose upon my mind and my former vow was again repeated thoughmy appetite for riches was not sated it was gratified ourspeculations had been constantly doubling our capital and we had already left the banks of the euphrates turning our </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> our steps towards europe when we gradually entered the vast desert that spreads its subtle sands from the red sea almost to the mediterranean having all our wealth about us in jewels and gold we were anxious about our safety every night the cry of the watchful sentinel bidding us be upon the alert while it called to the roaming arab to depart sounded on my waking ears and often i arose in painful anxiety to gaze upon the far spread horizon lost sometimes in the misty light of the bright moon i envied the sound sleep of the poor cameldriver who lay extended by the animal entrusted to his care as heedless of my wealth as the brute about the fate of his burden at last the ground seemed to acquire firmness to the foot and the camel already began to browze upon the solitary stunted plants thathere and there spread their parched growth to the no longer beneficent ray of an eastern sun i thought myself secure night came and 1 was standing by my open tent for i could not rest i was gazing upon a long line which bounded the horizon with a thin dark streak indicating the palm boundary to our toilsome pilgrimages there were slight clouds flitting before the moon and as their shadows fled over the vast expanse my heart beat quicker for each as it approached from the horizon seemed to my hurried imagination as the dark shadow formed by an arab troop one the other always bearing deceit with it at last from the long line of palms a black speck seemed to move with great rapidity i could trace no cloud upon tire heavens which could throw its dark shadow upon this track i breathless called a sentinel the alarm was given but we were surrounded i went about like a madman encouraged the men to fight fought the circle was gradually straightened round us the men fell by the distant arrows at first but the work of death was hot slower when the sword clashed against sword and the robbers foot trod upon his antagonists i struggled my riches were lost while yet struggling amidst our very tents i heard the old armenian cry for help he was combating with a young arabian who had thrown him to the ground i rushed forward bade the robber defend himself we fought i succeeded in disarming him and was upon the point of thrusting my sword through his body when he begged of me to spare his life promising that both the armenian and myself should be safe 1 saw all resistance was at an end i gave him back his weapon </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> weapon and approached the old man who was wounded he took my hand thanked me for my attempt to save him but he thought his wound was mortal he bade me at the same time console myself for the loss of my accumulated wealth saying that he would ere he died make me ample amends our lives at the intercession of the arab i had spared who proved to be a man of rank amongst the robbers were granted us he conveyed the armenian to his own tent and i anxiously placed myself by the old mans side watching with the agitation of a desperate gambler every various expression of his countenance it was my last stake huldebrand i knew was not killed but had been given as part of the booty to one of the robbers in hopes of his ransoming himself but he was ruined like myself had lost every thing i was however if not deceived to obtain riches as abundantly as before matilda might then be mine i made no further enquiries about him who had partaken the vicissitudes of commerce and of life with me who had been almost beggared by my rashness and whose steadiness had enabled me to recover every thing and to gain wealth i sat by the old man every sound that fell from his lips seemed the announcement of his bequest but he was silent on that subject five days elapsed at last the sixth was passing and his strength was evidently rapidly failing his breath became hurried and his eyes began to take that lustre which seems to be the last exertion of the departing soul he then spoke i wished he said that my life had been spared but a short time longer i could then have bestowed wealth upon you without the conditions that maynowstartle you know but how dare i tell it you may look upon me with horror and while i am wishing to bless you may turn away from me 1 have a power that is supposed to bring the curse of the almighty upon it j i can i have the power of raising a spirit from the vast abyss and make him lay at my feet the infinite wealth enclo sed within the earths recesses but if you would listen to one aged who has borne this blasting power from early youth you would refuse the dangerous gift for there is a condition necessarily bound to that power which will undoubtedly quell your ardent longing even for riches it was in vain that he addressed me thus matilda and wealth connected rose to my imagination i pressed him to explain himself he did </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> did he told me that either i could only call for a certain sumat a time and thatat each time some human domestic infliction worse than the preceding would fall upon me or that i at once could gain unlimited power and constant domestic prosperity on the condition of giving myself up for ever to the will of a malignant being he had chosen the first had called but once for the exertion of the demons power but his happiness had been withered by that once i did not hesitate i laughed in my own mind at domestic happiness i had lived only in italy and in the east i begged of him to disclose his secret he did i bound myself to the first condition 1 impatiently rose i left the old man upon his dying couch and retreated to my own tent i raised the spirit his hideous form might have appalled a stronger heart than mine i trembled but his mocking laugh subdued my fears and bending my knee i acknowledged him as my superior through life 1 cannot describe the scene i could not without recording some part of the spells by which i raised this monster and he has but too fully proved his power for me to be willing to put the least clue into the hands of any one which might bring the curse i have felt upon him besides riches i gained other powers but these are not connected with yours and my louisas fate i shall not speak of them i returned to the sick mans tent the armenian was dead 1 did not feel sorry how could i at that moment i was exultant my wealth was so enormous i did not see a possibility of spending it the next day the robbers buried my benefaptor iu the burning sands i proposed a ransom for myself to the arab he insisted upon my accepting my freedom i did and we eat together no longer fearing treachery i made him a present to an enormous amount he was surprised but did not make even the smallest enquiry i roamed bout the encampment for i was desirous of seeing these robbers in their native barren plain while wander ing about their black tents i heard a voice of pain issuing from one of the most miserable it was huldebrand he was calling in the delirium of a fever for a drop of water to allay his thirst the well was close to me the tent was open no one was near he was extended upon the sandy floor with hardly any clothes to defend him from its hot touch i even i could </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> could not resist this appeal i seized a vessel lying by his side and drew it from the well fbll 1 was turning towards him when suddenly his tones altered he seemed to press his breast while in the softest words he addressed some one i approached he was imagining matilda stood by him the words sounded on my ear i know matilda that you love me the pitcher fell upon the sand and the water was drank up by the burning dust and 1 turned away with a raging heart from the dying huldehrand i instantly determined upon leaving the spot the noble arab escorted me to the utmost boundary of the desert and i was safe from danger i hired camels and horses and proceeded to aleppo spreading every where that i was a merchant who had been very successful in ray speculations this was easy to me for i could refer to people with whom i had had transactions and my name was known i hastened to italy and soon reached milan 1 entered with all the pomp of riches i will not describe my entry it was foolishly splendid nor will i attempt to paint to you the daily display i made of some new folly j they were pro duced by tbe intoxication of a madman matilda for she held no less a powerful influence over me than my avarice was the object of the whole i found her health much decayed she had not heard of huldebrand for more than two years yet there was perhaps a greater charm in that pale cheek and languid eye than i had found in the delicate colouring of the one or the splendour of the other if i could gain her love now it would indeed be an ample compensation for her former rejection i began byspreading the report of her lovers death though i was not certain of the fact yet i thought at any rate that he could not reappear so soon as not to allow me time to accomplish nay epd i then went to her fathers and in the course of the conversation announced it matilda was inconsolable but she took pleasure in my society for i could talk to her of huldebrand i related indifferent particulars concerning him the eager ness with which she listened reached my heart i determined however to endure even these pangs rather than lose the opportunities afforded me of sitting by her side as in the course of narratipn i introduced the relation of actions in which i had been his benefactor she blessed me for it i felt like a baffled demon i gradually began to talk </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> talk of myself i sounded the father and mother with regard to a marriage obtained their full consent and approbation they gradually broke it to their daughter she wondered at my seeking for a widowed heart insisted upon my taking some months to consider of it while she herself fulfilled the term of mourning she thought due to her lovers memory i was anxious and fearful of huldebrands appearance i pressed my suit with earnestness j my relations her father her mother used all the arts of persuasion to induce her to anticipate the day she did and we werg married it now seemed as if i could dare the world i had matilda had wealth the only objects my mind had ever rested upon were mine i had two children louisa and olivieri you cannot imagine the splendour in which i lived where could the mortal be found who had greater supposed sources of happiness than mine yet i was miserable matilda was mine my wife but her affections still rested upon the image of my rival i doated upon her it seemed as if the price of guilt i had paid bound her the more to me as if she were to form the only hap piness i was to know and she did not love me she differed entirely from my countrywomen she enjoyed her domestic circle she was modest and while she stood amongst the abandoned wantons who formed the only society around her she stood erect as if she were sent by heaven to show deluded men the beauties of the virtues they despised i had not enjoyed the society of my wife more then three years when my momentary happiness was masted matilda came home one day as i imagined from the corse flamed and violently agitated she threw herself upon the sofa and lost in thought she did not perceive that i was near her she drew from her breast a note i could see over her shoulder it struck me that it was huldebrands handwriting she seemed to look upon it as if she could not believe her eyes she viewed it her hands fell and the movementofthe eyelids over the fixed eyes seemed to denote the belief in a deceit of the senses her breath was still hercheek pale she did not move i unavoidably discovered myself she turned looked at me and the tears bursting from her eyes rolled down her cheeks as she rubbed out of the room i dared not follow her huldebrand plight be stalking inmy very house might be close to me his itords of reproach might be already in the air prepared to damn me with </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> with their sound i should be proved in the worlds face a liar a wretch without a spark of generosity of gratitude in matildas face i hid myself in my chamber for the consciousness of my guilt caused me at first to wish for concealment but the thought of my rival roused me was it not possible to remove him i rushed out of my room and was upon the point of going through the great gate when i perceived a figure descending the staircase wrapt closely in a large mantle it was a woman it was matilda her hurried step and anxious glances thrown around caused me to watch her she went out into the street i followed her there was an obstacle near the theatre she cleared it but i lost her in the crowd of carriages in vain i tried every opening leading to the theatre i could not recover a trace of her at last i was obliged to lean exhausted against the wall and ernach her father coming from the theatre discovered me perceiving my agitation at sight of him he insisted upon escorting me home he attempted to lead me to explain to him the cause of my trembling limbs which weighed upon his arm he did not know that he sought to know my shame j i insisted upon his leaving me and i at last fell exhausted upon a chair in my saloon i know not how long i had remained in this situation by myself i at last heard matildas light step ascending the staircase i did not move my eyes remained still gazing on the ground when she entered at sight of me she started but she commanded herself approached me with a faultering step i attempted to clasp her to my bosom as if i know not what passed in my mind she retreated you have aright to know where i have been in this clandestine manner i hid my face with my hands i was conscious she had been to see huldebrand she had been with him she would say no more i threw myself at her feet she turned away i can no longer even esteem you were the last words she said when she left me she went out several times in the course of next dayj once i attempted to follow her she perceived me at the door filiberto she said seek notto pursue my steps i am but active in the cause of virtue retire and leave me you must be aware of what hangs over your head would that heaven may grant i could avert it from my husband my childrens father i was </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> was left in a state of mind that bordered upon phrenzy i rushed out of the house and turning my steps another way i did not return to wards my home till night when i did return i found every thing in the greatest confusion there was a carriage with posthomes at the gate the moment i approached my valet came to me to tell me of my shame matilda had been seen leaving milan with a gentleman in her company i jumped into the carriage and followed upon the road they were reported to have taken i did not speak during the whole time i did not listen though my servant having entered with me was telling me mere of the circumstances night and day i travelled in pursuit i seemed to be gaining on them i at last overtook them just as 1 was entering a village in savoy they were upon the point of leaving it i sprung out of my carriage and with the speed of a demoniac i ran after them> in my furious haste i fell i did not attempt to rise but instantly fired my wifes shriek was heard they however drove on when my carriage with fresh horses overtook me my servant tried to raise me i had dislocated my ancle blood my servant told me could be traced upon the roach as if it had fallen from my wifes carriage i could but look upon myself as matildas murderer the shriek was hers my emotions and feelings were so violent and various it would be impossible to portray them the demons power was upon me and his curse proved a bitter one i was conveyed home where i was for a long time delirious i became calm but not less miserable my attendants then gave me a letter which had been found upon my wifes dressing table after my departure in chase of her she was innocent she had not fled with huldebraud but with her father huldebrand had upon that condition agreed to conceal my crime my shame she had left her home her children had sacrificed her own to shield my name from infamy i did not at this intelligence relapse into the violent ravings i had undergone i sunk into a state of apathy whence nothing could rouse me i refused even to see my children and hardly ever leaving my chamber i spent the night and day with short intervals to selfreproach in combat ing inflictions of the mind more dreadful than any corporeal penance of the holy anchorite many years had thus passed i had not once seen my children not even heard of them for i </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> i would speak with no one i at last saw them by accident you know olivieris violent character he had constantly enquired after me always baffled by the servants in his wish of seeing me he at last seized his opportunity but louisa had watched him and they both appeared in my sight struggling with one another for she was trying to hinder his disturbing me if matilda herself had stood before me she could not have affected me more for louisa though her features are different her eye dark has the expression that gave such power to her niothers looks playing upon her face she at last no longer capable of resisting her brother threw herself at my feet and earnestly begged me not to be offended with her dear olivieri i took her to my arms from that moment i was aroused i could not leave my daughter but gave up all my time to the education of my children but i brought another curse upon my bead for i neglected olivieri except in his literary studies i did not assist him his mind was allowed to be biassed by any one who chose to trouble themselves with acting upon him louisa on the contrary was my constant companion she rewarded my care you know her if ever a wretch like me might have hope it must be in the prayers such a being can offer up for me to the throne of heaven after some time i proposed journeying through the different countries of europe to show my children the different peculiarities of nations we had already entered switzerland when my son left me i had been accustomed to his often quitting me for days together and hardly noticed his departure louisa and myself proceeded to the different spots remarkable for their beauty or sublimity on the wengern alp we saw you we soon after heard daily of the feats of emestus berchtold arid olivieri i dont know why but the thought of the chamois hunter we had seen being this ernestus first struck my daughter and i soon joined in the belief a letter from olivieri appointed interlaken as the place of meeting we went there events in which you were concerned brought us again to milaq the immense riches i had obtained from the spirit under my command though much diminished were yet more than sufficient to maintain us in sufficient splendour not to fear any thing like a competition but olivieri and yourself were gamblers louisa forced me again to risk an infliction equally severe as the last for your sake i could not resist her prayers for you i again called the spirit from </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> from his immortal haunts and olivieris infamy was the consequence your debts had proved so enormous that id attempt at saving him from an ignominious death i was again obliged though i knew the horrible powers of the demdn to call upon him i did so he announced to me that i had exhausted my spells and that after this infliction as nothing round me would remain on which he could breathe his pestilential breath he would no longer obey my summons i called upon him to take back his gold he laughed and left me i had no suspicion of olivieris seduction of your sister when therefore his letter was put into my hands you may imagine how your noble conduct affected me i did not speak of it for what could a father say must i even acknowledge it to you i sometimes rested upon it with a feeling of consolation for i hoped that crime of my sons might be the infliction upon his father meant by the demon as passing all others louisa i thought might then be spared and you two might at least be happy but you married i dreamt of happiness on louisas birthday accompanied you to your room and the demons threat i found had indeed been fulfilled your mothers portrait was matildas olivieri had seduced you married a daughter of matilda of matildas husband and i was the murderer of her father the end </chapter> </lowSuspense1>
