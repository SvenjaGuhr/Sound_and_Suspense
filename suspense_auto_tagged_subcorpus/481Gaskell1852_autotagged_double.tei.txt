 <lowSuspense4>you know my dears that your mother was an orphan and an only child and i daresay you have heard that your grandfather was a clergyman up in westmoreland where i come from i was just a girl in the village school when </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> when one day your grandmother came in to ask the mistress if there was any scholar there who would do for a nursemaid and mighty proud i was i can tell ye when the mistress called me up and spoke of me being a good girl at my needle and a steady honest girl and one whose parents were very respectable though they might be poor i thought i should like nothing better than to serve the pretty young lady who was blushing as deep as i was as she spoke of the coming baby and what </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> what i should have to do with it however i see you dont care so much for this part of my story as for what you think is to come so ill tell you at once i was engaged and settled at the parsonage before miss rosamond that was the baby who is now your mother was born to be sure i had little enough to do with her when she came for she was never out of her mothers arms and slept by her all night long and proud enough was i sometimes when missis trusted </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense4> trusted her to me there never was such a baby before or since though youve all of you been fine enough in your turns but for sweet winning ways youve none of you come up to your mother she took after her mother who was a real lady born a miss furnivall a granddaughter of lord furnivalls in northumberland i believe she had neither brother nor sister and had been brought up in my lords family till she had married your grandfather who was just a curate son to a shopkeeper in carlislebut a clever fine gentleman </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> gentleman as ever wasand one who was a rightdown hard worker in his parish which was very wide and scattered all abroad over the westmoreland fells when your mother little miss rosamond was about four or five years old both her parents died in a fortnightone after the other ah that was a sad time my pretty young mistress and me was looking for another baby when my master came home from one of his long rides wet and tired and took the fever he died of and then she never held up her head again but </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> but just lived to see her dead baby and have it laid on her breast before she sighed away her life my mistress had asked me on her deathbed never to leave miss rosamond but if she had never spoken a word i would have gone with the little child to the end of the world the next thing and before we had well stilled our sobs the executors and guardians came to settle the affairs they were my poor young mistresss own cousin lord furnivall and mr esthwaite my masters brother a shopkeeper in manchester not </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> not so well to do then as he was afterwards and with a large family rising about him well i dont know if it were their settling or because of a letter my mistress wrote on her deathbed to her cousin my lord but somehow it was settled that miss rosamond and me were to go to furnivall manor house in northumberland and my lord spoke as if it had been her mothers wish that she should live with his family and as if he had no objections for that one or two more or less could </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> could make no difference in so grand a household so though that was not the way in which i should have wished the coming of my bright and pretty pet to have been looked atwho was like a sunbeam in any family be it never so grandi was well pleased that all the folks in the dale should stare and admire when they heard i was going to be young ladys maid at my lord furnivalls at furnivall manor but i made a mistake in thinking we were to go and live where my lord did it </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> it turned out that the family had left furnivall manor house fifty years or more i could not hear that my poor young mistress had never been there though she had been brought up in the family and i was sorry for that for i should have liked miss rosamonds youth to have passed where her mothers had been my lords gentleman from whom i asked as many questions as i durst said that the manor house was at the foot of the cumberland fells and a very grand place that an old miss furnivall a greataunt </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> greataunt of my lords lived there with only a few servants but that it was a very healthy place and my lord had thought that it would suit miss rosamond very well for a few years and that her being there might perhaps amuse his old aunt i was bidden by my lord to have miss rosamonds things ready by a certain day he was a stern proud man as they say all the lords furnivall were and he never spoke a word more than was necessary folk did say he had loved my young mistress but </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> but that because she knew that his father would object she would never listen to him and married mr esthwaite but i dont know he never married at any rate but he never took much notice of miss rosamond which i thought he might have done if he had cared for her dead mother he sent his gentleman with us to the manor house telling him to join him at newcastle that same evening so there was no great length of time for him to make us known to all the strangers before he too shook us </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> us off and we were left two lonely young things i was not eighteen in the great old manor house it seems like yesterday that we drove there we had left our own dear parsonage very early and we had both cried as if our hearts would break though we were travelling in my lords carriage which i thought so much of once and now it was long past noon on a september day and we stopped to change horses for the last time at a little smoky town all full of colliers and miners miss rosamond </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> rosamond had fallen asleep but mr henry told me to waken her that she might see the park and the manor house as we drove up i thought it rather a pity but i did what he bade me for fear he should complain of me to my lord we had left all signs of a town or even a village and were then inside the gates of a large wild parknot like the parks here in the south but with rocks and the noise of running water and gnarled thorntrees and old oaks all white and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> and peeled with age the road went up about two miles and then we saw a great and stately house with many trees close around it so close that in some places their branches dragged against the walls when the wind blew and some hung broken down for no one seemed to take much charge of the placeto lop the wood or to keep the mosscovered carriageway in order only in front of the house all was clear the great oval drive was without a weed and neither tree nor creeper was allowed to grow over the </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> the long manywindowed front at both sides of which a wing protected which were each the ends of other side fronts for the house although it was so desolate was even grander than i expected behind it rose the fells which seemed unenclosed and bare enough and on the left hand of the house as you stood facing it was a little oldfashioned flowergarden as i found out afterwards a door opened out upon it from the west front it had been scooped out of the thick dark wood for some old lady furnivall but the branches </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> branches of the great foresttrees had grown and overshadowed it again and there were very few flowers that would live there at that time when we drove up to the great front entrance and went into the hall i thought we would be lostit was so large and vast and grand there was a chandelier all of bronze hung down from the middle of the ceiling and i had never seen one before and looked at it all in amaze then at one end of the hall was a great fireplace as large as the sides of </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> of the houses in my country with massy andirons and dogs to hold the wood and by it were heavy oldfashioned sofas at the opposite end of the hall to the left as you went inon the western sidewas an organ built into the wall and so large that it filled up the best part of that end beyond it on the same side was a door and opposite on each side of the fireplace were also doors leading to the east front but those i never went through as long as i stayed in the house </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> house so i cant tell you what lay beyond the afternoon was closing in and the hall which had no fire lighted in it looked dark and gloomy but we did not stay there a moment the old servant who had opened the door for us bowed to mr henry and took us in through the door at the further side of the great organ and led us through several smaller halls and passages into the west drawingroom where he said that miss furnivall was sitting poor little miss rosamond held very tight to me as if </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> if she were scared and lost in that great place and as for myself i was not much better the west drawingroom was very cheerfullooking with a warm fire in it and plenty of good comfortable furniture about miss furnivall was an old lady not far from eighty i should think but i do not know she was thin and tall and had a face as full of fine wrinkles as if they had been drawn all over it with a needles point her eyes were very watchful to make up i suppose for her being so </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> so deaf as to be obliged to use a trumpet sitting with her working at the same great piece of tapestry was mrs stark her maid and companion and almost as old as she was she had lived with miss furnivall ever since they both were young and now she seemed more like a friend than a servant she looked so cold and grey and stony as if she had never loved or cared for any one and i dont suppose she did care for any one except her mistress and owing to the great deafness of </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> of the latter mrs stark treated her very much as if she were a child mr henry gave some message from my lord and then he bowed goodby to us alltaking no notice of my sweet little miss rosamonds outstretched handand left us standing there being looked at by the two old ladies through their spectacles i was right glad when they rung for the old footman who had shown us in at first and told him to take us to our rooms so we went out of that great drawingroom and into another sittingroom and out </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> out of that and then up a great flight of stairs and along a broad gallerywhich was something like a library having books all down one side and windows and writingtables all down the othertill we came to our rooms which i was not sorry to hear were just over the kitchens for i began to think i should be lost in that wilderness of a house there was an old nursery that had been used for all the little lords and ladies long ago with a pleasant fire burning in the grate and the kettle boiling </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> boiling on the hob and teathings spread out on the table and out of that room was the nightnursery with a little crib for miss rosamond close to my bed and old james called up dorothy his wife to bid us welcome and both he and she were so hospitable and kind that byandby miss rosamond and me felt quite at home and by the time tea was over she was sitting on dorothys knee and chattering away as fast as her little tongue could go i soon found out that dorothy was from westmoreland and that </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> that bound her and me together as it were and i would never wish to meet with kinder people than were old james and his wife james had lived pretty nearly all his life in my lords family and thought there was no one so grand as they he even looked down a little on his wife because till he had married her she had never lived in any but a farmers household but he was very fond of her as well he might be they had one servant under them to do all the rough work </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> work agnes they called her and she and me and james and dorothy with miss furnivall and mrs stark made up the family always remembering my sweet little miss rosamond i used to wonder what they had done before she came they thought so much of her now kitchen and drawingroom it was all the same the hard sad miss furnivall and the cold mrs stark looked pleased when she came fluttering in like a bird playing and pranking hither and thither with a continual murmur and pretty prattle of gladness i am sure they were sorry </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> sorry many a time when she flitted away into the kitchen though they were too proud to ask her to stay with them and were a little surprised at her taste though to be sure as mrs stark said it was not to be wondered at remembering what stock her father had come of the great old rambling house was a famous place for little miss rosamond she made expeditions all over it with me at her heels all except the east wing which was never opened and whither we never thought of going but in the </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> the western and northern part was many a pleasant room full of things that were curiosities to us though they might not have been to people who had seen more the windows were darkened by the sweeping boughs of the trees and the ivy which had overgrown them but in the green gloom we could manage to see old china jars and carved ivory boxes and great heavy books and above all the old pictures once i remember my darling would have dorothy go with us to tell us who they all were for they were all </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> all portraits of some of my lords family though dorothy could not tell us the names of every one we had gone through most of the rooms when we came to the old state drawingroom over the hall and there was a picture of miss furnivall or as she was called in those days miss grace for she was the younger sister such a beauty she must have been but with such a set proud look and such scorn looking out of her handsome eyes with her eyebrows just a little raised as if she wondered how </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> how anyone could have the impertinence to look at her and her lip curled at us as we stood there gazing she had a dress on the like of which i had never seen before but it was all the fashion when she was young a hat of some soft white stuff like beaver pulled a little over her brows and a beautiful plume of feathers sweeping round it on one side and her gown of blue satin was open in front to a quilted white stomacher well to be sure said i when i had gazed </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> gazed my fill flesh is grass they do say but who would have thought that miss furnivall had been such an outandout beauty to see her now yes said dorothy folks change sadly but if what my masters father used to say was true miss furnivall the elder sister was handsomer than miss grace her picture is here somewhere but if i show it you you must never let on even to james that you have seen it can the little lady hold her tongue think you asked she i was not so sure for she was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> was such a little sweet bold openspoken child so i set her to hide herself and then i helped dorothy to turn a great picture that leaned with its face towards the wall and was not hung up as the others were to be sure it beat miss grace for beauty and i think for scornful pride too though in that matter it might be hard to choose i could have looked at it an hour but dorothy seemed half frightened at having shown it to me and hurried it back again and bade me run and </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> and find miss rosamond for that there were some ugly places about the house where she should like ill for the child to go i was a brave highspirited girl and thought little of what the old woman said for i liked hideandseek as well as any child in the parish so off i ran to find my little one as winter drew on and the days grew shorter i was sometimes almost certain that i heard a noise as if someone was playing on the great organ in the hall i did not hear it every </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> every evening but certainly i did very often usually when i was sitting with miss rosamond after i had put her to bed and keeping quite still and silent in the bedroom then i used to hear it booming and swelling away in the distance the first night when i went down to my supper i asked dorothy who had been playing music and james said very shortly that i was a gowk to take the wind soughing among the trees for music but i saw dorothy look at him very fearfully and bessy the kitchenmaid said </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense1> said something beneath her breath and went quite white i saw they did not like my question so i held my peace till i was with dorothy alone when i knew i could get a good deal out of her so the next day i watched my time and i coaxed and asked her who it was that played the organ for i knew that it was the organ and not the wind well enough for all i had kept silence before james but dorothy had had her lesson ill warrant and never a word could i </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> i get from her so then i tried bessy though i had always held my head rather above her as i was evened to james and dorothy and she was little better than their servant so she said i must never never tell and if ever i told i was never to say she had told me but it was a very strange noise and she had heard it many a time but most of all on winter nights and before storms and folks did say it was the old lord playing on the great organ in </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> in the hall just as he used to do when he was alive but who the old lord was or why he played and why he played on stormy winter evenings in particular she either could not or would not tell me well i told you i had a brave heart and i thought it was rather pleasant to have that grand music rolling about the house let who would be the player for now it rose above the great gusts of wind and wailed and triumphed just like a living creature and then it fell to </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> to a softness most complete only it was always music and tunes so it was nonsense to call it the wind i thought at first that it might be miss furnivall who played unknown to bessy but one day when i was in the hall by myself i opened the organ and peeped all about it and around it as i had done to the organ in crosthwaite church once before and i saw it was all broken and destroyed inside though it looked so brave and fine and then though it was noonday my flesh began </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> began to creep a little and i shut it up and run away pretty quickly to my own bright nursery and i did not like hearing the music for some time after that any more than james and dorothy did all this time miss rosamond was making herself more and more beloved the old ladies liked her to dine with them at their early dinner james stood behind miss furnivalls chair and i behind miss rosamonds all in state and after dinner she would play about in a corner of the great drawingroom as still as any </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> any mouse while miss furnivall slept and i had my dinner in the kitchen but she was glad enough to come to me in the nursery afterwards for as she said miss furnivall was so sad and mrs stark so dull but she and i were merry enough and byandby i got not to care for that weird rolling music which did one no harm if we did not know where it came from that winter was very cold in the middle of october the frosts began and lasted many many weeks i remember one day at </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> at dinner miss furnivall lifted up her sad heavy eyes and said to mrs stark i am afraid we shall have a terrible winter in a strange kind of meaning way but mrs stark pretended not to hear and talked very loud of something else my little lady and i did not care for the frost not we as long as it was dry we climbed up the steep brows behind the house and went up on the fells which were bleak and bare enough and there we ran races in the fresh sharp air and once </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense2> once we came down by a new path that took us past the two old gnarled hollytrees which grew about halfway down by the east side of the house but the days grew shorter and shorter and the old lord if it was he played away more and more stormily and sadly on the great organ one sunday afternoonit must have been towards the end of novemberi asked dorothy to take charge of little missy when she came out of the drawingroom after miss furnivall had had her nap for it was too cold to take her </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> her with me to church and yet i wanted to go and dorothy was glad enough to promise and was so fond of the child that all seemed well and bessy and i set off very briskly though the sky hung heavy and black over the white earth as if the night had never fully gone away and the air though still was very biting and keen we shall have a fall of snow said bessy to me and sure enough even while we were in church it came down thick in great large flakesso thick it </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> it almost darkened the windows it had stopped snowing before we came out but it lay soft thick and deep beneath our feet as we tramped home before we got to the hall the moon rose and i think it was lighter thenwhat with the moon and what with the white dazzling snowthan it had been when we went to church between two and three oclock i have not told you that miss furnivall and mrs stark never went to church they used to read the prayers together in their quiet gloomy way they seemed to feel </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> feel the sunday very long without their tapestrywork to be busy at so when i went to dorothy in the kitchen to fetch miss rosamond and take her upstairs with me i did not much wonder when the old woman told me that the ladies had kept the child with them and that she had never come to the kitchen as i had bidden her when she was tired of behaving pretty in the drawingroom so i took off my things and went to find her and bring her to her supper in the nursery but when </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> when i went into the best drawingroom there sat the two old ladies very still and quiet dropping out a word now and then but looking as if nothing so bright and merry as miss rosamond had ever been near them still i thought she might be hiding from me it was one of her pretty waysand that she had persuaded them to look as if they knew nothing about her so i went softly peeping under this sofa and behind that chair making believe i was sadly frightened at not finding her whats the matter hester </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense4> hester said mrs stark sharply i dont know if miss furnivall had seen me for as i told you she was very deaf and she sat quite still idly staring into the fire with her hopeless face im only looking for my little rosy posy replied i still thinking that the child was there and near me though i could not see her miss rosamond is not here said mrs stark she went away more than an hour ago to find dorothy and she too turned and went on looking into the fire my heart sank at </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense4> at this and i began to wish i had never left my darling i went back to dorothy and told her james was gone out for the day but she and me and bessy took lights and went up into the nursery first and then we roamed over the great large house calling and entreating miss rosamond to come out of her hidingplace and not frighten us to death in that way but there was no answer no sound oh said i at last can she have got into the east wing and hidden there but dorothy </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> dorothy said it was not possible for that she herself had never been in there that the doors were always locked and my lords steward had the keys she believed at any rate neither she nor james had ever seen them so i said i would go back and see if after all she was not hidden in the drawingroom unknown to the old ladies and if i found her there i said i would whip her well for the fright she had given me but i never meant to do it well i went back to </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> to the west drawingroom and i told mrs stark we could not find her anywhere and asked for leave to look all about the furniture there for i thought now that she might have fallen asleep in some warm hidden corner but no we lookedmiss furnivall got up and looked trembling all overand she was nowhere there then we set off again every one in the house and looked in all the places we had searched before but we could not find her miss furnivall shivered and shook so much that mrs stark took her back into </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> into the warm drawingroom but not before they had made me promise to bring her to them when she was found welladay i began to think she never would be found when i bethought me to look into the great front court all covered with snow i was upstairs when i looked out but it was such clear moonlight i could see quite plain two little footprints which might be traced from the halldoor and round the corner of the east wing i dont know how i got down but i tugged open the great stiff halldoor </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> halldoor and throwing the skirt of my gown over my head for a cloak i ran out i turned the east corner and there a black shadow fell on the snow but when i came again into the moonlight there were the little footmarks going upup to the fells it was bitter cold so cold that the air almost took the skin off my face as i ran but i ran on crying to think how my poor little darling must be perished and frightened i was within sight of the hollytrees when i saw a shepherd </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> shepherd coming down the hill bearing something in his arms wrapped in his maud he shouted to me and asked me if i had lost a bairn and when i could not speak for crying he bore towards me and i saw my wee bairnie lying still and white and stiff in his arms as if she had been dead he told me he had been up the fells to gather in his sheep before the deep cold of night came on and that under the hollytrees black marks on the hillside where no other bush was </lowSuspense4> <lowSuspense2> was for miles around he had found my little ladymy lambmy queenmy darlingstiff and cold in the terrible sleep which is frostbegotten oh the joy and the tears of having her in my arms once again for i would not let him carry her but took her maud and all into my own arms and held her near my own warm neck and heart and felt the life stealing slowly back again into her little gentle limbs but she was still insensible when we reached the hall and i had no breath for speech we went in </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> in by the kitchendoor bring me the warmingpan said i and i carried her upstairs and began undressing her by the nursery fire which bessy had kept up i called my little lammie all the sweet and playful names i could think ofeven while my eyes were blinded by my tears and at last oh at length she opened her large blue eyes then i put her into her warm bed and sent dorothy down to tell miss furnivall that all was well and i made up my mind to sit by my darlings bedside the livelong </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> livelong night she fell away into a soft sleep as soon as her pretty head had touched the pillow and i watched by her till morning light when she wakened up bright and clearor so i thought at firstand my dears so i think now she said that she had fancied that she should like to go to dorothy for that both the old ladies were asleep and it was very dull in the drawingroom and that as she was going through the west lobby she saw the snow through the high window fallingfallingsoft and steady but </highSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> but she wanted to see it lying pretty and white on the ground so she made her way into the great hall and then going to the window she saw it bright and soft upon the drive but while she stood there she saw a little girl not so old as she was but so pretty said my darling and this little girl beckoned to me to come out and oh she was so pretty and so sweet i could not choose but go and then this other little girl had taken her by the hand and </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> and side by side the two had gone round the east corner now you are a naughty little girl and telling stories said i what would your good mamma that is in heaven and never told a story in her life say to her little rosamond if she heard herand i daresay she doestelling stories indeed hester sobbed out my child im telling you true indeed i am dont tell me said i very stern i tracked you by your footmarks through the snow there were only yours to be seen and if you had had a </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> a little girl to go handinhand with you up the hill dont you think the footprints would have gone along with yours i cant help it dear dear hester said she crying if they did not i never looked at her feet but she held my hand fast and tight in her little one and it was very very cold she took me up the fellpath up to the hollytrees and there i saw a lady weeping and crying but when she saw me she hushed her weeping and smiled very proud and grand and took me </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> me on her knee and began to lull me to sleep and thats all hesterbut that is true and my dear mamma knows it is said she crying so i thought the child was in a fever and pretended to believe her as she went over her storyover and over again and always the same at last dorothy knocked at the door with miss rosamonds breakfast and she told me the old ladies were down in the eating parlour and that they wanted to speak to me they had both been into the nightnursery the evening before </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense3> before but it was after miss rosamond was asleep so they had only looked at hernot asked me any questions i shall catch it thought i to myself as i went along the north gallery and yet i thought taking courage it was in their charge i left her and its they thats to blame for letting her steal away unknown and unwatched so i went in boldly and told my story i told it all to miss furnivall shouting it close to her ear but when i came to the mention of the other little girl </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> girl out in the snow coaxing and tempting her out and willing her up to the grand and beautiful lady by the hollytree she threw her arms upher old and withered armsand cried aloud oh heaven forgive have mercy mrs stark took hold of her roughly enough i thought but she was past mrs starks management and spoke to me in a kind of wild warning and authority hester keep her from that child it will lure her to her death that evil child tell her it is a wicked naughty child then mrs stark hurried me </highSuspense1> <highSuspense4> me out of the room where indeed i was glad enough to go but miss furnivall kept shrieking out oh have mercy wilt thou never forgive it is many a long year ago i was very uneasy in my mind after that i durst never leave miss rosamond night or day for fear lest she might slip off again after some fancy or other and all the more because i thought i could make out that miss furnivall was crazy from their odd ways about her and i was afraid lest something of the same kind which </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> which might be in the family you know hung over my darling and the great frost never ceased all this time and whenever it was a more stormy night than usual between the gusts and through the wind we heard the old lord playing on the great organ but old lord or not wherever miss rosamond went there i followed for my love for her pretty helpless orphan was stronger than my fear for the grand and terrible sound besides it rested with me to keep her cheerful and merry as beseemed her age so we played </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> played together and wandered together here and there and everywhere for i never dared to lose sight of her again in that large and rambling house and so it happened that one afternoon not long before christmasday we were playing together on the billiardtable in the great hall not that we knew the right way of playing but she liked to roll the smooth ivory balls with her pretty hands and i liked to do whatever she did and byandby without our noticing it it grew dusk indoors though it was still light in the open air </lowSuspense2> <highSuspense1> air and i was thinking of taking her back into the nursery when all of a sudden she cried out look hester look there is my poor little girl out in the snow i turned towards the long narrow windows and there sure enough i saw a little girl less than my miss rosamonddressed all unfit to be outofdoors such a bitter nightcrying and beating against the windowpanes as if she wanted to be let in she seemed to sob and wail till miss rosamond could bear it no longer and was flying to the door to </highSuspense1> <highSuspense3> to open it when all of a sudden and close upon us the great organ pealed out so loud and thundering it fairly made me tremble and all the more when i remembered me that even in the stillness of that deadcold weather i had heard no sound of little battering hands upon the windowglass although the phantom child had seemed to put forth all its force and although i had seen it wail and cry no faintest touch of sound had fallen upon my ears whether i remembered all this at the very moment i do </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> do not know the great organ sound had so stunned me into terror but this i know i caught up miss rosamond before she got the halldoor opened and clutched her and carried her away kicking and screaming into the large bright kitchen where dorothy and agnes were busy with their mincepies what is the matter with my sweet one cried dorothy as i bore in miss rosamond who was sobbing as if her heart would break she wont let me open the door for my little girl to come in and shell die if she is </highSuspense4> <lowSuspense1> is out on the fells all night cruel naughty hester she said slapping me but she might have struck harder for i had seen a look of ghastly terror on dorothys face which made my very blood run cold shut the backkitchen door fast and bolt it well said she to agnes she said no more she gave me raisins and almonds to quiet miss rosamond but she sobbed about the little girl in the snow and would not touch any of the good things i was thankful when she cried herself to sleep in bed then </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> then i stole down to the kitchen and told dorothy i had made up my mind i would carry my darling back to my fathers house in applethwaite where if we lived humbly we lived at peace i said i had been frightened enough with the old lords organplaying but now that i had seen for myself this little moaning child all decked out as no child in the neighbourhood could be beating and battering to get in yet always without any sound or noisewith the dark wound on its right shoulder and that miss rosamond had </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> had known it again for the phantom that had nearly lured her to her death which dorothy knew was true i would stand it no longer i saw dorothy change colour once or twice when i had done she told me she did not think i could take miss rosamond with me for that she was my lords ward and i had no right over her and she asked me would i leave the child that i was so fond of just for sounds and sights that could do me no harm and that they had all </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> all had to get used to in their turns i was all in a hot trembling passion and i said it was very well for her to talk that knew what these sights and noises betokened and that had perhaps had something to do with the spectre child while it was alive and i taunted her so that she told me all she knew at last and then i wished i had never been told for it only made me more afraid than ever she said she had heard the tale from old neighbours that were alive </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense1> alive when she was first married when folks used to come to the hall sometimes before it had got such a bad name on the country side it might not be true or it might what she had been told the old lord was miss furnivalls fathermiss grace as dorothy called her for miss maude was the elder and miss furnivall by rights the old lord was eaten up with pride such a proud man was never seen or heard of and his daughters were like him no one was good enough to wed them although they </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> they had choice enough for they were the great beauties of their day as i had seen by their portraits where they hung in the state drawingroom but as the old saying is pride will have a fall and these two haughty beauties fell in love with the same man and he no better than a foreign musician whom their father had down from london to play music with him at the manor house for above all things next to his pride the old lord loved music he could play on nearly every instrument that ever was </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> was heard of and it was a strange thing it did not soften him but he was a fierce dour old man and had broken his poor wifes heart with his cruelty they said he was mad after music and would pay any money for it so he got this foreigner to come who made such beautiful music that they said the very birds on the trees stopped their singing to listen and by degrees this foreign gentleman got such a hold over the old lord that nothing would serve him but that he must come every </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> every year and it was he that had the great organ brought from holland and built up in the hall where it stood now he taught the old lord to play on it but many and many a time when lord furnivall was thinking of nothing but his fine organ and his finer music the dark foreigner was walking abroad in the woods with one of the young ladies now miss maude and then miss grace miss maude won the day and carried off the prize such as it was and he and she were married all </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> all unknown to any one and before he made his next yearly visit she had been confined of a little girl at a farmhouse on the moors while her father and miss grace thought she was away at doncaster races but though she was a wife and a mother she was not a bit softened but as haughty and as passionate as ever and perhaps more so for she was jealous of miss grace to whom her foreign husband paid a deal of courtby way of blinding heras he told his wife but miss grace triumphed over </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense2> over miss maude and miss maude grew fiercer and fiercer both with her husband and with her sister and the formerwho could easily shake off what was disagreeable and hide himself in foreign countrieswent away a month before his usual time that summer and halfthreatened that he would never come back again meanwhile the little girl was left at the farmhouse and her mother used to have her horse saddled and gallop wildly over the hills to see her once every week at the very least for where she loved she loved and where she hated she </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense2> she hated and the old lord went on playingplaying on his organ and the servants thought the sweet music he made had soothed down his awful temper of which dorothy said some terrible tales could be told he grew infirm too and had to walk with a crutch and his sonthat was the present lord furnivalls fatherwas with the army in america and the other son at sea so miss maude had it pretty much her own way and she and miss grace grew colder and bitterer to each other every day till at last they hardly </lowSuspense2> <lowSuspense1> hardly ever spoke except when the old lord was by the foreign musician came again the next summer but it was for the last time for they led him such a life with their jealousy and their passions that he grew weary and went away and never was heard of again and miss maude who had always meant to have her marriage acknowledged when her father should be dead was left now a deserted wife whom nobody knew to have been married with a child that she dared not own although she loved it to distraction living </lowSuspense1> <lowSuspense1> living with a father whom she feared and a sister whom she hated when the next summer passed over and the dark foreigner never came both miss maude and miss grace grew gloomy and sad they had a haggard look about them though they looked handsome as ever but byandby maude brightened for her father grew more and more infirm and more than ever carried away by his music and she and miss grace lived almost entirely apart having separate rooms the one on the west side miss maude on the eastthose very rooms which were now </lowSuspense1> <highSuspense3> now shut up so she thought she might have her little girl with her and no one need ever know except those who dared not speak about it and were bound to believe that it was as she said a cottagers child she had taken a fancy to all this dorothy said was pretty well known but what came afterwards no one knew except miss grace and mrs stark who was even then her maid and much more of a friend to her than ever her sister had been but the servants supposed from words that were </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> were dropped that miss maude had triumphed over miss grace and told her that all the time the dark foreigner had been mocking her with pretended lovehe was her own husband the colour left miss graces cheek and lips that very day for ever and she was heard to say many a time that sooner or later she would have her revenge and mrs stark was for ever spying about the east rooms one fearful night just after the new year had come in when the snow was lying thick and deep and the flakes were still </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> still fallingfast enough to blind any one who might be out and abroadthere was a great and violent noise heard and the old lords voice above all cursing and swearing awfully and the cries of a little child and the proud defiance of a fierce woman and the sound of a blow and a dead stillness and moans and wailings dying away on the hillside then the old lord summoned all his servants and told them with terrible oaths and words more terrible that his daughter had disgraced herself and that he had turned her out of </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> of doorsher and her childand that if ever they gave her help or food or shelter he prayed that they might never enter heaven and all the while miss grace stood by him white and still as any stone and when he had ended she heaved a great sigh as much as to say her work was done and her end was accomplished but the old lord never touched his organ again and died within the year and no wonder for on the morrow of that wild and fearful night the shepherds coming down the fell side </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> side found miss maude sitting all crazy and smiling under the hollytrees nursing a dead child with a terrible mark on its right shoulder but that was not what killed it said dorothy it was the frost and the cold every wild creature was in its hole and every beast in its fold while the child and its mother were turned out to wander on the fells and now you know all and i wonder if you are less frightened now i was more frightened than ever but i said i was not i wished miss rosamond </lowSuspense4> <highSuspense3> rosamond and myself well out of that dreadful house for ever but i would not leave her and i dared not take her away but oh how i watched her and guarded her we bolted the doors and shut the windowshutters fast an hour or more before dark rather than leave them open five minutes too late but my little lady still heard the weird child crying and mourning and not all we could do or say could keep her from wanting to go to her and let her in from the cruel wind and the snow </highSuspense3> <highSuspense4> snow all this time i kept away from miss furnivall and mrs stark as much as ever i could for i feared themi knew no good could be about them with their grey hard faces and their dreamy eyes looking back into the ghastly years that were gone but even in my fear i had a kind of pity for miss furnivall at least those gone down to the pit can hardly have a more hopeless look than that which was ever on her face at last i even got so sorry for herwho never said a </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> a word but what was quite forced from herthat i prayed for her and i taught miss rosamond to pray for one who had done a deadly sin but often when she came to those words she would listen and start up from her knees and say i hear my little girl plaining and crying very sadoh let her in or she will die one nightjust after new years day had come at last and the long winter had taken a turn as i hopedi heard the west drawingroom bell ring three times which was the signal </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> signal for me i would not leave miss rosamond alone for all she was asleepfor the old lord had been playing wilder than everand i feared lest my darling should waken to hear the spectre child see her i knew she could not i had fastened the windows too well for that so i took her out of her bed and wrapped her up in such outer clothes as were most handy and carried her down to the drawingroom where the old ladies sat at their tapestrywork as usual they looked up when i came in and </highSuspense3> <highSuspense2> and mrs stark asked quite astounded why did i bring miss rosamond there out of her warm bed i had begun to whisper because i was afraid of her being tempted out while i was away by the wild child in the snow when she stopped me short with a glance at miss furnivall and said miss furnivall wanted me to undo some work she had done wrong and which neither of them could see to unpick so i laid my pretty dear on the sofa and sat down on a stool by them and hardened my </highSuspense2> <highSuspense3> my heart against them as i heard the wind rising and howling miss rosamond slept on sound for all the wind blew so miss furnivall said never a word nor looked round when the gusts shook the windows all at once she started up to her full height and put up one hand as if to bid us to listen i hear voices said she i hear terrible screamsi hear my fathers voice just at that moment my darling wakened with a sudden start my little girl is crying oh how she is crying and she tried </highSuspense3> <highSuspense3> tried to get up and go to her but she got her feet entangled in the blanket and i caught her up for my flesh had begun to creep at these noises which they heard while we could catch no sound in a minute or two the noises came and gathered fast and filled our ears we too heard voices and screams and no longer heard the winters wind that raged abroad mrs stark looked at me and i at her but we dared not speak suddenly miss furnivall went towards the door out into the anteroom </highSuspense3> <highSuspense1> anteroom through the west lobby and opened the door into the great hall mrs stark followed and i durst not be left though my heart almost stopped beating for fear i wrapped my darling tight in my arms and went out with them in the hall the screams were louder than ever they seemed to come from the east wingnearer and nearerclose on the other side of the lockedup doorsclose behind them then i noticed that the great bronze chandelier seemed all alight though the hall was dim and that a fire was blazing in the vast </highSuspense1> <highSuspense2> vast hearthplace though it gave no heat and i shuddered up with terror and folded my darling closer to me but as i did so the east door shook and she suddenly struggling to get free from me cried hester i must go my little girl is there i hear her she is coming hester i must go i held her tight with all my strength with a set will i held her if i had died my hands would have grasped her still i was so resolved in my mind miss furnivall stood listening and paid </highSuspense2> <highSuspense4> paid no regard to my darling who had got down to the ground and whom i upon my knees now was holding with both my arms clasped round her neck she still striving and crying to get free all at once the east door gave way with a thundering crash as if torn open in a violent passion and there came into that broad and mysterious light the figure of a tall old man with grey hair and gleaming eyes he drove before him with many a relentless gesture of abhorrence a stern and beautiful woman with </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> with a little child clinging to her dress oh hester hester cried miss rosamond its the lady the lady below the hollytrees and my little girl is with her hester hester let me go to her they are drawing me to them i feel themi feel them i must go again she was almost convulsed by her efforts to get away but i held her tighter and tighter till i feared i should do her a hurt but rather that than let her go towards those terrible phantoms they passed along towards the great halldoor where the </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> the winds howled and ravened for their prey but before they reached that the lady turned and i could see that she defied the old man with a fierce and proud defiance but then she quailedand then she threw up her arms wildly and piteously to save her childher little childfrom a blow from his uplifted crutch and miss rosamond was torn as by a power stronger than mine and writhed in my arms and sobbed for by this time the poor darling was growing faint they want me to go with them on to the fellsthey </highSuspense4> <highSuspense4> fellsthey are drawing me to them oh my little girl i would come but cruel wicked hester holds me very tight but when she saw the uplifted crutch she swooned away and i thanked god for it just at this momentwhen the tall old man his hair streaming as in the blast of a furnace was going to strike the little shrinking childmiss furnivall the old woman by my side cried out oh father father spare the little innocent child but just then i sawwe all sawanother phantom shape itself and grow clear out of the blue </highSuspense4> <highSuspense3> blue and misty light that filled the hall we had not seen her till now for it was another lady who stood by the old man with a look of relentless hate and triumphant scorn that figure was very beautiful to look upon with a soft white hat drawn down over the proud brows and a red and curling lip it was dressed in an open robe of blue satin i had seen that figure before it was the likeness of miss furnivall in her youth and the terrible phantoms moved on regardless of old miss furnivalls </highSuspense3> <lowSuspense4> furnivalls wild entreatyand the uplifted crutch fell on the right shoulder of the little child and the younger sister looked on stony and deadly serene but at that moment the dim lights and the fire that gave no heat went out of themselves and miss furnivall lay at our feet stricken down by the palsydeathstricken yes she was carried to her bed that night never to rise again she lay with her face to the wall muttering low but muttering always alas alas what is done in youth can never be undone in age what is done
