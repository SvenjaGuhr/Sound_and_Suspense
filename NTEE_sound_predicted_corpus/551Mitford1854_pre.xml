1854.

The mere plan of Atherton — the bare
outline of the story — has lain for many-years
in my mind as a book to be written
some day or other, and it would probably
have passed away unexecuted, with other
intentions good or bad, had not a proposal
to gather together, at the same time,
though in a separate form, my dramatic
works, and some short prose tales, brought
this old scheme to my recollection.

My offer to attempt this, the longest
narrative on which I have ventured, was

received with such kind encouragement,
that I was easily induced to undertake the
task.

This occurred at the end of last summer.

Ten months before, I had had a very
severe accident, having been thrown from
my little pony carriage, on the hard gravel
road of a friend's park. Ko bones were
broken ; but the jar had affected every
nerve, and falling upon a highly rheumatic
subject, had left the limbs and body
crippled and powerless. There was, however,
something to be expected from the
great restorer. Time ; and during the
summer, I had been lifted down stairs, and
driven through our beautiful lanes, in hopes
that the blessed air, to which I had been
almost as much accustomed as a gipsy,
would prove a still more effectual remedy.

I3ut the season was peculiarly unfavourable.

I gained no strength. The
autumn found me again confined to my
room ; wheeled with difficulty from the bed
to the fireside; unable to rise from my seat,
to stand for a moment, to put one foot

before another ; and when lifted into bed,
incapable of turning or morning in the
slightest degree whatever. Even in visiting,
I was often obliged to have the ink-glass
held for me, because I could not raise my
hand to dip the pen in the ink.

In this state, with frequent paroxysms
of pain, was the greater part of '• Atherton"
written. It was concluded during a severe
attack of influenza, — concluded because it
lay upon my mind as an engagement to
be fulfilled — a debt to be discharged ; and
there was less risk in the exertion than in
the anxiety.

I have told this story, not so much as an

excuse for faults or shortcomings, since I
well know that the public looks, and hasa
right to look, to the quality of a work,
and not to the circumstances under which
it has been produced ; I tell it as a fact
rather than an apology ; and most surely
not as a complaint. So far, indeed, am I
from murmuring against that Will which
alone knows what is best for us all, that I
cannot be sufficiently thankful to the
merciful Providence which, shattering the
frame, left such poor faculties as were
originally vouchsafed to me, undimmed
and unclouded ; enabling me still to live
by the mind, and not only to enjoy the
never-wearying delight of reading the
thoughts of others, but even to light up
a sick chamber, and brighten a wintry
sky, by recalling the sweet and sunny
valley, which formed one of the most
cherished haunts of my happier years.

The shorter Stories might, I think,
fairly pass for manuscript. They were
written, for the most part, for one of
those costly and splendid Annuals, which
many bought to look at, and few cared to
read. That they were composed to match
the pictures is hardly a disadvantage,
since pictures are often full of suggestions;
but that they were called for
in furious haste, and were sometimes
illustrations of distant ages and distant
countries, was hardly favourable to a
writer so slow and so home-loving as
myself. I would fain have added one or
two of such sketches as used to be
received only too indulgently, but strength
and power have failed me so entirely, that
I have been unable even to correct the
proofs of the later volumes.

And now, gentle reader, health and

farewell.

M. E. Milford.

Stoallowjield, March, 1854.

CHAPTEE I.

THE GREAT FAE:M,

It was about three o'clock on a Xoyeni-
ber afternoon, somewhere about five and
thirty years ago, that an old fashioned
post-chaise, nth one solitary inmate, went
<sound>rumbling</sound> and <sound>jumbling</sound> over the wide verdant
ocean of one of the great downs of
the southern counties. The traveller, a
lean, gaunt, bony man, a good deal on the
shady side of fifty, bore about him in his
acute features, this shrewd eye, a certain

VOL. I. B

formality of demeanour and an occasional
quaintness of phrase, evident marks of his
profession ; and did not need the blue bag
which, flanked by an ancient folio, rested
on the seat beside him, to be at once recognized
for what he really was, a London
solicitor. There was, however, in the
deep and somewhat sad abstraction in
which he leant back in the carnage, evidence
of more personal feelings than those
arising from professional interest ; and he
started, as from a painful dream, when, on
arriving at the top of a hill, or rather on
attaining the extremity of a high tableland,
the postboy suddenly stopped his
horses, and touching his cap, turned round
with the inquiry :

''TotheHaU, sir?"

No ; to the Great Farm."

And, aroused from the dismal thoughts
by which he had been engrossed, Mr.
Langhton addressed himself to the contemplation

of the beautiful landscape before
him.

A most beautiful landscape it was. The
season had been mild, so that the trees
retained much of their foliage, and had
rather gained than lost in richness of
colour ; the dark and uniform verdure of
summer being well exchanged for the
warm hues of autumn, varying from
golden brown to palish yellow, with many a
ruddy gleam from the old thorns, and many
an orange light from the beech-woods,
forming so fine a contrast with the emerald
depths of the grassy valley, and the
purplish tint of the hills. A thrice beautiful
landscape. One of those oases of
cultivation which are occasionally found
amid the great downs of the south of England,
and appear all the richer and more
fertile when embedded in the surrounding
barrenness and sterility.

The road wound down a long declivity

B 2

to a village embosomed in wood, with its
grey eliiircli-tower, its pretty rectory, its
neat cottages and cottage-shops to the old
gables, the beams, stables, ricks, and innumerable
outbuildings of the Great Farm.
Climbing up the opposite hill appeared the
magnificent demesne of Atherton Ilall ;
the park paling overhung with gigantic
trees, bounding the road for upwards of a
mile, its stately lodges, its waters, lawns,
and woods, extending to a chase whose
wild forest scenery was lost in the distance.
Midway the acclivity, the princely mansion,
a fine specimen of the Palladian
architecture which prevailed in England
in the eighteenth century, with its noble
portico'and long colonnades, its broad terraces,
and flight above flight of marble
steps, stood glittering in the wintry light,
as if, like the peacocks sunning themselves
on the balustrade, the very TNalls had a
consciousness of their own proud beauty.

Mr. Langhton had the familiarity of a
native with the scenery, and, himself a
man of refined taste, never looked at it
without pleasure. Xotv, however, as he
gazed at the palace of the proud noble and
the homestead of the tenant, his musings
seemed to become sadder :

'*A strange destiny," thought he, ^^to
carry wealth to one household and poverty
to another; misery, perhaps to both! Well,
it is a lawyer's fate !"

And so thinking he drove up to the door.

There were few houses which wore more
completely the outward show of comfort
and prosperity than the Great Fame at
Atherton. It was a large square substantial
building, with fine fruit-trees covering
the upper part of the walls, and jessamine,
honeysuckle, and China roses clustering
round the windows. The green court,
which divided the house from the road,
was gay dining nine months of the year

with flowers and flowering trees ; and
boasted still some lingering spikes of
hollyhock, a stray blossom of clove and
scarlet geranium, and bunches of that
most fragrant of roses which is called
of the four seasons." The mignonette
too and the violet still mingled their
delicious odours. People who sincerely
love flowers contrive to make them blow
sooner and later than others. "We see
this in the poorest cottages, and here was
no poverty to contend with. On one side
of the court was that most affluent of all
territories, an immense orchard, a perfect
grove of fruit-trees, cherry, apple, pear,
plum, and walnut at their tallest growth
and fullest bearing. Behind was a large
kitchen-garden ; and on the side opposite
to the orchard a magnificent farm-yard, a
huge and indescribable mixture of riches
and mud. Behind that came poultry-yard
and rick-yard, horse-pond and duck-pond,

barns, stables, cart-houses, cow-houses,
dovecots, and piastres, with all-their
inhabitants biped and quadruped,
feathered and unfeathered of every denomination.


They who talk of the <sound>quiet</sound> of the
country can hardly have been in a great
farm-yard, towards sunset on a wintry
day, when the teams are come back from
the plough and the cattle from the field,
and the whole population is gathered
together for the purpose of feeding. I
would match it for <sound>noise</sound> and dirt and
jostling against Cheapside, and taking
into account the variety of the creatures,
and the different keys combined in that
wild chorus, I should have little doubt
of winning.

Lord Delancy, the noble owner of the
Hall, had most extensive estates in the
same county ; but nearly all the parish of
Atherton was rented by the tenant of

the Great Farm, and that tenant was a
woman.

Mrs. Warner had presided over this land
of plenty for nearly fifty years, originally
as the wife of the master, latterly as the
mistress, and always with high reputation
for hospitality and good management.
She was a neat, gentle, lady-like person,
with silver hair, a fair, pale complexion,
mild dark eyes, a little tremor of head
and voice, and a slight bend of the slender
figure ; altogether a most venerable and
beautiful old woman. Her family consisted
of a daughter-in-law, the widow of
her only son, and of their daughter
Catherine, commonly called Katy Warner,
a girl of fifteen.

Katy's mother was a round, rosy, merry,
bustling dame, who having, since the
death of her first husband, had, as she
expressed it, the luck to marry and bury a
second, bore the name of Bell. To her

for some years back the chief government
of the house and farm had devolved, and
few women could be fitter for such a
charge. With a frame strong and active
as that of a man, a competent knowledge
of husbandry, a good judgment in cattle,
and considerable skill in parish impairs;
with a kindness that was always felt and
a tongue that was often heard, she
scolded her way through the agricultural
year from wheat-sowing to harvest. Ignorant
as a new-bon child of the world
and its ways, except always the small bit
of that '' huge rotundity '' called the
manor and royalty of Atherton, it is probable
that the very limitation of her
faculties conduced not a little to her prosperity.
Fearful of experiments, she stuck
to the old routine adapted to her capacity;
and trusted to the experience of
her labourers, men for the most part born
upon the land, who knew every inch of

the ground, and cared for the interest of
their good mistress as if it had been their
own. Everything throve in this female
household, from the flocks whose numbers
were counted by thousands down to
Katy's bees.

The parlour, the common living-room
of the family, was smaller than, to judge
from its appearance, any room in that
house ought to have been, chosen, perhaps,
on that account — people who can command
large rooms having a frequent tendency
to use small ones.

It was a sort of excrescence on one side
of the dwelling, a kind of afterthought,
with a sunny bay-window commanding
the farm-yard, from which it was only
parted by a low paling and a slip of turf,
and giving a peep at the high-road.

A snug and cheerful apartment, after
all, was that little parlour, crowded with
furniture, from the good old lady's high-backed

chair to the low stool on which
Katy, whenever that mercurial little person
did stay five minutes in a place, used
to sit at her grandmother's feet.

In the centre was a small Pembroke
table of dark mahogany, somewhat rickety
; at the end a sideboard of the
same material, the drawers <sound>groaning</sound> withstands
of spirits, and bottles of homemade
wine, the top covered with miscellaneous
articles, Mrs. Warner's large
Bible, surmounted by a cookery-book,
occupying one comer, whilst Mrs. Bell's
enormous work-baskets and work-bags
over-filled the other; a beautiful jar of
dried grasses, Katy's property, occupied
the middle. Katy's possessions, indeed,
might be traced everywhere. Her litter,
living and dead, cumbered the walls and
the floor. Birds, kittens, skipping-ropes,
bridles, riding whips, and battledores
were distributed all over the room, whilst

ATHERTON.

a fat spaniel called Flora lay basking
before the fire.

Two triangular cupboards occupied two
opposite comers; of which one was so
crammed with closely-packed glass and
china that it was dangerous for any unaccustomed
finger to attempt to extricate
cup or saucer from the pile; whilst the
other was filled to bursting with articles
of daily call, tea, sugar, lemons, nutmegs,
and gingerbread. Fruit at all seasons,
and cakes of many denominations completed
the array. ^N'o one could enter that
room without tasting the light seed-cake
diet-bread Mrs. "Warner called it —
compounded from a family recipe a
hundred years old; or the green gooseberry
wine, famous as that of Mrs. Primrose,
sparkling and effervescent as champagne.
It was the very temple of
hospitality.

A side-door opened into a hall which

might, perhaps, lay equal claim to that
title; a large flagged apartment, with a
wide open hearth and a heavy oak table,
on which business of eating and drinking
was going forward all day long. The
materials, it is true, were somewhat different;
consisting not of such kickshaws
as cake and wine, but of solid beef in its
most ponderous form of round and sirloin,
massive bacon, and mighty ale. All the
comers and goers of the Farm paid a visit
to the Stone Hall; and it may be suspected
that they occasionally made an errand for
no better purpose.

At this very moment it was the scene of
a barter betwixt Joseph Stokes, the old
bailiff and factotum, and a west country
dealer, bent to exchange a certain drove of
horned cattle against a flock of Mrs. Warner's
Southron. It was probable that
the day would go against the good bailiff.

The man of beeves, a seasoned vessel,
having declined the home-brewed, and
preferred to drive his bargain over a
pitcher of gin-toddy, which was already
making innovation upon Joseph's brain
unused to such potations.

His mistresses the whilst were assembled
in the common room ; Katy, absorbed by
the witcheries of the '' Ai-arian Nights," a
recent acquisition; Mrs. "Warner nodding
over her knitting, and striving, not very
successfully, to resist the after-dinner nap
of calm and gentle age; Mrs. Well engaged,
with her female prime minister
Eachel, in looking over a stupendous
flasket of clothes, the produce of the great
wash, — such a flasket as might comfortably
have carried the fat knight. Sir John, to
his immortal ducking in Hatchet Mead.
Nothing but long habit could have protected
Mrs. "Warner's slumbers against

the emphatic exclamations of the mistress
at stockings mismatched, snagged tablecloths,
and missing kerchiefs, or the shrill
defences of the maid.

Through the Stone Hall, scarcely noticed
by its trafficking tenants, jugglers upon a
large scale, and into the smaller apartment,
hardly less noisy nth its vociferous housewifery,
good Mr. Langhton made his way,
welcomed as an honoured friend by all its
inmates. Even Flora rose lazily from the
hearth-rug to greet the guest who carried
so kind a heart under so formal a bearing.
Dogs are great penetrates into the hidden
mystery of character. When they wag
their tails, you may be sure either that
there is no deception, or that the deception
is of the rarest and honestest sort, that the
wood beneath is of finer grain than the
outward veneering. Flora set up her long
ears, and wagged her tail in his honour ;
Mrs. Warner pressed his offered hand ;

Katy skipped about him for joy; Mrs.
Bell, jingling her keys, assailed him with
a perfect storm of hospitality ; and Eachel
stood eagerly waiting to execute her
orders.

He put aside her offers with characteristic
decision. "He would have nothing
yet, he thanked her. He had taken something
at the last stage. IS'o dinner; no
wine ; no cakes ; no fruit. He must sleep
at the Hall, where Lord Delancy had appointed
to meet him. He would take
a cup of tea by-and-bye, when they did,
at their usual time. In the meanwhile,
he wished to speak a few words
to Mrs. 'warner."

So the produce of the great wash was
again packed into its huge receptacle,
which Mrs. Well and Eachel shoved with
some difficulty through the door; Katy
picking up odds and ends of clean linen as
they fell from the pile, rolling them into

tight pellets, and tossing them <sound>laughingly</sound>
into the basket as the party disappeared,
pretty much as a schoolboy might have
flung a ball at cricket.

CHAPTEE II.

THE miser's will. ;

^^Katy grows a charming girl," cried the
old lawyer, when left alone with his hostess,
settling himself comfortably on the opposite
side of the bright wood fire. " She is
already taller than her mother, and prettier '
than anything that I have seen this many
a day. That rosy, dimpled, sparkling \
beauty is become very uncommon in Long
don. I suppose she owes her fulness of ;
bloom to your country air and country ;
freedom. There is as perfect evidence of ^
health in those bright hazel eyes, with their
long lashes, and that profusion of shining ;

i

broth curls, as in the glowing cheeks and
ruddy lips, and the white teeth which she
shows as often as she smiles, that is, as
often as she speaks."

'^ She is sunburnt just now'' said grand-mamma,
highly pleased, and wishing to
hear more praises of her darling.

"!N"ot a bit more sunburnt than she
ought to be, as the party lady said of
Wilkes's squint," responded the old lawyer
; ^^ her beauty is only the richer for it.
How old is she ?"

^^ Fifteen last April; a mere child yet,
and I am afraid a spoilt child — wild as a
colt untamed, but good and kind and innocent
and loving, with all her pranks. "Was
ito Katy that you wished to speak to me,
Mr. Langhton ?" asked the old lady, recollecting
herself.

^^ Not exactly, although the subject on
Which I have to speak with you may greatly
influence her future life. Did you ever

hear of a relation of your late husband,
called Eichard Strange? Do you recollect
him?'

'^ Recollect him? truly do I ! !Neither
my husband nor I were so rich in kinsfolk
that we could afford to forget one; and this
Eichard Strange was, I think, the nearest
relation my poor Thomas had. He was
his cousin once removed, having been the
cousin-german of his father. Ay, he was
above a dozen years older than Thomas,
and must be old now — half-way, I should
think, between fourscore and ninety. I
should suppose he must be failing too;
although, when I last saw him, he was
active and hearty — one of those thin and
wiry men who keep their strength long."

^^ You knew him, then ?"

Yes, I have seen him perhaps half a
score times since my man-rage ; the last
time was about fourteen years ago, before
my poor son's death. I remember he was

uiucli taken with. Katy, then a little
toddling thing, just beginning to talk, who
<sound>laughed</sound> and played with him as she did
with everybody. I have never seen him
since, but we commonly hear from him at
Christmas. To say the truth, sir.
Langhton, my husband, who was as kind
a soul as ever lived, used to keep up the
old fashion of sending a basket of country
cheer, turkey, and chine, and such like,
to two or three far-away kinsfolk in London
; and I have continued the custom,
the rather that we know most of them to
be not the best off in the world. Somebody,
indeed, told my daughter that
Eichard Strange, though he did look like
an old beggar, was quite well to do. But
she called upon him in London when she
went there last year about the late Mr.
Bells affairs, and found him living in a
poor way enough. A very poor way by
her account, though she never saw him in

his own place, only in a sort of porter's
lodge. Does he want any thing that we
can do for him, I wonder ? Do you know
him, Mr. Langhton?"

I did know him as intimately, perhaps,
as he chose to be known by anybody. He
is dead. I was his solicitor ; I am now
his executor; and it is about his will,
Mrs. "Warner, that I am come to you. I
am not afraid of overturning a mind so
well-balanced as yours. Did it never
occur to you that there are in the world
such things as misers ? That cousin of
your good husband, Eichard Strange, has
died worth almost two millions of money;
and of that sum, nearly half — quite half,
except moderate legacies to a few charities,
and the still fewer private friends,
that a man who passes his life in money-getting
can hope to acquire — the half of
this sum is bequeathed to the heir's of the
body of his deceased kinsman, Thomas
Warner of Atherton Great Farm."

To Katy ! the only daughter of his
only son ! — to my poor Katy 1" And in
spite of the well-balanced mind which had
been justly imputed to her, the good
grandmother, struck, perhaps, by a transition
in the fate of her simple pet, which
sounded like the conclusion of a fairy-tale,
seemed likely to faint.

*' Ay, dear Mrs. Warner, you may well
look astounded. Take a glass of your
own wine'' said Mr. langton, administering
the cordial. '' You may well be
frightened : it is a terrible destiny to be a
great heiress. But there is health of mind
as well as of body in that bright-eyed
damsel. She will have you to take care
of her, and, in a far less important degree,
she will also have me. And she shall
also, if I see cause for such a measure,
have the Court of Chancery'' added the
good lawyer with a peculiar smile,
" which, with all its faults, and they are

many, does yet extend a very vigilant
protection over its wards, a most comfortable
protection to those who have heiresses
in charge, keeping off fortune-hunters,
and rendering elopements and abductions
unprofitable and unsafe. Ay, we must
keep off fortune-hunters," continued he,
slowly rubbing his hands with an air of
deliberation, as if weighing some important
project, " we must keep off mortimer
But as Katy will have only too
much money of her own, instead of
looking out ourselves for mere wealth, we
must select for her some young man for
whom we can answer ; whose estate and
position will satisfy the world, and whose
character will be a pledge for her happiness.
A fortune of nearly a million is
certainly, according to my views, a great
danger, and therefore a great calamity ;
but there are consolations even for that.
We must look about us."

'^ Or Katy hereafter may look about for
herself," interposed Mrs. Warner. '^ Old
as I am, I have still some faith in a
marriage of affection. With that fortune,
and the prettiness you were talking of, oiu'
little girl may make her own choice."

'' Hem !" quoth the man of law again,
rubbing his hands. '' We may help her,
though. Those love-matches of boys and
girls are not always the happiest. However,
we'll talk of that another time.
These are early days as yet ; for, as you
may well imagine, I took care to inform
you as soon as I had ascertained that there
was no chance, I may say no possibility of
another claimant."

Poor Eichard Strange ! When did he
die ?"

That there is no telling. He lived, if
such an existence can be called living, in
miserable dilapidated chambers, in an out-of-the-way
place called Lyon's Inn. I

myself had never been inside his rooms
until I went thither upon this business.
Frequently as he had occasion to
consult me, he either came to me at my
own office, or appointed to meet me at
some third place ; always contriving to
make the persons with whom he had
dealings, whether they bought estates, or
whether they sold estates ; or whether, as
happened most frequently, they mortgaged
the dirty acres, defray every charge possible.
My bills, always paid by the other
party, were nothing compared with his:
meetings, journeys, consultations, letters
written, letters received, postage, carriage,
loss of time, and when every imaginable
item had been put down, he would add
some unimaginable sum under the head of
sundries. A thorough miser was Eichard
Strange ; Elwes might have taken pattern
from him."

" And was that how he scraped together
so much money ?''

*^ No doubt he began by scraping together
— by mere saving. That was before
my time. But in addition to his
habit of hoarding, which was a veritable
instinct like that of a squirrel or a monkey,
he had immense sagacity in the management
of money — understood the handling
of that delicate machine, called the stocks,
better than any man on 'Change, never
missed a good stroke, never made a bad
one, trafficked in everything, gained by
everything, lost nothing, spent nothing;
so that on the whole, I am rather surprised
that he did not cut up richer."

" Mr. Langhton ! richer !"

Aye ! such will be the general feeling
of the monied world. Everybody will
wonder what he could have done with his
wealth ; though, to be sure, we may find a
good deal more yet ; for he has left us no
list of his property, and we have had little
time to rummage. There may be another

million so far as I know. We shall find
out by degrees. I must inquire amongst
our great capitalists. They may help us''
^^He knew them then?"

" Knew them ! to see the respect paid
to that shabby, dirty old figure when he
entered any of the marts where men of
money congregate ! We are all gold-worshippers
in our great Babylon. Butin
this case they bent before the skill as
well as the metal ; the amasser as well as
the possessor of riches."

*' Poor Eichard Strange !" sighed Mrs.
Warner. "And with all this gold, and
this homage because of his gold, he died,
if I understand you right, alone?"

Alone as he had lived. The portress
of the inn rendered him the little service
that he would permit in his chambers ;
always under his own eye, for he visited
nobody, and received his letters and parcels
at the lodge. An honest, simple

creature sLe was, who, in spite of his
avarice and his suspicions, had a certain
pity for his age, his loneliness, and his
infirmities. The four-score years and
five were beginning to tell upon him fast.
She always called him the poor gentleman.
I am happy to say that he has left her
what will make her comfortable, which, of
course, we should have taken care to do
on Katy's account, if he had not. I mention
it only because it is pleasant that ho
should have done the right thing. There
are good points in most of us, and they
were not wanting in Eichard Strange —
though the crust at the surface was hard
and deep."

'but his death, Mr. Langhton? Tel
me of that ?"

'well, on Monday evening last, as I
was sitting dismally enough, alone in
Norfolk Street, turning over huge masses
of lav papers relating to another acquaintance

of yours, to whom poverty will be a
sorer trial than riches to Katy ; this good
creature, Mrs. Barnes, made her appearance
to announce to me that Mr. Strange
was missing! She came to me, she said,
because he had once ordered her never to
speak about him to any one else ; the
nearest approach to confidence that he
had ever evinced towards any human
being. He had not been seen or heard of
since the preceding Tuesday. Letters
and parcels had arrived ; clerks had calledon
foot, and gentlefolk in coaches; they
had rung the old bell till the wire broke ;
they had <sound>knocked</sound> till they were weary ;
there was no answer to <sound>knock</sound> or <sound>ring</sound> ; no
paper on the door, no <sound>sound</sound> of life in the
chambers. Once before he had been missing
for days, and had come out as if
nothing had happened, only pale and thin.
Another time, he had been gone a
week, when the paper on the door said.

out till six But then he had gone
through the lodge ; and now she was certain
that he had not passed. What should
she do ?"

sand you broke open the door? It
must have been an awful moment !"

And Mrs. Warner laid down her knitting,
and held her spectacles in her trembling
hand.

^^ It was an awful moment. I took with
me my partner, James Osborne, and two
or three other persons well known to poor
Strange ; called in the parish authorities ;
and, after a due course of <sound>knocking</sound> and
<sound>shouting</sound>, proceeded to break open the
door. We were obliged to summon locksmiths
and blacksmiths. The gates of
Newgate were never more strongly barricaded.
It was an awful moment, and a
most fearful sight. The squalidness, the
sordidness, the dirt, the utter destitution
of the miser's home. No sign of coals

in the rusty grate ; not a vestige of food ;
not so much as a cup of water; and the
poor owner of these riches and this
misery, one of the greatest capitalists of
Europe, lying in the midst of the papers
and parchments which represented his
enormous wealth, shrivelled up in a corner,
covered with a rug which a beggar
would have scorned, dead, as it seemed tome,
rather of cold and starvation, than of
sickness or of age. It was a terrible
lesson''

'may Heaven pardon him!'"' And
good Protestant as she was, it may be
suspected that Mrs. Warner inmost
thought was not very unlike a prayer for
the soul of Eichard Strange. Mr. Langton's
next words brought her back to
earth again.

*' Almost the first packet that we discovered
was addressed to mo, and contained
the Will. I had given him several

instructions for such a document many
years ago, and was not at all surprised
to find that Katy came in for nearly half
the property."

'^ You expected this bequest, Mr.
Langhton?"

And you wonder that I did not communicate
my expectations to you ! I thought
such a bequest probable. Eut who could
answer for the caprice of a man so reserved
and so little accessible to ordinary
motives ? He might have endowed a
college or a cat. Would it have been
mise to have entrusted dear Mrs. Bell with
a contingency which her sanguine temper
would have converted into a certainty, and
have proclaimed to every soul in the
parish, from Lord Delancy to Jacob
Stokes ? "

In spite of the tears which had moistened
Mrs. Warner's spectacles, she now lifted
her eyes with a smile in them, which

VOL. I. D

proved low thoroughly she joined in the
good solicitor's estimate of her daughter-in-law's
discretion. Then, with sudden
recollection, she inquired :

And the other half of the property ? "

Ay, there is the real mystery of this
Will. That Eichard Strange should bequeath
great part of his money to the heir
of his nearest kinsman, with whom he had
constantly kept up a sort of intercourse,
that for him might be called amicable, is
natural and proper enough. But the other
half — Did you ever hear your husband
talk of a person called Betsy Brown, in
conjunction with his kinsman ? "

" Never," said Mrs. Warner.

*^I feared so. There must have been
such a person; and the poor heart, that
now lies still and cold in the vaults of
St. Clement's Church, must once have
throbbed with a quickened pulse at the
<sound>sound</sound> of that name. It is a sore puzzle.

Charged, as I said before, with certain
legacies to charities, and to a very few individuals,
the whole property is left to mein
trust, for the heirs of the late Thomas
Warner, of Atherton Great Farm, and
Betsy Brown, formerly of "Weston, her
heirs and assigns. Such names, too ! —
Betsy Brown ! There are a thousand
Elizabeth Browns. Weston ! — There area
hundred Weston. 'None of the few
people who knew my poor client personally,
as a man — not as a trafficker in Loans and
Consols — none of these, and they are few,
can give me the slightest indication as to
the person designated, I must advertise :
indeed, I have already given orders to that
effect, and set the parish clerks to work,
ransacking their registers. If there had
but been spinster tacked to the end, so
that one might have made sure of its being
a maiden name ! But there is not the
slightest clue to the labyrinth. Luckily,"

D 2

added the perplexed lawyer, " the uncertainty
respecting the other legatee will not
interfere with the payment of Katy's
moiety. And here she comes.

CHAPTEE III.

THE HEIRESS.

My queen, low would tou like to bea
great lady?" inquired Mr. Langhton of
the unconscious heiress, using the pet name
by which he was accustomed. to address
her.

"Very much'' replied Katy; every
much, indeed."

"You are reading the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments"' continued Mr. Langton,
glancing at the book, which amongst
its other wonders had kept the little damsel
<sound>quiet</sound> tuning the whole afternoon, and

which, too fascinating to be relinquished,
she had carried off with her and still held
in her hand. " You are reading the 'Arabian
Nights.' What would you say to a
Good Genius who brought you the Lamp
of Aladdin, even though he should put on
the form of a gaunt old lawyer?"

Ah ! but there are no such Good
Geniuses now!" exclaimed Katy.

'^ Does she dare to tell me that? Ask
your grandmamma."

Mrs. Warner's smile a little puzzled
Katy.

'eat all events," rejoined she, "there
are no such lamps now-a-days as the Lamp
of Aladdin. No Wonderful Lamps that
can summon slaves and build palaces."

Do not make too sure of that either,"
returned her friend. " For my part, I have
always observed that money, provided there
be but enough of it, can command as
many slaves, and build as many palaces,
as any old lamp of them all."

And then yielding to the natural curiosity
of Katy, and the eager questioning of
her mother, Mr. Langhton, for the second
time, poured forth his marvellous tale.

Mrs. Bell, intent on hospitable cares, and
thoroughly persuaded that her guest had
had no dinner, had entered the room at the
very moment of this little dialogue, heading
a procession of serving-maidens bearing
every sort of refreshment, sweet and savoury,
that could be forced into the service
of the tea-table, and was just arranging
her stores of home-made dainties — hot-buttered
cake, ham, sausages, kidneys,
pork-pies, eggs, and honey-comb — when
Mr. Langhton's story assent," to useherown
expression, " all their wits a wool-gathering."
The result was a scene of disorder
rarely witnessed in that orderly house.

The tea-caddy fell fi'om its mistress's
grasp upon the floor; the tea-kettle, in
Eachel's trembling hands (for Eachel had

helped to spoil Katy from the time she was
a month old) first sopped the buttered
cake and then half-deluged the tea-tray;
"whilst the coffee-pot, wielded by the rosy-cheeked
Sally, had well-nigh spilt its boiling
contents on that pet of pets, the fat
spaniel, Flora, who, too lazy to get out of
the way, and accustomed to the observance
of all around her, looked up astonished at
the general confusion.

Mrs. Warner, however, by this time
recovered from her emotion, vindicated
Mr. Langhton's opinion of her calmness,
by assuming the direction of the tea-table.
Another hot cake made its appearance, and
the conversation resumed its desultory
course. A dozen such surprises would not
have silenced Mrs. Bell.

I am sure," said she, *That this great
fortune all comes from my having carried
Katy, when we were in London last year,
to see Mr. Strange at that place vrhich he

called an Inn, but wHch, so far as I could
make out, is not an Inn at all. That visit
was the cause of this good luck."

^^ The Will is dated twenty years ago,"
observed ]Mr. Langhton.

'never mind that, "persisted she; "what
does the date signify? I am quite sure
that our visit did it all. But at first, to be
sure, he seemed rather put out by being
called down to that little place of a Lodge ;
and seemed to doubt if we were really his
cousins from Atherton, till I showed him a
great basket with a Michaelmas goose and
a turkey and chine, and some lean meats."

"Ah!" quoth !Mr. Langhton, "so he
recognised them?"

Yes ; and desired that when we sent
up a hamper at Christmas, we should put
in some turnips and carrots to eat with the
chine, and plenty of sweet herbs to stuff
the turkey ; and, above all, he charged us
not to forget to pay the porterage as well
as the carriage.

^^ He was willing to remove any doubts
that you might entertain respecting his
identity. Did he say nothing to my little
queen here ?"

'^ He seemed mightily taken with her,"
replied the good mother; 'chucked her
under the chin, and desired her to give
him a kiss."

*' That was less peculiar," observed the
old lawyer. '' Many a man might have
made that request, and have invented the
relationship on purpose."

'' I did not kiss him, though," interrupted
Katy, raising her head from her
grandmother's lap, as she sate leaning
against her knee.

*'He was mightily taken with her,
nevertheless," resumed Mrs. Bell; 'rand
fumbled for a long time in those ragged
pockets of his to find a halfpenny to give
her. I have kept it myself'' continued
she, fumbling in her turn in a huge pocket

which sent forth a jingling <sound>sound</sound> of many
keys, mixed with thimbles, scissors, ,
knives, slate-pencils, a small
padlock, a string of buttons, and money of
all denominations. The treasure in question,
the miser's gift, was carefully hoarded
in an old-fashioned housewife. " I have
kept it," said she, '' partly as a curiosity,
partly for luck — you see there's a hole in
it. Katy's so careless, that I was afraid
to trust it with her, for fear of her losing
it, or giving it to the first beggar she met.
And you see how right I was, and what
luck it has brought her after all."

The poor old halfpenny ! " cried Katy,
again looking up. ^^ You will give it tome
now, dear mamma : will you not ? 'No
fear that I should lose it now ; I shall keep
it as long as I live in memory of one who
meant me so kindly. And yet it will be
very bad luck if this legacy takes me from
you, grand mamma, and from dear Atherton."


*' But the legacy will neither take you
from Atherton, or from grand mamma. I
am your guardian, and your dear grand-mamma
will be joined with me in the
trust ; and she and your good mother will
receive a large allowance for taking care
of you."

'^ Ah ! how good they have always
been ! what care they have taken of me
when I was nothing but a trouble to
them!" exclaimed the heiress.

'' And now I must be going. What
shall I send you from London? Think
what you want."

^^ Oh ! I have never wanted anything in
all my life."

"Then you have been happier than most
people," said the lawyer. " But think
again. If you want nothing for yourself,
do not you want something for others?
Your good mamma, does she want nothing?"
added he, in a low voice.

The colour rose in Katy's cheek.

^^ Let me whisper in your ear, Mr.
Langhton; it's a secret. Could you, do
you think, get in London foui' great,
strong, beautiful cart-horses — perfect
beauties''

'' Yes."

" Handsomer than Mr. Thoi-p's, the
miller ? Mamma has always had such a
hankering after a bell-team like Mr.
Thorp's. But I should like it to be finer
than his. So would she. She would like
that better than anything in the world, if
you could manage it."

" I think it may be contrived. We
shall see. Anything else?"

" And a new jacket and trowsers — a
whole suit — for little Jacob Stokes. He
takes care of my pony ; and helps in my
garden ; and, poor boy, he is as ragged asa
colt. And a new stuff-gown for poor
Dame Barnes ; and another — ''

^^ Stop my queen, stop. You shall have
money for jackets and gowns. But grand-mamma
— do you want nothing for the
dear grandmamma?"

Could you get a book called ^ Sir
Charles Grandison,' do you think? Grand-mamma
was saying the other day she
should like to read it over again. I wonder
if it's as charming as the arabian
Nights ! ' And money to give away in
cloaks and blankets. Let that be sent to
grand mamma. Ah ! I wish that all the
fortune had been left to her ! She would
have spent it so much better than I shall
ever do."

^^ You will spend it none the worse, my
dear, for mistrusting yourself. Bless God
that you have such an example and such
an adviser in all serious matters. And for
the things which young ladies are expected
to know in this wicked world, the common
ways of what is called society, we

must look about for a guide. Do you see
much, of the good folk at the Rectory,
Mrs. Warner ? Mrs. Glenham is an elegant
woman. I should think that her
daughters would be nice companions for
Katy?"

" The giiis are still very young," replied
Mrs. Warner : '^ children of ten and eleven.
And we see less of Mrs. Glenham than
formerly''

''^Mi's. Glenham calls Katy a romp,"
added ^Ii's. Bell, in an affronted tone.

" She has never forgotten an unlucky
nutting party in Atherton Wood, where
frocks were torn, and bonnets crushed, and
slippers lost," said the grandmother,
smiling.

'^ I am sui-e it was all the fault of her
own two sons," resumed Mrs. Bell.
'there is not so rude a boy as Charles
Glenham in all Atherton."

'harry is not rude," interposed Katy.
He's the kindest creature in the world."

It's more than cau be said of his
prim sisters, or his fine lady mother," rejoined
Mrs. Bell. *' She told me to my
face that my daughter set hers a bad example.
A bad example ! Let her look
at home. If Katy does get into a scrape
now and then, whose fault is it, I wonder ?
"When she happened to be riding Jacob
Stokes's donkey, and the animal put his
fore feet into a ditch, and sent her over
his head — was not it because Charles Glen-ham
started out of the opposite hedge,
blowing a cow-horn ?"

"But Ilany picked me up," quoth
Katy.

*^ And when Lord Delancy caught her
in our orchard, perched in the middle of a
cheiTy-tree — was not it because Master
Charley had carried off the ladder ?"

" Any helped me down, mamma. Remember
that."

" Well ! Of course a great lad just going

to College is not quite so bad as his
younger brother. But for my part, I'll
have nothing to say to the Gleams.
Mrs. Glenham to lecture me, and call
Katy incorrigible I"

'^ You are quite right, Mrs. Bell. We'll
have nothing to say to them. And now I
must be off to the Hall. Farewell, dear
lady. Good-bye, my queen."

VOL. I.

CHAPTEE IV.

THE LAWYER.

Stephen Langhton was, as the reader will
have gathered from the preceding pages,
a great London solicitor.

Forty years before he had left this very
village of Atherton, of which his father
was rector, to join his uncle, the head of
an eminent firm in Norfolk Street, Strand.
There, as clerk, as partner, and as successor,
he had remained ever since ; an old
bachelor like his predecessor, and like him
uniting considerable taste and talent to
unblemished integrity and much knowledge
of his profession. From him, too,
he inherited a trick of making friends of
his clients, and taking a fidgety interest in

their prosperity and well-being. A peculiarity
which contributed far more to the
comfort and advantage of his employers
than to his own ; since, although in his
own person free from all encumbrance (to
borrow a favourite advertising phrase), he
shared all the anxieties produced by un-thrift
heirs, unmanageable schoolboys,
marriageable daughters, and gullible
widows ; and was indeed the general
adviser, trustee, and executor of all his
clients, dead or living.

For those belonging to his native village,
he entertained particular affection;
especially for Lord Delancy, whose property
had been managed by the firm
which he represented for upwards of a
century ; and with whom, although ranking
amongst the haughtiest members of
the aristocracy, he had lived, from the
days when they were playfellows and
schoolmates to the present hour, on terms

E 2

of fraternal affection and familiarity. And
now this interest was deepened and saddened
by the storm of adversity, which,
after having been gathering for years
around his noble friend, seemed likely to
crush him to the very earth.

A long-pending suit respecting a disputed
will had just been given against him.
To feed this suit, mortgage upon mortgage
had been granted upon his paternal estates,
until those estates would hardly defray
the securities with their accumulated
interest.

In truth the property itself, extensive
and splendid as it appeared, had been involved
for many generations. The portions
of younger sons, the do^vries of
daughters, the jointures of widows had
prest upon it heavily; and, as so often
happens with large nominal estates, each
noble proprietor had lived up to his estimated
rather than his real income.

There had been no vice amongst them ;
no gambling by cards or dice, no racing,
no profligacy. Taste had been their worst
enemy. One ancestor had restored the
old baronial castle from which their title
was derived in a northern county ;
another had built the splendid mansion of
Atherton Hall. The late Lord Delancy
had worthily filled the noble picture-gallery
designed by his progenitor ; and
the present had furnished the library with
equal regard to everything except expense
: whilst all of them had practised
largely the unprofitable virtues of hospitality,
generosity, independence, and disinterestedness.
There were no place-holders
or place-hunters in their long
line.

Their very pride, and proud they were,
Alas based upon a scorn of meanness in
every form.

In the present head of that old house, a

peculiar sense of locality, a clinging to
early feelings would, Mr. Langhton knew,
add tenfold bitterness to the bitter draught
which he had to administer. At Atherton
he had been born. There he had wooed
and wedded the beautiful wife whose untimely
death had left him a bereaved and
solitary man. Four lovely children, of
whom the youngest only survived, had
been born there; and three had been
buried in the same church with their
mother — the same church where their
parents' marriage had been celebrated.
Every association of bliss and of sorrow,
the joy bells and the funeral knell boimd
him to Atherton.

Latterly, indeed, for very love of that
dear home, he had resided there less constantly.
He could not bear to look upon
the scenes he was so soon to lose. But
there he was expected this evening to
meet his only son, a distinguished young

officer, who, although long absent with his
regiment, in the Peninsula, at Waterloo,
in France, fully participated in this tenacious
fondness for the seat of his ancestors,
the home of his youth.

The thought of the unworthy possessor
who would step into their place was the
bitterest drop of all.

An orphan relation, the son of a cousin-german
of Lord Delancy's father, had
been educated, fitted out, and sent to
India by his generous kinsman. Those
were days in which men of good abilities,
of a determined spirit, and not too sturdy
a morality, still contrived to make fortunes
in our Eastern empire. Bold, ambitious,
subtle, and supple, Vivian Delancy was
the very man to succeed there. He
became governor of one of our richest
provinces, and wealth gathered round him,
no one knew how. Whilst still in the
vigour of life, he returned to England in

the full hope (for hitherto everything had
prospered with him) that the sickly lord
whom he had left and his puny boy would
both be dead before his arrival. Some
flattering correspondent, who had read
his heart too well, and wanted a favour,
had sent him word that they were actually
dying ; and believing what he wished,
he expected, on landing in England, to
find no obstacle between himself and the
ancestral title.

Half of his hope was fulfilled, fais
kind benefactor was dead ; but the young
heir had shot into a vigorous man, strong
and hardy as one of the oaks in his own
park, and was upon the point of manage
to the lovely but apportioned daughter of
a country gentleman.

The young lord invited his cousin to
Atherton ; and with characteristic treachery,
partly from love, partly from this old
and well-concealed hate (for there is no

greater quickened of a puny love than a
deep hatred) the Indian cousin entered
the lists as a suitor. The fair Helen,
unlike her namesake, proved constant to
the betrothed lover who had first won her
maiden heart. They were married, but
not until calumny upon calumny, insult
upon insult, had provoked a challenge,
the result of which left Vivian Delancy
with a bullet in his shoulder, and a vow of
vengeance in his heart.

From this hour the pertinacious and
unscrupulous man pursued the ruin of his
rival with a bitterness of determination, a
concentrated malice which became the
ruling passion of his strong nature. He
followed vengeance in England as in India
he had followed gold, the rather that a
remote but patient hope of attaining the
ultimate object of his ambition — the
family estates ; a hope that seemed to
grow by delay, mingled with the lust of

revenge, and seemed favoured by circumstances.


An old relation, to whom, had he died
intestate, Lord Delancy would have been
the legal heir, had long promised to bequeath
his great wealth to the head of
the house, not merely from affection towards
his kinsman, but for the purpose of
clearing the family property, and placing
the old name in the high position which it
had so long occupied in the country.
This promise, voluntarily made, increased
the carelessness as to pecuniary matters
which had been the solitary sin of the
race. The pledge had been renewed on
Lord Delancy's marriage to a portionless
beauty. Mr. Langhton had himself drawn
up the will.

Nearly twenty years after, the aged
cousin died, and a later will was produced,
bequeathing the entire property to Sir
Vivian, who had long since, to his infinite

disgust — he, who valued only an old peerage
— been included in a batch of baronets.
The whole household was in consternation.
No one had suspected the intention or the
act; and upon a closer investigation, a
paper, wanting certain formalities, was discovered,
re-bequeathing all to his beloved
kinsman and godson, Arthur, Lord Delancy.
Then, when this paper was rejected for
informality, a third document was discovered
— the copy of a letter addressed to
the solicitor who had drawn the second
will — directing its destruction.

Imagine the materials for litigation in
this complication of circumstances ! What
were the actual facts of the case, nobody
could venture to pronounce. No quarrel
had taken place between the testator and
his declared heii\ But they lived in distant
counties ; the omission of a visit, the
misconstruction of a letter, the mere caprice
of age, might have caused his

change of intention. On the other hand,
the known character of the claimant gave,
to all acquainted with him, ample reason
for a suspicion of foul play. Witness after
witness came forward to give testimony to
that effect ; and a missing valet was chased
over three parts of the globe, who could
prove, they said, the writing and the
delivery of the letter of which the copy
had been produced. The fate of this man
was never clearly ascertained ; but it was
at last supposed, and probably with truth,
that he was amongst the passengers who
perished in the wreck of a vessel bound to
Canada.

Years had passed away in this miserable
litigation; anxiety had succeeded to
anxiety; suspense to suspense; trial to trial;
and now, after enormous expenditure, the
final decision had been given against Lord
Delancy; and the last lingering hope had
died away for ever.

The termination of the great will cause
was of course known to all parties ; but a
far severer blow was yet to come. Suspicions
had been awakened that the money
so long, and with so fatal a facility, advanced
on mortgage, had been lent through
a third person. This suspicion was now
proved to be correct, and the real mortgagee
— he who, after some months and
some few formalities, could eject the present
occupier from all his ancestral estates;
from Delancy, the old northern hold, and
Atherton, the beloved home, with their
affectionate tenantry and matchless collections,
was no other than their adversary
in the lawsuit, the ungrateful and revengeful
kinsman.

To talk over this painful termination of
a cause, of which he had always dreaded
the result, was Vir. Langhton's business at
the Hall. His hard features twitched ashe
thought of the conversation he had to

go through. He had armed himseK with
a choice copy of Lord Beer's Translation
of Froissart, as a present to his brother
bibliomoniac — a tall copy, in all the
glory of its original binding, with silver
tips and silver clasps, picked up at a sale
fabulously cheap. But he knew that, talk
as they might of the chivalrous old chronicler,
who seemed born to immortalise high
deeds, and of the brave Englishman, who
seemed born for no purpose but to translate
him, the words might issue from their lips,
but their hearts would be far away.

The young heir, too, the gallant soldier,
Arthur Delancy, returning to the home of
his fathers, only to hear that that home
must be abandoned for ever! Arthur,
whom he had loved as a son from earliest
childhood ! ^^ That accursed lawsuit ! "
thought the good lawyer. And no stronger
proof can be given of the sincerity of his
interest in his clients than to say, that his

own predictions as to the result having
been so completely verified, never once
crossed his mind as a consolation.

Such were the dark thoughts which
caused Stephen Langhton's foot to rest fora
moment on the step of the post-chaise
which had waited to convey him to the
Hall. Ascertaining, even in the midst of
his troubles, the safety of the precious
Froissart, he sent in Mrs. Bell and Katy,
who had attended him to the door with
eager hospitality, and turned to take a
parting look at the fanny.

There it stood, with the bright fires
glowing through the windows in parlour
and hall, the glancing lights within the
house, and the ruddy glare of lanthorns
passing from stable to cow-stall, and from
cow-stall to calf-pen, with all its cheerful
sights and rural <sound>sounds</sound>, the very image
of rustic plenty. The view brought other
speculations to the mind of our good

lawyer. ^^ I found this place," thought ;
he, '^ the abode of peace and comfort,
when I came bearing the tidings of this ,
new wealth to disturb its tranquillity.
Can content and wealth keep house to j
gather ? Can a child, so rich, so pretty,
so innocent, and so confiding, be trusted |
with that simple mother, and that single j
minded grandmother ? The world is full j
of snares, even this little world of Others
ton. As yet, she had seen nobody more
dangerous than the lads of the Rectory,
to whom she is probably only a gayer and \
a Tv^lder sister, a playfellow or a play |
thing. But how long will this last ?
Money, and the want of money, form half ^
the trials of this life." Money, and the :
want of money ! the approximation seemed ;
to suggest yet another train of reflections
as the chaise threaded the winding village |
street, and passed through the richly-worked
iron gates, and between the
stately lodges of Atherton Park.

Even in a November night that fine
scenery retained its characteristic beauty.
The moon, almost at the full, shed a
silvery light upon the dewy lawns ; just
touching the brown tops of the huge oaks,
that stood out as headlands or promontories
from the deep woods, which stretched
up the hills on either side ; or flinging a
dark shadow from the clumps of holly,
hawthorn, birch, and beech, which, mingled
with single trees, dotted the foreground.
Just beneath the eye, a broad
stream was crossed by a low bridge of
several arches, and after many windings,
swelled out in the lower portion of the
park, into a picturesque lake.

Half-way up the ascent, the mansion, a
noble Palladian structure of white stone,
lay bathed in the moonshine. The long
colonnades which joined the centre to the
wings, and the deep-pillared portico, with
its rich Corinthian capitals, which swept

YOL. I, F

down by broad flights of steps to the terrace,
and its massive balustrade, gave
back the light J&amp;:om pediment to capital,
from capital to basement, almost as vividly
as at noon-day. A lime-tree avenue,
leading to other lodges, just showed
through a vista its high-arched branches
and chequered ground. The faint odours
of the decaying leaves marked the season,
and the peculiar scent of a group of towering
Lombardy poplars, which rose like
columns on a point of land near the
bridge, literally perfumed the air.

Perfect tranquillity was the characteristic
of the scene. Here and there a
majestic swan seemed sleeping on the
water, or a single deer, startled by the
<sound>sound</sound> of the <sound>rumbling</sound> vehicle, darted
from its bed of withered fern, under
some gnarled and twisted hawthorn,
to bound across the la^vn. All else
seemed at rest; and the house, when.

after half-an-hour's^ drive, the traveller
reached it, might have passed for uninhabited.
Such, however, was not the
case. The visitor was clearly expected.
At the first <sound>sound</sound> of the wheels, a light
appeared in the hall ; and before the postilion
had rung the bell, two servants
flung open the folding doors, and ushered
him into the half-lighted library, where
father and son advanced to meet him.

CHAPTEE Y.

FATHER AND SON.

Father and son, the two gentlemen to
whom Mr. Langhton was conducted, evidently
were. In point of figure, tall, erect,
and stately, — they might almost have
passed for brothers ; in face, too, the resemblance
was most striking. It was the
same head in youth and in age. The
general expression was alike in both —
grave, thoughtful, calm, and aristocratic.
But the guest soon perceived, a peculiar
look in the elder man — worn, anxious,
distressed, which seemed to have added

ten years to his age in as many weeks ;
deepening the lines about the month and
on the pale forehead; converting into a
permanent frown that which before denoted
only pensiveness ; sinking his eyes
deep under their brows, and robbing them
of gaiety and sweetness; thinning and
whitening the hair, which three months
before had been as brown and as glossy as
the crisp curls of his son.

As he grasped the hand of his old Mend
and schoolfellow. Lord Delancy exclaimed:

'^ You have no good news for me, Stephen,
or youwould have come here earlier.
You would have come before the time,"
continued he, as Mr. Langhton, transferring
the Froissart from one arm to the
other, began taking out his watch ; ^^ I
know it is the hour that I mentioned, but
with good news you would have flown."

^^!N;ay, my dear lord, I am here as soon
as I thought it likely that I should find you

and my young friend. And for my news,
that is no worse than it needs must be.
You yourself had little doubt but Sir
Vivian was the real holder of the mortgages?"


And now it is sure?"

A sad shake of the head — for a shake of
the head may be affirmative, and when sois
always sad — was the only answer.

^*A11 the mortgages?" interposed
Major Delancy.

'' All," was the' reply. '' He has contrived
to buy up every security, although
some dated as far back as your great-grandfather's
time."

'' Well, dear father, surely it is good to
know this ; good to have no more struggle ;
good to have done at once with a losing
fight ; good to relinquish for ever a false
position. Let the estates be given up. I
am ready to sign whatever papers may be
necessary. There may be such; for I

remember once, this man (and for that I
thank him) gave me credit for ratifying all
that you had promised, and advanced a
large sum, without waiting for my signature.
That at least proved him not quite
a stranger to the blood of the — "

Oh ! my son, my son ! to ruin such a
son ! "

"Nay, my dear father, hear me out.
Let all be done at once ; all given up, all
sold, all paid. Surely the proceeds — "

Will not be sufficient to pay Langton's
bill," exclaimed Lord Delancy.

Pshaw ! my bib ! Wait till I ask for
it," interjected the lawyer.

And of other debts than these mortgages,
you know," proceeded Arthur,
"that you have wisely kept clear. No
honest tradesmen will be ruined by our
ruin. The proceeds of such personal property
as has never been put in pledge,
will, I firmly believe, defray every just

claim, and leave enough for the purchase
of such an annuity as will maintain you in
comfort and in independence. Or if not,
let us dispose of my commission. The
world does not want ways by which a
young and healthy man may win an
honourable livelihood. Even in the midst
of this new peace, my own bad trade is
not without its prospects. Let me go as a
volunteer to India, to South America —
wherever warfare flourishes — and you will
see that I shall prosper as others have done
before me. Only let all be given up at
once, and trust me, we shall be happier
and richer than we have been during this
miserable struggle against an overwhelming
destiny. Only let all be given up."

To him ! " exclaimed Lord Delancy,
suddenly pausing in the rapid wall: up and
down the room, by which ho had been
striving to throw off some of the imitation
which shook the bodily frame even to

agony. '^ Yield to him the home of my
fathers ! disinherit for him a son of whom
the noblest of my ancestors might have
been proud ! Transfer to him my attached
tenants, my affectionate peasantry ! Make
him the master here, where, bred and fostered
like a child of the house, he raised
his hand against the son of his benefactor !
He left this place vowing eternal gratitude.
See," continued he, throwing a
tattered letter upon the table ; " I found
that scrawl the other day. The very ink
has faded, as refusing to perpetuate professions
so false ! the paper has crumbled
away like this promises. He left this
house poor and abject; he returned to it
rich and insolent."

'^ You disappointed him, my dear lord.
He left you a sickly child, never likely to
survive the trials of school, and the temptations
of college. He expected to find you
dead, and there you stood, tall and stout,

on the point of marriage to the prettiest
woman in the county."

^^ Poor Helen ! she feared him as an evil
spirit''

'^ She disappointed him too. He expected
her to throw over the man of her
heart, as fine a young fellow in those days
as Arthur is now, in favour of a rival as
dry and gnarled and yellow as a bamboo-cane."


^ ' Poor, poor Helen ! That rivalship washer
first grief, and his threats, vague and
worthless as they seemed then, not only
embittered but shortened her life."

'' Your good father," resumed Lorde
again pausing in his walk, '^ always
said that as a child, a mere child, I had
once offended this cousin, then a youth;
and that his hatred dated from that
hour."

'^ For my part," returned Stephen, " I
firmly believe that the hatred and the love

were both subservient to the ambition.
He courted Helen Aubrey, in the hope of
preventing your marriage, whilst he accomplished
his own, taking the chance of
your throwing yourself into dissipation, orin
any event not speedily settling, so that
he might still retain his place as heir-presumptive
to the title. The duel had
the same object in view ; whilst this affair
of the will and of the mortgages, is still a
step in the same direction. He can't get
the old barony ; so he'll be content with
the old estates."

'^ He has only to live long enough,"
observed Arthur, " and he may be the
possessor of both ; for I do not think my
dear father likely to marry, and I am perfectly
certain that I never shall."

Phew ! phew ! " whistled the old lawyer,
a most incredulous <sound>whistle</sound> it was.
"Live to my age before you make a vow
of celibacy, and don't be too sure of keeping
it then".

^^ Sir Vivian may soon resume his place
in the Peerage, as heir-presumptive,"
said Lord Delancy. " When the new
owner takes possession of the mansion,
the old master will find room in the family
vault."

^^ Dear father!"

"Lord Delancy!"

And the one speaker led him affectionately
to a seat : whilst the other instinctively
laid a strong grip on the travelling-pistols,
which, mixed with other loose
baggage, the servants had thrown on one
of the tables.

]N'ay, Stephen, you may spare that
precaution — I had no intention to alarm
you, my dear son. But more men die of
a broken heart than we read of in the bills
of mortality. And to think that my own
obstinacy and improvidence should have
aided this man's villainy, to disinherit
such a son as Arthur, might kill a stronger
man than I."

I will not listen to such words, dear
father ! ''

Nor I," quoth Stephen. " Besides, I
have a remedy in my head."

'' Do you remember, Arthur," said his
father, " the beautiful group of witch-elms
on the west lawn ? Artists used to travel
from London to sketch them. There was
a tradition that under them the family
plate had been buried in Cromwell's time,
when, what with sieges, fires, and sequestrations,
our declension began. "Well !
the tallest of these trees was stricken,
they tell me, by the great gale this equinox
— "

'^ And falling luckily," interrupted Stephen,
'' against the tree next in point of
size, and nearest in point of situation,
was propped by that friendly supporter;
so that it has been found possible to replace
the noble tree, (you know how
clever a fellow Lawson the woodman is !)

and there it stands, the goodly witch-elm,
as firmly rooted as ever. Omen for omen,
my good lord ! Mrs. Bell and Katy, to
the full as superstitious as yourself, went
to see it yesterday. They told me the
whole story but now."

Lord Delancy shook his head, as unwilling
to accept the augury. The son and
the friend gazed for a moment on that
other noble tree, which seemed quivering
to its fall. Their eyes met. But Stephen's
tone had lost nothing of its cheerfulness,
as he exclaimed suddenly :

Apropos to Mrs. Bell's tea-table, where
I heard this news, you seem to forget that
neither you nor Arthur have taken any
dinner, and that I myself, although fresh
from that region of hospitality, shall be
none the worse for a cutlet and a glass of wine.
I have a project for you, my good friends,
for both of you, and for that determined
bachelor, Master Arthur, in particular ; a

project to propose, and a story to tell. But
not a syllable shall you hear until you have
taken some refreshment. Besides which,
this affair of the mortgage is in no such
hurry. Some impertinent wit has said
that luckily law always takes time to do
justice.' Now I append to that, speaking
in honour of the mistress whom I serve,
that to commit injustice. Law also takes
her leisure. The notice of foreclosure is
not served yet. And after that, we have
six months good. Let us go to dinner ;
after which we can talk matters over
calmly. Some very strange events have
occurred within these few days, events
altering the prospects of some of these
good folks at Atherton not a little."

Good folks of Atherton !" cried
Arthur. " What can that mean ? Our
friends of the Eectory ?"

*^ Ha ! I am glad to see that you have
sense enough to be curious, Major. They

call curiosity a female passion, but I call
it a search after knowledge, and would not
give up my right to a fair share of so good
a quality to any woman in the world.
However, you must keep your spirit of
inquiry under subordination for the present,
for not a syllable shall youhear until
dinner be fairly past''

"Eelentings on the part of your
cousin !" quoth Mr. Langhton, some two
hours after the foregoing conversation,
when a few glasses of champagne had
brought a little blood into Lord Delancy's
cheeks, '^ sales to some other party !
Pshaw ! he has your title-deeds as closely
locked up as his own heart. No, my plan
has nothing to do with mortgages or
parchments. It bears a far more attractive
form. What do you think of matrimony,
Arthur ? A man is never so near
to becoming a bridegroom as when he has
just made a vow to die a bachelor. What

say those excellent reporters, the dramatists?
Look into all the eases from
Benedick downward. My proposal is
neither more nor less than a pretty young
wife."

The suddenness of this announcement
startled both his hearers, transferring
to Arthur's countenance the
paleness which had before overspread
his father's.

You have often said, my dear boy,
that you would do anything in the wide
world to avert this misery. And I fully
believe you, for all that lay in your power
in the way of self-sacrifice, you have done.
If you had not broken the entail to pursue
this long law chase, the estates here and
in the north, would have been preserved
to you. Of you, therefore, I feel certain.
What I have to ask on your part, my dear
lordy is the sacrifice of a little pride of birth
and alliance. Nothing else. For besides
VOL, I. a

that the money, far more than enough to
clear every debt, is absolutely in my own
hands, the little heiress through whom
it must be won, is as good, and as pretty,
and as certain to grace your old coronet,
as if she were a duke's daughter."

And then he told the story of Katy's
legacy, and how the thought of a marriage
between the two young people, each of
whom had undergone so strange a transition
of fortune, had darted into his thoughts.
His strong feeling for both parties lent
truth and earnestness to the manner in
which he set forth his project ; oversetting
with much dexterity. Lord Delancy's
objections, and opposing with characteristic
skill the portrait of Sir Vivian,
lord of Atherton, to that of dear, good
Mrs. Bell, <sound>loud</sound>, ruddy, vulgar, and fine,
as the mother of his daughter-in-law,
a picture from which the fastidious
gentleman shrank with instinctive repugnance.


"Never mind Mrs. Bell," quoth our
friend Stephen, " I'll answer for whenever
speaking three sentences in your lordship's
presence. Besides, I'll get Mary Osborne
to dress her. That little woman, my partner's
wife, is a jewel. She is to get a
governess for Katy. Never trouble yourself
about Mrs. BeU. Think of Mrs.
Warner. Sweet old Miss. Warner ! fair,
delicate, and simple as a female Friend ;
fit at this very moment to take her place
in your picture gallery. And Katy, think
of her; Reynolds might have painted
them both. Indeed, they are exactly
the pure English beauties that he did
paint."

Eemember though," added he, as
they rose to take coffee in the library,
that I cannot promise my gallant friend
here more than a chance of the young
heiress. But considering all things, the
hereditary respect for the family ; the

G 2

habit of thinking Atherton Hall a finer
place than Chatsworth, and Lord Delancy
a greater man than the Duke of Devonshire;
remembering also the advantages
of military distinction, and military bearing,
to say nothing of other good gifts ;
and, above all, considering the prodigious
power of opportunity, and of being the
first to pour sweet truths into the fair
lady's car; putting together, T say, all
these elements of success, I entertain very
little doubt of carrying off the prize."

^* A word with you," said Arthur,
stopping Mr. Langhton, as they followed
Lord Delancy through the hall, "one
word."

ingot if it be an objection," replied the
solicitor. " Are you too possessed of the
devil called Pride ?"

Pride, situated as we are ! " said
Arthur. " But this marriage, which after
all is mercenary ? this availing ourselves

of a position which is totally changed ? of
advantages which are vanished ? My
dear father, carried away by his notions of
family dignity, and by paternal partiality,
does not see this ; but you — '^

'' Be quite sure that every particular of
your situation shall be made known to
]airs. "Warner before tomorrow night.
And be sure, also, that with her feeling
towards you and my good lord, the prospect
that this wealth may prevent the
great wrong that would otherwise take
place, will be one of the consolations for
the dangerous change in her sweet child's
destiny. Both she and Mrs. Bell expressed
strong alarm at the chance of her
falling into the hands of some one who
would look down upon her, or teach her
to look down on them. They Avill seek
for nothing but high character in Katy's
husband. Neither shall I. And I never
gave so strong a proof of my respect and

esteem, as well as my affection, as when I
selected you as the happy man. Have
you any other objection to offer ?"

'^ Only my utter averseness to the marriage
state."

Averseness ! Does that mean a fancy
for another woman? Are you in love?
Are you engaged ?"

'No, upon my honour ; I am as free as
yourself."

So much the better. If you had been
engaged — "

*' I tell you, No. But to marry this
young gii'l merely for her money — "

Pshaw ! pshaw 1 a romantic scruple
like that is an anachronism in these days.
Leave me to take care of my ward. Look
at your father. Four hours ago, I would
not have insured his life for a month;
and now the very chance of escaping from
the venom of that cold-blooded Indian
snake, has acted upon him like the fabled

elixir. You, too, are fitted for another
age, with your hatreds and your delicacies.
But just think of him, and of all
the sacrifices you have made, and do not
render them vain by starting off at last.
Sacrifice ! '' exclaimed he with enthusiasm,
" I ought to be hanged for using the word
in connection with the brightest and
sweetest little rosebud that ever blossomed
in a country garden. And you ought to
be hanged if you are not over head and
ears in love with her before three months
are past. Take the word of an old man
who has seen a good deal of this best of all
possible worlds, and has had occasion to
observe pretty often that in fulfilling our
duties at the expense of our fancies, weare
generally sure to be rewarded even in
this life. Would not any one think I was
urging you to marry the TJrganda of a
fairytale?"

^^ I don't care for beauty," interrupted
Arthur."

^^I do' said his companion, "in common
with most men. And you will be a
person of a singular taste if you do not
think her beauty of a very attractive sort.
Now let us go to your father. I have a
present for him in his way and mine ; a
choice old book, picked up for a song. I
did not dare produce it before ; but by
this time, thanks to our project, he'll be
able to look at and enjoy it. Is not this
worth something, Master Mercenary ?"

CHAPTEE VI.

HE IR-HXJN TING.

On his return to town, one of Mr.
Langhton's first visits was to the abode of
his partner, Mr. Osborne, a clever man of
five-and-thirty, who, originally an articled
clerk in the house, had been taken into
the firm without money, on the strength
of his abilities and his character — points
in which the senior partner was seldom
mistaken. A year or two before he had
taken to himself the questionable luxury
of a wife ; and our old bachelor, fond,
after his fashion, of James Osborne, and

accustomed to command his society at
breakfast and dinner, grumbled over a
measure which threatened to deprive him
of his company during many a <sound>quiet</sound>
evening in Norfolk Street. "Forethought
he, with the <sound>grunt</sound> of a deeply-injured
man, ^^ he'll be going home."

Matters were not greatly mended when
he found that Mr. Osborne made of his
young wife a universal authority and
referee in all matters extra-legal, even
when they seemed most unfit for a wearer
of petticoats. If Mr. Langhton happened
to inquire :

^^What did that De Bry fetch at
Evans's ? " the answer was :

rU ask Mary."

If, " What can I have done with the
Dundalk?"

^^Mary can tell."

Mary could get an authentic copy
of the Ban of the Empire. Mary

knew where to send for the score of the
*^ Requiem."

The clouds began to disperse when Stephen
discovered that Mrs. Osborne really
knew those things of which her husband
boasted, and she did not; and the sky-grew
quite clear when he heard from his
housekeeper that his Kendal pudding was
made from her recipe, and that his warm
winter hose were knitted in the charity
school of her father's parish ; in short, that
she was not that odious thing, a female
Encyclopaedia, but an observing and intelligent
woman, who knew where to
find knowledge, and considered no trouble
too great, no object too small, so that it
enabled her to gratify her husband's
friend.

'^ She's a clever little body," thought
our friend ; and wil have performed my
commission, if anybody can, and found
me a governess who will teach dear Katy

to conceal the adorable ignorance which
would affront this accomplished age ; and
fill at the same time, the part of adviser-general
at the farm. To think that it
should fall to my lot to conduct a whole
feminine household ; I, who have always
eschewed the company of women ! and to
have the disposal of a great heiress — I, an
old bachelor of fifty-seven ! Poor, pretty
Katy ! I wish Arthur Delancy liked her
better. But he's a noble fellow, and the
love will come in time. She cannot choose
but like him ; she who has seen nothing
better than the Glenham boys, and the
clodhoppers of the village."

This meditation brought him to the tasteful
cottage at Chelsea, where his partner
had fixed his abode. He found Mrs.
Osborne, and lost no time in inquiring if
her search had been successful.

Yes, I know such a person," replied
his hostess, with rather more hesitation

than was usual with her; '' exactly such
a person as you desire."

sewell?"

And she has requested me to look out
for a family in want of a governess."

Well, then, send for her directly."

There is not far to send. Sir ; she is in
this very house. But she is my old schoolfellow
and very dear friend ; and I cannot
bear to think of her filling a dependent
situation. She is the orphan daughter of
an officer. Her father and her only brother
died shortly after each other ; her mother
she had lost before; and an aunt with
whom she went to reside, turning out that
terrible thing, a match-maker." (Here
Mr. Langhton winced a little, and uttered
an <sound>audible</sound> <sound>grunt</sound>, so that the fair speaker
interrupted her narration.) '' Surely, dear
Sir, you have no love of husband-hunting
chaperons, who hawk about poor girls for
the highest bidder''

"None whatever. But as to matchmaking,
that is a different matter. There
are matchmakers and matchmakers, as
Moliere Sganarelle says of faggots. Goon
with your story."

Well, finding herself put up to sale,
and her aunt indignant at her refusal of a
man utterly unworthy of her, poor Honor
wrote to me, requesting me to inquire fora
situation as governess — any situation,
the more retired the better, where she
might earn an honest living. And here
she has been for the last three weeks,
during which time, Sii', we have seen too
little of you, or I am sure you would like
her."

You mean Miss Clive, my dear ? I
do Hke her, and I like her spirit. She
will be much happier with good Mrs. Warner,
than with all the husband-hunting
aunts in the world. She'll be the very
person to form Katy. Those soft, gentle

manners are just what we want at the
Great Farm."

And she is so good, Sir," said Mrs.
Osborne, much gratified by this approbation.
" Mind, manners, and temper are
equally excellent. As for her accomplishments
— "

'^ Spare me the remuneration: good sense,
good principles, and good temper, are what
we want. The fewer accomplishments the
better for my little rustic. The new fortune
will be disadvantage enough. Do not
let us add new knowledge. Nothing is so
bad as an attempt at acquiring that which
there is no time to learn. It is combining
pretence and pretension. Engage Miss
Olive, of course, not as a governess, but asa
friend. I give you carte blanche as to
salary."

But, dear sir, I know her well, and
am confident that she will not accept more
than is right and usual. You will find

her an untractable person on certain
points."

" I shall like her all the better. How
could this aunt of hers venture to propose
an unworthy marriage to such a woman !
I leave you, my dear, to arrange matters
for me. Contrive, if you can, that Miss
Clive should be ready to accompany me to
Atherton as soon as may be after my return
from Buckinghamshire,"

The good lawyer's expedition to Buckinghamshire
was another branch of the
duties thrown upon him by this executorship.


During his absence, an artificer, cunning
in the miser's paraphernalia of false
bottoms and secret drawers ; springs that
no eye could detect, and locks that no
hand could open, disclosed in the deepest
profundity of an iron chest, a cavity filled
with bank-notes and bills, at once more
portable and more negotiable than the

bulkier bonds, mortgages, and title-deeds
which crammed almost to bursting the
upper part of the coffer. Strange is the
contrast of these yellow parchments and
discoloured papers, ghastly representatives
of wealth, to the hoards on which our ancestors
delighted to luxuriate: the kingly
coin, stately with its crowned impress ; the
heavy ingots of bettering silver or virgin
gold; the ropes of pearl; the dazzling
heaps of precious stones, ruby, topaz, amethyst,
emerald, sapphire, diamond ; such
were the rich sights on which the misers
of Massinger and Ben Jonson gloated.
Those great old poets would have scorned
this unimaginative age, where Mammon,
stripped of all his gorgeous accessories,
shows himself in all his naked deformity,
barely covered by a sordid panoply of rags.
In that innermost receptacle of the
money-chest, so cunningly hidden, were
two or three papers, which seemed at first

VOL. I. H

to have small reference to the cheques and
bank-bills by which they were surrounded.
Their pecuniary value was indeed very
trifling. The first document was an old
almanac of the year 177 — . The others
consisted of two or three notes, of which
the writer was evidently a woman, addressed
to Mr. Eichard Strange, and signed
E. Brown; a note of hand for twenty
pounds, bearing the signature of John
Brown ; and the rough copy of a letter, at
once a declaration of love and a proposal
of marriage, to which, on perusal of one of
the notes, was a gentle refusal.

Here was a curious episode in a miser's
life. The rough draft of the love-letter
was brief and characteristic, but not eloquent.
True feeling always finds true
words. Very real must that passion have
been which induced Eichard Strange to
offer his hand to a girl evidently without
fortune, and induced him to name her descendants

the heirs of so large a portion of
his riches, after an interval of nearly fifty
years. The notes signed "E. Brown"
were dated Weston; but that address,
which indeed they already possessed, was
the only indication to be gained from this
love hoard. The almanac at first appeared
to bear no relation to the event. But in
the months of July and August were found
small marginal notes, such as "Walked in
the woods with Betsy." " Bought a keepsake
for Betsy." '^ Wrote to Betsy." And
on the succeeding day was a final note,
summed up in two brief words : — ^* Went
away."

Our old bachelor <sound>sighed</sound> over those brief
words, sympathizing the rather with the
suffering, that the sufferer had abstained
from all complaint, even to that mute confidant,
the almanac. How different might
his life have been had that offer been accepted.


H 2

Turning to his ovm. business Mr.
Langhton felt that no fiu-ther revelation
was to be expected from the testator's
papers. Advertising was his only hope.
Indeed, the moment the cavity was discovered,
Mr. Osborne had multiplied advertisements,
thicker and wider, in almost
every newspaper in town and country.
These advertisements were, as usual, fruitful
in answers. The !Norfolk Street postman
bent under their weight, and doubted
whether Valentine's Day had not come
before its time.

Every "Weston in England had produced
its record of John or Elizabeth Brown.
Some a John ; some an Elizabeth ; some
both. Here they were christened ; here
married ; here buried. The good lawyer
groaned in spirit; the rather that the
indications were so slight that it would be
almost impossible for the most practised
and subtle tracer of genealogies to follow

such a trail. However, as the Buckinghamshire
Weston (Cowper s Weston) offered
the nearest approach to the family
group which he dimly guessed at, a John
Brown ha^dng been married, and an Elizabeth
Brown christened there about twenty
years before the date of the almanac, ho
resolved to undertake the journey; unconsciously,
perhaps, influenced by a desire to
examine the scenery of the ^^Task," a
poem which, in its purely English feelings,
its homeliness, and its teachings, appealed
strongly to his sympathies and his prejudices.


Upon this arrival at the little inn he
found that it was already the object of no
unfrequent pilgrimage.

Old inhabitant, Sii' ?" quoth a voluble
waiter. ^^ Mr. Cowper of course. Plenty
of people who remember him hereabouts.
Very shy, Sir ! But very kind-hearted."

Here Stephen attempted to interpose a
word.

"Parish Clerk, Sir! No use, Sir!
Won't find Mr. Cowper in the Register.
Gentleman came last summer, and hunted
it all through. Was not born here. Sir !
Was never married ! and <sound>died</sound> many a
good mile away, poor gentleman. Not in
the Register I assure you."

Again Mr. Langhton tried to explain
his wants.

Not Mr. Cowper, Sir ! Not the great
poet ! Less me, Sir ! People of the
name of Brown? Yes, Sir. I'll ask
directly. Would you not like to look at
Mr. Cowper's house, meanwhile. Sir?
Get you a boy in a minute. All the boys
know the way. Want to know about the
Browns, and to see the old people ? Yes,
Sir. Directly, Sir. Plenty of old women,
Sir ; know two close by. Sir, who have
lived here all their lives. Mr. Cowper,
poor gentleman, was very good to one of
them, and so were Mr. Harley, and Mr.

Johnson. Fetch them, Su'? Yes, Sir.
They shall be here as soon as you have
eaten your dinner, Sir. Broiled fowl
and mushrooms. Sir? Yes, Sii'. In a
jifly, Sir."

Meanwhile, Mr. Langhton having ascertained
that the clerk could only tell him
what the Register told ; and that the
cramped, uneven signature of the bridegroom
therein, bore no sort of resemblance
to the bold characters of the John
Brown in the note of hand, did actually,
in spite of his disclaimer to the waiter,
solace himself by a visit to the house
which the poet loved so well, and which
drew from him perhaps the most pathetic
letter on record — that in which he recognizes
his own malady by the touching
words, " I will forget that a letter from
me can only be regarded as a curiosity."

Musing over the sad mystery of that
strange affliction ; the alternations of

darkness and light, the enchanting playfulness
of the letters, and Hay ley's affecting
narrative of the long, miserable years
that preceded his death, a story full of
wilder contrasts and deeper poetry than
any which the poor poet ever wrote, our
friend forgot how time went, and found
the little waiter much propitiated by the
length of his absence, and a glimpse of
the volume which he carried in his hand.

'dinner ready? Yes, Sir. Got quite
cold. Warm it in a trice, Sii', Thought
you'd never come here without visiting
the Poet's house, Sii'. A good deal
changed, but something left still, Sir.
Thought you'd visit the old walks, and
the Hall, Sir. Talk of taking it down,
Sii*. Glad you came first. Got the old
women ? Yes, Sir. See them nov,-. Sir ?
Before dinner? Yes, Sir."

And he produced two crones, who in
point of age might have officiated as witnesses,

or if needful, as bridesmaids at
John Brown's wedding seventy years
before. Their examination nearly drove
our friend Stephen crazy. One was paralytic,
the other deaf.

The palsied hag was possessed with one
single idea (her Brunonian theory) of a
Jesse Brown, whom she had known in
her youth, and who lay buried in the
churchyard, having died when a promising
youth, '^ fourteen year old and a bittock."
Apparently he was alone in his generation
; for to every question respecting his
probable kith and kin, father, mother,
brother, sisters, uncle, aunt or cousin,
every possible owner of the desired christian
names, she returned no better answer
than a stolid "No." Whilst her brisker
partner was so deaf that she would hardly
have heard a pistol fired at her ear, could
not read, and all the <sound>shouting</sound> of the enraged
lawyer and his ally the waiter, who

brought all his powers of speech to bear
on the object, failed to drive into her head
the <sound>sound</sound> of Brown, or of any other monosyllable,
proximate or remote. The old
woman looked, and was thoroughly mystified.
At last a bright illumination flashed
upon her. The one name of the place
sprang from her lips :

"Ay, Sir, of course. Mister Cowper !
Nobody can tell you more of him,
poor gentleman. I charged for Madame
Unwind — "

What might be the exclamation that
escaped from her hearer she heard not,
nor need we inquire. Never was Stephen
Langhton known to swear before or since.
And if in that moment the words were
naughty, the provocation was great.
One thing is certain: that flinging his
tormentors half-a-crown apiece, he drove
back to London, determined, for the health
of his soul and body, to eschew personal

encounters with chattering waiters and
stupid old women; and to refer the inquiry
to the geniuses of the Chancery
Court or the Herald's Office, who can
track a genealogy for half a century,
through no clearer indications than a torn
letter or a defaced tombstone. The race
of Detectives had not yet found a name,
but the speciality has never been wanting.
And our friend, both as a man of the
world, and a great London lawyer, had a
faith that nothing could remain secret in
the face of a large reward. "This is a
question of supply and demand," thought
he, " money wants Betsy Brown, and
money must find her."

CHAPTER VII.

LCT. THE News OF ATHERTON.

Our story returns to the Great Farm at
the moment of the discovery.

The news of Katy's legacy spread like
wildfire through the village of Atherton.
In spite of her mother's quarrel TNdth Mrs.
Glenham, the good grandmother had a
deep respect for her pastor, as well for his
character as his office; as, indeed, no
sounder scholar or better man ever edited
a play of Euripides. She fully intended
to call upon him the next morning and
carry herself the grand intelligence ; but
long before Mi*. Langhton had left her lit •

tie parlour, the story was patent in every
comer of the place, the Eectory included.

Indeed, when we remember that Rachel
and her undermines, the rosy-cheeked
Sally, and Dinah the plump dairy-girl,
were present at its announcement, the
wonder would have been if it had remained
a secret.

Eachel, half beside herself with delight,
could not help giving vent to her ecstasy'
to her old fellow servant, Joseph Stokes,
as he sate gravely discussing his bargain
with the dealer; and thereupon, between
joy and gin-toddy, Joseph was beguiled
into the very worst exchange of sheep for
home cattle that he ever made in his
life.

Sally, the belle of the village, communicated
the intelligence to two village beaux
who paid homage to her rosy cheeks ; a
young carpenter and a younger blacksmith,
jointly engaged in repairing a
plough.

Dinah naturally told her tidings to the
herdsman who drove the cows to the milking
and the lad who helped her to milk.

Joseph told bargemen, ploughmen, shepherds,
and boys ; and his little grandson,
Jacob, who had picked up the news from
the very first without any telling at all —
to use his own phrase, " promiscuous like,"
little Jacob told everybody.

If verification were needed, it was supplied
by Mrs. Bell herself, who sallied forth
from the parlour, bearing a bottle in either
hand, followed by her daughter with sugars
lemons, bent on compounding a noble
bowl of punch, such a bowl as had not
been seen at the Great Farm since Katy's
christening.

At the "Eight Bells," at the "De-fancy
Ai-ms," at the shop, at the forge,
nothing was talked of that night but Katy's
legacy. And considering the general aversion
which is said to prevail in our poor

human nature, towards the good fortune
that alights on other people's heads, and
misses our own, it is creditable to our villagers
to be able to record that they bore
the glad tidings with fortitude and resignation.


]Mrs. Warner's constant charity — charity
of thought and speech, as well as of action
contributed doubtless to this result. It
is difficult to speak evil of one who never
says an unkind word of others. But that
which most conciliated goodwill, was the
universal impression of the young heiress's
open hand.

Well, little Miss is not so bad''

I know no harm of she

I don't think she takes after her
mother''

(Dear IVIrs.Bell played in this interlude
the part of Alcibiades' dog's tail.)

She'll not steal the bread from a poor
creature's mouth."

She's good to body and beast."
Such were the general <sound>exclamations</sound>.
And Katy vindicated the justice of public
opinion in Atherton that very night ; for
after stuffing Flora with as much cream
and buttered toast as that overfed
favourite, who had never in her life
known the pleasant sensation of a little
gentle hunger, could be prevailed upon to
swallow; she rescued her own particular
attendant, Jacob Stokes, from the dangers
of the punch-bowl, and seduced him into
the stable, where they jointly committed
petty larceny by opening certain bins of
oats and beans well known to both, and
bestowing a large benevolence of these
luxuries, first on her own pony, next on
Jacob's donkey, (formerly Katy's, but
presented to Jacob when she and her sidesaddle
were promoted to her present
steed) ; then indiscriminately to all the
horses within reach of the accomplices.

After which they finished their evening's
expedition by running down the lane to
Dame Barnes's cottage, with such a basket
of provisions, that the good woman declared
that she and her three little grandchildren
should not get through it in a
week.

"To think," added she, "that Miss
should laye promised me a new gown !
that in the midst of all this grandeur she
should recollect a poor old creature that
can only pray God to bless her !"

Perhaps Katy's happiest moment in
that first night of almost boundless affluence,
was this brief visit to Dame
Barnes's hut.

The news reached the Eectory after the
zig-zag fashion peculiar to country places,
and with the exaggerations and variations
common to all places, whether city or village.


The gardener, to adopt his own version

VOL. I. I

happened to cal at the ' Eight Bells,' ''
(he happened to call at one alehouse or
another on most evenings), " and there
he heard it was quite true, however
strange it sounded, that Miss Katy had
become a queen. He did not know of
what foreign parts, but a queen she was,
and with more money than the Queen of
Sheba."

Neb. It is just possible that the pet
name bestowed upon her long ago by Mr.
Langhton had something to say to that
accession of dignity.

Mrs. Glenham <sound>laughed</sound> in scorn.

Then the housemaid went for a ball of
cotton to the shop, and brought word back
that, Lord Delancy's titles and estates had
fallen to Mrs. Warner. — Strange it is to
trace those rumours that float in the air
like thistle-down ; pregnant warnings of
the calamities of great houses !

Mrs. Glenham remained incredulous.

Next the carpenter brought at once a
new bootjack and the real story, as he
had received it from Sally, an earwitness.


The Eector's lady, faithful to her
doubts, began yet to suspect that some
grains of truth might be mixed up with a
mass of falsehood.

At last, the Eector's churchwarden, an
intelligent man, and a native of Atherton,
coming in to leave some papers, confirmed
and explained the intelligence. He himself
knew Mr. Strange, and was aware of
the relationship; he had even heard,
moreover, of his wealth. Besides, the
quarter from whence the intelligence
came, removed all possibility of error.
Mr. Langhton was the most accui-ate of
men ; one who had never uttered an untruth
or made a mistake in his whole
existence.

Mrs. Glenham was astounded. This

i2

was the little girl whose influence over her
eldest son, the pride of her heart, she had
so much dreaded. Ever since she had discovered
certain stanzas to Louisa, enclosed
to her address, and had observed that his
walks and rides, whichever way they
seemed to tend on leaving home, invariably
ended at the Great Farm, she had
exerted all her address to keep the young
people asunder. Her only comfort had
been that the Laura of his rhymes seemed
quite unconscious of the ardent poet's
devotion, and in all their' walks and
parties, preferred the wild gaiety of
Charles. She had expended all her skill
and contrivance in parting those whom she
would now give ten years of her life to
bring together. It was just one of the
reproofs so often administered by events
to om wisest plans ; and Mrs. Glenham, a
clever woman, somewhat tinged by worldliness,
but by no means the worthless fine

lady that Mrs. Bell thought her, felt its
full force. In this mood she repaired to
her husband's study.

• There sat he, kindest and simplest of
men, surrounded by his books, in the midst
of various editions and German commentators,
intent upon a much-disputed passage
in a chorus of the Trades, and very
unwilling to be disturbed, even if the
house were on fire.

-Upon my word. Dr. Glenhara,'' said his
provoked lady, when she had twice poured
her tale into listening ears; ^4t is a
great pity that you ever left Cambridge.
You are fit for nothing but to be a Fellow
of a College and a Greek Professor."

It is a pity'' was the reply, delivered
with provoking simplicity. '* A College
Fellowship is free from disturbance and
care ; and to have succeeded Person would
have been a noble destiny — I beg your
pardon, my dear ; I believe you have been

talking to me' continued he, with retaining
recollection ; and when he at last
caught the sense of her narrative, she had
no cause to complain of any want Of
interest in the subject.

They talked it over in all its bearings,
and the affectionate manner in which the
good Eector spoke of the parishioners
upon whom so trying a change of fortune
had fallen so suddenly, emboldened JVIrs.
Glenham to say:

^^ Ay, now it would have been better for
all parties, if we had encouraged Harry's
admiration for our young friend. Her
fortune — ''

" Harry is to be a Fellow of a College,
Mrs. Glenham," interrupted the Doctor,
now thoroughly awakened to the realities
of life, and asserting, with a manliness
which became him well, the resolve of a
most upright and honour-able nature.
He has got King's, and must follow his

career at Cambridge, a career for which he
is well fitted. In due time he may, if he
see fit, take a living and settle. But as to
the nonsense of which you speak, the love
and the love-songs, why they have no
more vitality than the sickly autumn rose
which you are twirling in your hand, or
the dead leaves which are falling from the
great oak upon the window sill. If I were
not sure of this, I would give instant
notice to Mrs. Warner ; as it is, I shall
speak to Harry. I would rather see him
the husband of the poorest girl in the
village than that he should take advantage
of my position as clergyman of the parish,
and an old family friend, to pay his court
to the rich heiress. It is our place to protect
this young girl in a situation of
temptation and danger, not to betray her
into an unsuitable attachment. And now,
my dear, go to your daughters, and leave
me to the tragedy which earned for Euripides

the title of the most pathetic of
poets'

In all her life Mrs. Glenham had never
seen her husband so determined. The
only comfort was, that being a woman who
had walked through the world with her
eyes open, she had observed that in these
cases a little opposition is no bad fosterer
of love, and trusted that her son Harry
might prove no exception to the perversity
of his kind.

Meanwhile the year rolled on towards
its conclusion. Lord Delancy and his son
spent a fortnight at the Hall before separating,
the one for his regiment, the other
for London. The father's heart was
lightened, and the daily improvement in
his health and spirits cheered and comforted
the young soldier.

Before three days had passed, her noble
landlord had not failed to visit Mrs.
Waiter, and to become, as far as her shyness

and the recollection of the cherry-tree
would permit, familiar with the
young heiress. His air and figure and
stately bearing made a good deal against
the intimacy which he wished to establish,
especially whilst they remained in the
little parlour', where both he and the
Major looked, as Katy afterwards observed,
too tall for the room. His lordship
returned the compliment, by declaring
that poof ]airs. Bell was too broad for that
small apartment, and looked in her new
mourning not unlike a blackbird in a goldfinch's
cage.

Out of doors matters mended ; and in
spite of the season. Lord Delancy took
care to lui'e Katy out of doors, to visit her
bantams, to look at her pony, and to show
her a young greyhound which he had
brought fi'om the Hall, a beautiful creature
of that peculiar hue, which coursers, as he
remarked, are sure to miscall, sometimes
yellow, sometimes red.

'' She has no name yet. What shall she
be called, Miss Warner?"

Katy did not speak ; indeed, she had
hardly ventured to say more than yes or
no. But she gathered a flower from a
lingering plant of African Marigold,
which yet retained its richly-tinctured
blossoms in a southern nook, and laid the
clustering petals on the glossy head, which,
with unfailing instinct, had already sought
her caressing hand. Keeper were colours
more perfectly matched.

The father was enchanted, and even
Arthur smiled at the unspoken reply.

marigold by all means. A capital
name. And see, j\Iiss Warner, you have
chosen her name, and she has chosen her
mistress. You must not reject her. The
moment I can get away fi'om London we
will have a day's coursing in the Park.
See, Mrs. Bell, how she lies down at her
fair mistress's feet, as if to take possession."


'^ My father does not mean Marigold to
supplant my friend Flora' added Arthur,
for Flora, with similar instinct, had made
her court to him ; "that in my mind would
be a sin. The old favourite is sacred as
the old friend. But where the heart is
large, as I am sure yours is, we can find
room for new friends and new favourites.
Mrs. Warner says that Flora is too fat to
keep pace with your walks and rides ; so
Marigold must be the out-door pet, whilst
Flora retains her place on the hearth''

And !Mrs. Bell with many words, and
Katy with smiles and blushes, accepted the
gift.

An excellent excuse was this playful and
graceful creature for frequent visits from
the Hall. During which familiar intercourse
Lord Delancy grew as fond of Katy
as if she had been already his daughter,
whilst an unexpected intimacy sprang up
between Arthur, by no means so formidable

a personage as he looked, and Mrs.
Bell. He could hardly prefer her society
to her daughter's, except, indeed, as a
person whom he could by no chance be
called upon to marry; but so it was, that
while his father courted Katy for him, he
paid suit and service to the comely ^\ddow,
with whom he <sound>laughed</sound> and chatted for
hour's together. She repaid this devotion
with interest.

'^ There is nobody like the Major,"
quoth she, " nobody in all the world. To
think of my having been such a fool as to
be afraid of him. He has just sent this
beautiful collar for Marigold ; only look !
it's exactly like a silver bit. And hearken
to the little bells ; she won't know where
the <sound>sound</sound> comes from. And her name and
Katy's on the padlock; a real dog's necklace.
Katy, you don't look half grateful
enough ; not near so grateful as I was to
you for that noble team of horses and their

bells. And I know what the Major is
going to do besides."

swell," said Katy, more cushions than
she chose to appear, " what ?''

'^ Only if I tell you, you will say that I
cannot keep a secret."

^^ Dear mamma, if it be really a secret,
don't tell."

'' Nobody told me. Suppose — "

'' Wel, but if it be a secret—"

I found it out, I tell you. Suppose he
has got a new horse for you, and is going
to train it himself. What do you say to
that ?'

Katy listened and blushed, like a woman.
Then, like a child as she was, <sound>burst</sound> into
sudden <sound>laughter</sound>, <sound>clapped</sound> her hands, and
danced about the room, whilst her mother
nodded in triumph, and Mrs. Warner,
evidently Mr. Langhton's accomplice,
looked on 'with pleased approbation.

So matters stood at Atherton, when its
noble master left the Hall.

CHAPTEE VIII.

THE GOVERNESS.

Another fortnight brought a more permanent
visitor to the Farm. At the close
of a short December day, Miss Clive
arrived with Mr. Langhton.

All girls receive with some trepidation
that alarming functionary, a governess ;
and it is probable that she who causes the
fear, often feels herself a deeper emotion
than she inspires.

Under the peculiar circumstances, all
the ladies of the Farm were a little anxious,
or, to use Mrs. Bell's phrase, more graphic
than elegant, "in a flurry."

Mrs. Warner's head shook more than
usual as she received the stranger ; Mrs.
Bell poured forth questions and hospitalities
without stint or measure ; and Katy's
cheeks, always bright, glowed like damask
roses. Except a little paleness, the governess
gave no outward sign of disturbance.
She had suffered too much not to be perfect
in the great lesson of self-command.

"How do you like her?" asked Mr.
Langhton of Mrs. Warner, when the
younger ladies had taken her to show her
her own apartment, and to adjust her dress.
What do you think of her ? "

'' I think she looks good."

^^ And pretty?"

The old lady hesitated.

Ah ! I see that you do not. Neither
did I at first, delicate, and graceful, and
elegant as she is. To be sure, by the
side of that bright little queen of ours,
everything is dim. But you will think
her pretty by-and-bye."

She must be much better than pretty
to have won your heart so entirely," said
Mrs. Warner.

"She will soon win yours; of that I am
certain. By the way, when she came in,
she was a little shaken. She did not
know, till I showed her the Hall, that
Lord Delancy had a place here ; and it
seems that she knew him, or some of his
family — I think his sister-in-law. Lady
Cardonnel — in happier days. She was
half-inclined to go back again. The only
weakness that I have detected in her, is a
shrinking from the recognition of old
acquaintances. You know she was an
officer's daughter, and lost her father and
her only brother within six months of
each other. I told her the family was
absent, and you must contrive before their
return to make her feel that she belongs
to you."

"We shall try," said Mrs. Warner.

And she must take us, young and old,
under her wing ; for I suspect that the
mamma and grand mamma are more taken
aback by this great change than the
heiress herself£ But this young lady, who
seems so simple and gentle, with all her
elegance, will put us in the way."

Before the end of the evening, Mr.
Langhton had the satisfaction to find
Katy's shyness disappear, and to see her
seated on her old footstool, at the feet of
her new friend.

"Do not call me Miss Warner, pray,"
said she ; '^ I do not know myself by that
name. Cal me Katy."

'' Must I call you Katy ?" was the reply.
And suppose I were to make a condition,
and ask you to call me Honor?"

Honor ! " exclaimed Mrs. Bell.

'^ Honora is the real name — not uncommon
in Ireland, where my mother was born.
But Honor has been my pet name, — my

VOL. I. K

ATHERTON.

home name ; and it is to the home name
that the heart answers. '^

We used to christen children after the
virtues," said the old lady ; and it was a
good practice to remind them of their
duties."

** Ay," said Mr. Langton "such names
abound in those fertile records of manners,
the old comic writers, not always to edification.
That very name of Honor, for
instance, has been immortalized in Fielding's
great novel. But the Puritans
chiefly affected those appellations; and
from them the custom has prevailed
amongst their American descendants.
Faith, Hope, and Charity are common in
New England, to say nothing of Prudence
and Patience."

"We have a Patience in Atherton,"
observed Mrs. Bell ; " the greatest scold
in the parish — Patience Pratt. People
call her her Patty Pratt, and pretend that

her name is Martha ; but Patience she
was christened, though the name has done
her little good enough, as her husband
knows to his cost. If a woman is born to
be a vixen, it does not signify what you
cal her."

I shall hold by Honor, though," said
Katy. " Honor is a noble name, mamma.
I love it dearly."

And the poor governess felt that her
pupil was already her friend.

The stone hall opened into the front
passage, and another door, exactly opposite,
led into an apartment of equal dimensions
; which, cold, dreary, and formal-looking
in its stiff and scanty perishing,
its faded carpet, covering only half the
floor; its dark mahogany furniture; its
small Pembroke tables; its chairs and
settees, covered with white dimity, had
yet in height, and size, and aspect, all
that was required to convert the dismal

k 2

best parlour into the pleasant, cheerful,
family room.

Honor discovered this capability before
breakfast on the morning after her arrival;
and discovered also another passage at
right angles with the first, which led by
an old-fashioned glass door into the pretty
court, half turf, half flower-bed, which
swept round two sides of the house ;
parted from the kitchen-garden by a yew
hedge, over which appeared rows of espaliers
and groves of orchard trees, a
very forest of pear, apple, cherry, plum,
medlar, and walnut.

In the centre of the grass-plot, before
the glass door, surrounded by a narrow
border of mould, was an old 'sun-dial,
beneath which still lingered some of
Katy's beloved flowers. There knelt
Katy herself, trying to compose a little
bunch of such as yet remained, small
spikes of mignonette and winter violets,

and <sound>singing</sound> in a fresh, round voice, a
voice youthful and blooming as lier
cheeks, words new to Honor, but which
would have enraptured the heart of Mrs.
Glenham. It was an old Irish air, to
which, with more feeling for the music
than the metre, these irregular lines had
been adapted :

'' Good morrow! good morrow ! soft, rosy, and bright,
Glow the clouds in the east, <sound>laughing</sound> heralds of light ;
Whilst still, as the glorious colours decay,
Full gushes of music seem tracking their way.

Hark ! hark !
Is it the sheep bell among the ling ?
Or the early milkmaid carolling?

Hark ! hark !

Or is it the lark
As he bids the sun good-morrow ? "

On hearing Honor's <sound>step</sound>, the singer
paused suddenly, and flew to present her
little nosegay. They entered the house
together ; and when, after breakfast, Mr.
Langhton requested commissions for London,

and Honor had, by a delicate question,
suggested to Mrs. Warner the new-furnishing
the pleasant best parlour, to
which Mr. Langhton added a proposal to
convert the stone hall into a dining room ;
she said, to his surprise and pleasure :

Be sure amongst the new purchases
not to forget a piano."

"Ah! you have relented in your own
favour. I thought so."

''I have relented for the general good.
If you had been by the old sun-dial this
morning — "

Why, Katy ? Stop, my queen !' ' for
the little damsel showed symptoms of running
away. "Are you the songstress?
lN"ay, I must hear you."

I will accompany you," said Honor,
moving to fetch her guitar. And <sound>laughing</sound>,
stopping, and beginning afresh, they
got through the stanza.

Is not there another verse ?" enquired

ATHERTON. 135

-Mr. Langhton, after due praise of the
singer. ^^ Where did you pick up the
song?"

"Harry Glenham taught me," replied
Katy, with the most open simplicity. ^ ' He
wrote that stanza one day when we were
talking of the lark flying upward every
morning, as if to bid the sun good-morrow.
He wrote that verse to some old
air, and taught me to sing it ; and he
talked of finishing the song some day or
other. He often does begin things, and
talks of finishing them. Harry is idle.
His brother says that all poets are so;
that it belongs to their trade. He's very
good-natured though," continued Katy,
"and I like him."

If Mrs. Glenham had heard the tone in
which these words were spoken, she would
have despaired. It quite reassured the
careful guardian, who had begun to think
that singing Harry Glenham's songs

might put Artlrnr Delancy's interests in
jeopardy.

This discovery of Katy's musical talent
was no small comfort to her governess,
who, new to teaching, had justly dreaded
the invidious task of instructing one
equally new to the process of being
taught. "Now the lesson assumed the
pleasant form of amusement.

Herself an accomplished and enthusiastic
musician, she had brought with hera
goodly collection of vocal music, both
printed and manuscript, and in talking
over the books, and playing on the guitar
such airs as her young pupil wished to
hear, the hours glided by, easily to both
parties, happily to one ; to the other they
were too full of association to be without
pain.

Many languages found a place in this
miscellaneous collection, French, Italian,
German, Spanish, even Latin was there in

the shape of portions of the grand masses
of the Church of Some ; and to Honor's
great amazement, and a little to her
amusement, Katy, whose ignorance of all
modern tongues was so complete that
she had not distinguished one language
from the other, seized on a fine piece of
Church music, and began picking out the
words with a certain apprehension of the
meaning, and a sonorous English pronunciation
which would have horrified the
Italian composer.

"You know Latin, Katy ?''

"Only a very little," said Katy, producing
a well-thumbed Eton grammar.
Harry wanted to teach me ; but I soon
got tired, and mamma said it was boyish,
and grand mamma looked ready to laugh,
so I left off. The last time the boys were
at home they read to me, which I like a
great deal better than learning lessons, and
what I like I recollect. When I don't care
for a thing I forget it."

Here was another lesson in education.
Scott and Shakspeare were pleasant textbooks,
and much history and geography
were conveyed to the mind, in company
with such thoughts and such creations as
awakened every faculty in that fresh and
healthful nature. Poetry, above all, she
delighted in ; and poetry, real poetry, besides
the facts it leads to, is the finest
form of truth. So, reading with her pupil,
singing with her, walking with her, talking
with her, loving her, passed Honora's
days.

The graver and the sadder business of
life held on its way. Christmas brought
to Lord Delancy the threatened notice of
foreclosure unless the mortgages were redeemed
within six months. Separate
notices were also sent to the several tenants
on his various estates, to pay no more rent
after that period to him or to his agents.

The <sound>commotion</sound> occasioned by a proceeding

so unexpected equalled that caused by
Mr. Strange' s will. It took a form of regret
and affection honourable to all parties.
The nobleman, so proud and even haughty
with his equals, had been, as proud men
often are, most affable and most accessible
to his inferiors. Living much in the
country and amongst his own people, he
knew every farmer and every villager on
his extensive property. If he loved his
old trees, still better did he love the old
faces. An excellent landlord, the farmers
were sure of indulgence when it was
needed, and of justice, rarest of virtues,
always. The tradesman had custom ; the
labourer, employment ; the sick, attendance;
the children, instruction; the old,
relief. "When they met, after morning
service, in the churchyard, there was a
real and a hearty reciprocation of interest
in the respectful bows and curtsies which
greeted their good lord on every side, and

in the pleasant smiles and kindly "words by
which those rustic greetings were returned.
To lose such a Mend would be grief enough,
but to lose him for Sir Yivian, the ungrateful
kinsman, the treacherous usurper,
whom the old tenants remembered and of
whom all had heard, would be intolerable.
The storm of indignation was universal.
nobody could believe that English law
could tolerate such injustice. They thought
the whole story a fabrication.

Gradually this incredulity assumed a
more positive form. The absence of debt,
the regularity of payment, the disbelief of
the household, and the <sound>quiet</sound> manner with
which, in accordance with Mr. Langhton's
advice, the establishment at the Hall had
been kept up, without increase or diminution,
looked very unlike the proceedings of
a ruined man. And the shrewd ones
amongst them — Mrs. Gorham, for instance
— who watched the words of the

family at the farm, Katy's anger, her
mother's fury, ^Mj-s. Warner's <sound>quiet</sound> smile,
and Stephen Langhton's scornful shrug,
might give a tolerable guess as to the
manner in which the catastrophe would be
averted. So Lord Delancy, on his return
to Atherton, found little to remind him of
his precarious tenure except an increase of
reverence and devotion from all around
him; perhaps, to a man of his sensitive
temperament, the severest trial that he
could encounter.

By Katy he was greeted with delight,
although, to her exceeding disappointment
— for, like other spoilt children, she
expected all her pets to pet one another —
he got no farther with ]\Iiss Clive than a
ceremonious politeness, which she, shrinking
from him as from other strangers, repaid
with grave respect. Another subject
of lamentation with poor Katy was that
great English grievance, the weather. A

seasonable frost had set in, and she, longing
to see Marigold run, was wishing for an open
day as heartily as if she had been the whole
Quern Hunt. To comfort her, Lord De-fancy
resolved to turn the frost itself into
an amusement, and to have a skating party
upon Atherton mere. Lady Cardonnel and
Major Delancy were expected on the morrow,
and on the following day, Mrs. Warner,
together with the other ladies, promised
to attend. A close carriage was to convey
her and Mrs. Bell. The young ladies were
to walk.

CHAPTEE IX.

THE ICE.

There are wintry days in England which
have an indescribable beauty, and this was
one. The pervading charm was the work
of that great magician Hoar-frost. The
morning had been misty, but towards
noon the sun appeared, softened by a light
haze, which gave a pearly tint to the cloudless
blue sky, and accorded well with the
perfect tranquillity of the landscape. Not
a breath of air stirred ; and in the perfect
absence of wind, the degree of cold indicated
by the thermometer was hardly
felt.

There was, however, no tendency to
thaw. Eine was everywhere. The finest
patch of moss on the irregular park-paling,
the lichens that roughened the trunks of
the great trees that overhung the road,
had each its net work of delicate tracery.
The tawny leaves of the cut-leaved oak,
which still hung quivering on the lower
branches, were edged with its glittering
fringe. The old rugged fir, the leafy beech,
the tasselled birch, the bristly holly, the
purple bramble, the crisp brown fern, the
green grass of the park, all showed their
own varied colours and varied forms through
the same crystalline medium, contrasting
with the rich hues of the holly-berries,
the dark ivy-berry dear to the wood-pigeon,
and the crimson haws, which the
small birds love so well. In the <sound>stillness</sound>
of that woodland scene, the <sound>rustle</sound> of a
robin's wing, the dropping of a leaf from
the bushes was distinctly <sound>audible</sound>.

Thanks to the companionship of Jacob
Stokes, Katy knew every bird that visited
the hill, or dwelt in the valley; the
note, the habits, the nest, the eggs. It is
even likely, that had some wicked enchanter
imposed upon her the task of the
poor princess in the fairy tale, who was
commanded to select each bird's proper
feathers from a heap that filled a room,
she would have found the labour possible
a mere question of time — so extensive
was her knowledge of those winged tribes,
and so accurate her observation.

She pointed out to Honor that most
beautiful of British birds, a gorgeous kingfisher,
as he stooped to drink at a little
rivulet — a tiny spring issuing from beneath
the roots of a great beech, which went
trickling along almost hidden by coat overcoat
of thin translucent ice, until it was
lost in the winding stream, which, after
traversing great part of the park, was

VOL. I. L

merged in its turn in the wide waters of
the lake, now entirely frozen.

Katy's pockets were, as usual, filled
with bread and biscuits, which she crumbled
for her feathered clients; who, tamed
by the severity of the season, were alternately
attracted and repelled by their desire
of sharing in her bounty, and their
dread of Marigold, who, adorned in her
new collar, and proud of it as a child of a
necklace, gambolled round her young mistress
playful and graceful as a fawn.

The frozen lake was a pretty sight, with
its wooded islands, its mimic bays and
promontories, the grand old forest trees
between which it swept away into the distance,
and the masses of evergreens, laurel,
arbutus, cedar, cypress, or the light <sound>weeping</sound>-birch,
or <sound>weeping</sound> willow, of the foreground.

A beautiful sight always was Atherton
mere, and on occasion of this wintry festival,
it put forth signs of habitation such as

had not been seen there for many a long
day.

On one of the points of land that jutted
into the lake, hanging oyer the water, the
lower part a boat-house, and above a rustic
pavilion, stood an old grey fishing-house,
half covered with ivy and creeping shrubs,
backed by dark firs, and flanked on the farther
side by two poplars of colossal growth
and size, columns of vegetable beauty.

The smoke rose curling from the fishing
house, prepared for good Mrs. Warner, incase
of her feeling the cold too severe.
She had, however, preferred a seat outside
a tent in one of the sheltered bays;
and as they approached, the young ladies
saw at once that the travellers had arrived.


A large party of gentlemen were on
the lower part of the lake, where a group
of skaters and a number of country people
had assembled. Lord Delancy with

L 1

his usual courtesy, having issued a general j
invitation to such of the neighbours as |
chose to join the sports upon the ice ; the
pavilion and marquee being filled with i
seats and refreshments for the gentry,
and two or three tents in the background
amply provided with ale and solid Christmas
cheer for the villagers. j

Katy, always shy, held back a little as ;
they came near the lake. She dreaded a i
stranger. Honor insensibly drew her forward.
Poor Honor 1 her veil was down ; I
but the face was calmer than the heart.
Mrs. Bell and an elegant woman of middle j
age advanced to meet them ; and without
suffering her mother to speak, Lady .
Cardonnel took Katy's hand.

^^ People talk of children growing out
of knowledge," said she, "I have not seen
those dimpled cheeks these six years, but I
should have recognised them anywhere." \

And bending graciously to the govern

ness, she led the little heiress to a seat
next her grandmother. Mrs. Warner, always
considerate of the feelings of others,
and therefore always well-bred, said :

Will your ladyship permit me to present
to you a very dear young friend of
ours, whom I believe you to have seen
abroad ? Miss Clive, Lady Cardonnel."

bliss Clive ! Honora ! Honor Cere I
It is incredible ! it is impossible ! I
heard of you, I saw you with the
Lynmeres."

"And you find me in a far happier
home," said Honor. by-and-by I will
tell you the story. At present your ladyship
must play the hostess." And she
joined Mrs. Glenham, who introduced her
to the wife of a neighbouring clergyman,
and talked as people do talk of the weather
and the hoar frost, and the park, and
the lake, — everything except that of which
she was thinking.

At last Lady Cardonnel had disposed
of her guests. Some walked into the
pavilion ; some more daring ventured on
the ice, Mrs. "Warner, wrapped in fur
cloaks, remained in her old seat, talking
over schools of industry with the good
Eector, whose secret thoughts ever and
anon wandered away to theTroades, and the
matchless wailing of those Trojan women.
Katy, escorted by Lord Delancy, and accompanied
by her mother, tripped gaily
on to join the skaters, occasionally tempted
from her path by the less aristocratic
amu^fcx^ent offered by a troop of sliders
led by Jacob Stokes, — the very largest
slide she had ever seen. Her mother
held her tight lest the temptation might
prove too strong for human weakness.
And such perhaps it might have been,
but for a counter-temptation held out by
Lord Delancy, who not only promised hera
lesson in skating, but had actually provided

himself with a pair of such skates
as are used by the country girls in
Holland.

Lady Cardonnel had led her companion
into a retired walk.

Xow then, Honor, why are you here ?
After that double loss, which all lamented,
I heard of you with your aunt. I heard
of you as on the point of marriage to Sir
Philip Hervey."

'^ And you believed that report ?"

^^Xo. And I can understand why, refusing
such a match as Sir Philip, a
residence with the Lynmeres might become
painful. But why not go to your
uncle Eossborough ? Why not come to me ?''

" Dear Lady Cardonnel !"

" Why go out as a governess ? Why
come here?"

" Ah ! that I fear was an error. To
go as a governess was, I still believe,
right and wise. The loss of that dear

father, that dear brother, who were everything
to me, has left me destitute of
means as well as withered in affection.
Why should one absolutely penniless
shrink from earning her bread by honest
labour ? And nowhere could I be more
useful or more content than with these
kind people. Here, however, I should
not have come had I been aware of the
chance of meeting any old acquaintance,
even you, dear Lady Cardonnel. It seems
strange to say, but I had never heard of
LordDelancy in connection with Atherton,
nor of Atherton in connection with Lord
Delancy, until I arrived at the gate of my
new dwelling. If spoken of at all, it must
ave been as ^ The Hall,' in contradistinction
to 'The Castle.' The name of Delancy
first met my ear as I was at the very door
of my future residence. Then I endeavoured
to prevail on Mr. Langhton to take
me back again. I did not tell him all.

And since then I have tried to persuade
Mrs. Warner to let me return to town,
confessing frankly that I had received
much kindness from you, and that my
heart was not yet strong enough to meet
one who had known me before I was an
orphan."

And they refused to part with you ?"
" They would not hear of it. And
after all, why should I go ? ^Tiat harm
can result from my staying? Nobody
knows better than you, that before Major
Delancy's attentions to me had produced
the natural effect of such attentions from
such a man, I had become aware of my
own position, and of his. Ah, dearest
friend ! how can I ever thank you enough
for the frankness which saved me from
causing the misery of such a son, and such
a father ! Causing and sharing ! I knew
that the small portion which I inherited
from my mother was no longer mine, since

it was urgently needed by my poor brother
and my dear father. I knew that Major
Delancy was bound by every feeling of
duty not to add to his family distress by
marrying a portionless wife. I said, no,
when he asked me — an absolute, unconditional,
unexplained no. What man forgets,
what man pardons such a refusal ? And if
from my previous conduct he had derived
any encouragement, if he had guessed
from look, or tone, or word, that his proposal
would be only too pleasant to me, then
a thousand times more will he resent that
refusal, since he must attribute my previous
manner to heartless coquetry* Since
I have been here, I have gathered in a
hundred ways from Mr. Langhton and
these artless people, that the need of
money at the Hall is more urgent than
ever, and that a marriage is arranged
between the young heiress and the heir.
Look at her, and look at me. She is as

good as she is pretty, as charming as she is
good. Besides, no man ever pardons such
a refusal. He Avill but treat me as his
father does, with cold civility. I will go tonight
if you think it right. Be assured
that I will do all I can to promote the
match, for they are worthy of each other.
But I know that no man ever pardons a
refusal without an assigned cause, and I
think that I shall promote it best by staying.
Do what you will with me, dear
Lady Cardonnel. I have told you all.
Send me away at once if you see fit."
And, paler than ever, Honor ceased. She
had poured forth this confession of feeling
with an emotion most unusual to her, and
stood waiting the decision of her friend,
who had listened to her with the deepest
sympathy, when a sudden <sound>outburst</sound> from
the lake of many <sound>voices</sound>— in which <sound>cries</sound> of
distress from Katy, and <sound>calls</sound> between
fright and scolding from Mrs, Bell, were

distinctly <sound>audible</sound> — put a sudden and unexpected
stop to their dialogue.

They had purposely sought a retired
footpath on the opposite side of the mere
from that where the pavilion and the tents
were situated, and which, although following
the general outline of the water, was
yet concealed from it partly by the irregularities
of the ground, partly by clumps of
cedars, and masses of arbutus and Portugal
laurel, partly by brakes of hawthorn and
holly, the natural growth of the soil.

If they had not been engrossed by the
interest taken by both in the subject of
their discourse, they might have discovered
from the mingled <sound>hum</sound> of many <sound>voices</sound>, and
the gay <sound>shouts</sound> of the country lads, that
they were now nearly opposite that part of
the lake which for thickness and smoothness
had been selected by skaters, sliders,
and spectators, as the principal scene of
the morning's diversion.



Major Delancy, a splendid skater, after
enjoying for a short space the exhilaration
of an exercise in which he excelled, had
with the utmost good humour left a party
of the neighbouring gentlemen, who had
crossed the downs for the purpose, and with
whom he had been executing on the ice
the different figures in which proficient
delight, in order to give a lesson in the
mystery of cutting initials and spread
eagles on that glassy surface to Harry and
Charles Glenham, and some other youths
of their age, when he was summoned by
his father to attend Katy and Mrs. Bell.

About the skating ground, as has been
said, the ice was perfectly safe. But farther
down the mere, the bank, overhung
by a large <sound>weeping</sound> willow, jutted out
abruptly, and, probably from a spring
which fed the waters, the ice was so
much thinner, that the spot had been
staked out by tall sticks, surmounted by

little red flags in token of danger. The
space that was perfectly safe was so extensive
that there did not appear the slightest
cause to apprehend that anybody would
stray out of bounds.

Pets, however, are proverbially wilful.
Marigold, after playing every conceivable
prank around her mistress on dry ground
chasing the birds in the woodland,
jumping after squirrels on the tree-tops,
and trying to coax a dappled fawn into a
game at romps — had followed her <sound>footsteps</sound>
on the ice; and a little puzzled by the slippery
smoothness, and daunted at the numbers
assembled, had bounded forward until
she reached the interdicted spot, the very
point of danger, where the glassy surface,
yielding even to her light weight, gave
way more and more under her struggles ;
the ice sinking as the water rose, until at
last the frightened favourite seemed to be
totally immersed in the mere.

At this moment it was — whilst Katy was
darting on to save her pet, and Mrs. Bell
screaming to her to desist — that Lady-card
onnel and Honor found themselves on
the edge of the lake, a little in advance of
the mother and daughter, but still short
of the scene of danger.

^^ Oh ! Miss Clive, save my Katy ! '*
shrieked Mrs. Bell. And Honor, first
making a sign to Jacob Stokes, who was
as usual close to his young mistress,
bounded on the ice, and favoured by their
mutual position, was able to seize her young
pupil round the waist ; thus checking her
first impulse, and gaining time to exert
the influence which she, and she only,
possessed over that adventurous damsel,
and to lead her gently towards her
mother.

^^ Look, dearest ; the danger is in the
numbers who are hurrying to rescue your
pretty darling. See ! Harry is on firm

ice, and he has got hold of her now. Yes !
he has hold of her collar ; and Charles,
with his arms round his brother's waist, is
steadying Harry."

A rush of people came between,
and the girls lost sight of the scene of
danger. But a tenable <sound>cry</sound> announced
that the ice had given way under one at
least of the eager boys. Deadly peril was
in every glimpse they caught, and in every
<sound>sound</sound> they heard. Their senses reeled
with the suspense and the fear, which
seemed prolonging moments into hours.

Another rush gave them a view of Major
Delancy on the bank, throwing, with all
the power of his toland vigorous frame, a
long ladder across the space between the
<sound>sound</sound> ice and the shore. In an instant he
had drawn one brother from the dangerous
pool, had lent a helping-hand to the other ;
and then, clinging to the long shoots of the
willow, and making himself a desperate

plunges lie reappeared, bearing the unlucky
cause of this <sound>commotion</sound>, the dripping,
trembling marigold, under his arm.

The whole scene passed in a shorter
time than has been given to the narration.

It was the ladder did it all, dear Dr.
Glenham ! " said he, as the agitated father
vainly sought to thank him for saving one
if not both his boys. " The ladder saved
them, under Providence, not I ; and the
person who in the midst of this confusion
directed me to this same ladder, and
would have flung it himself if he had been
strong enough, was this good little boy."

Jacob Stokes, not in general addicted to
shyness, stole away from the good Doctor's
gifts and praises, as if he had been caught
in some misdeed, muttering as he turned
over his money — for the Eector had
emptied his purse into his hand — " that it
was Miss who showed him the ladder, and
he had no business to be thanked for her

VOL. I. M

doings, nor to take the guineas and half-crowns."


My young friends will be the better
for a glass of brandy, sir," said Major
Delancy to his father; "and so will
Dr. Glenham. I am an old campaigner,
and know the virtues of cognac. In the
meantime, I must take Marigold to Miss
Warner."

She would have been in the water,
too," exclaimed Mrs. Bell, " if it had not
been for her good governess, God bless
her!"

And thus, after three years' absence,
did Arthur Delancy meet Honor Clive.
Her governess !" He had almost dropt
the shivering creature that he held. But
Honor had augured justly. The pride of
a refused man came to his assistance. He
bowed slightly but respectfully, and recommended
transporting the dripping greyhound
to the fishing house, where she
could be dried before the fire.

Honor, to whom Katy still flung, was
at last able to escape to Mrs. Warner and
Mrs. Glenham, each of whom had caught
the <sound>sound</sound> of a vague alarm, a rumour of
unexplained peril, and both were greatly-solaced
by receiving a clear and truthful
account of the adventure. There was
nothing now amiss except two wet jackets,
which had better be changed.

Mrs, Glenham, eager to see her boys,
and Mrs. Warner, desirous not to lose
sight of her heedless granddaughter, were
encountered at the entrance of the tent by
the good Eector and Jacob, anxious to
restore to the right owner the praises bestowed
upon himself for discovering the
ladder.

^"Twas Miss, there," quoth the boy;
^^ she made a sign to me, and I told the
Major."

Jacob lost nothing with any party by
his honesty ; and Mrs. Warner, now for

M 2

the first time hearing from the Doctor
Honor's share in holding back Katy, said
emphatically —

"I believe, my dear, that there is no
good deed in-which you have not a part."

If Honor had before doubted as to her
line of conduct, this confidence would have
decided her.

Nearly at the same moment, a still
stronger revulsion took place in another
young heart. Harry Glenham had been
told by his father the suspicion which he
himself entertained of Lord Delancy's desire
to gain the hand of the heiress for his
heir. He had been reminded that he was
indebted to his kind patron not merely fora
valuable living, but for a key of his
magnificent library, the privilege perhaps
dearest to him of any on earth ; and for
the thousand daily attentions and kindnesses
which sweeten life between country
neighbours. The father's appeal had been

felt by the high-spirited boy, but felt as
we all feel "words. What had happened
that morning was a living act. As he
thanked Major Delancy for the life which
he owed to his bold heart and vigorous
arm, and as the young soldier pressed his
hand and declared that the joy was his,
he inwardly vowed to go back to Cambridge,
bury himself in his studies, and
never suffer a thought of his pretty playfellow
to cross his fancy again.

Is it needful to say that the mother's
heart made the same renunciation ?

Chapter X,

MUSIC BOOKS.

The arrival of Lady Cardonnel tended
much to facilitate the intercourse between
the Hall and the Farm. The perfect breeding
of the court lady, and the simplicity
of Mrs. Warner, had so much in common
and, in either case, there was so great a
fund of goodness and sincerity, that mutual
respect and esteem grew up between
them.

Lady Cardonnel, poor Lady Delancy^s
favourite sister, was a widow, whose children
— the daughters married, and the sons

in the naval, military, and diplomatic service
of their country — were literally scattered
all over the face of the earth, so that
her brother-in-law's house was more her
home than any other abode, and his interests
as much her own as if they had been
united by the ties of blood. She had spent
the three years of the occupation of France
with her youngest daughter, the wife of
an officer in Arthur's regiment, and there
she had become sincerely attached to her
high-minded nephew, and hardly less so
to Honor Clive ; and it was because she
loved both so well, that she joined Stephen
Langhton in his endeavours to bring about
the union with Katy, foreseeing nothing
but misery on either side, in the renewal
of an affection which would bring ruin to
his worldly prospects, and break his
father's heart. Her advice to her young
friend had been to remain at Atherton, the
rather that Major Delancy's manner to her

was as cold as was consistent with gentlemanly
courtesy. If not indifference, it
was a resentment so chilling and so persevering
as to answer the same purpose.

The good lawyer also was frequently
at the Hall, and upon these occasions the
two families were brought into still closer
connexion. Sometimes they walked together
; sometimes they drove, and then
good Mrs. Warner was seduced into joining
the party : still more frequently the
younger ladies rode on horseback. Major
Delancyhad redeemed Mrs. Bell's promise,
by causing a beautiful mare to be trained
tinder his own inspection for her daughter's
use. His groom had been seen, equipped
with riding-skirt and side-saddle, cantering
across the park at so wild a rate, that
Jacob Stokes, not suspecting the disguise,
paid his young mistress the equivocal compliment
of declaring that it could be nobody
but Miss Katy. The creature had

become so great a favourite, tliatthe *^ Faery
Queen" had been ransacked to find a name
to match her grace and symmetry; and as
if conscious of the affection lavished upon
her, Britomarte seemed never so happy as
when cantering with her fair rider over
the downs every day and all day long.

Of course the gentlemen attended at
these momiDg rides, and very often the
party at the Farm were invited to an unceremonious
dimmer. In return, the small
family at the Hall would drink tea with
their humbler neighbours. !Neo influence
short of Honor's could have restrained
Mrs. Bell's desire to extend to them a far
larger portion of hospitality. One day she
beheld her turning over the leaves of an
ancient-looking cookery book, meditating
eggs and bacon in blancmange, and a floating
island in whipt cream, besides a dozen
other rustic luxuries culled from a family
collection of choice recipes, and the

slaughter of a hecatomb of poultry, from
Katy's pigeons up to the last turkey of
the season. Lucky birds ! that talk between
Miss Clive and Mrs. Bell saved
their lives.

It was now, to date as Katy did by
flowers, about the time when snowdrops,
hepaticas, crocuses, and the winter-aconite,
were circling round the old sun-dial in
the garden, primroses covering the sunny
banks, violets perfuming the hedgerows,
and daffodils crowding round the orchard
trees ; and the usual party were assembled
in the pleasant parlour at the Farm, fragrant
with the violets which she had stolen
from the park, when Mr. Langhton addressed
Katy with a question which seemed
innocent enough, but which would have
startled a more experienced young lady,
as the foreigner of a very unwelcome request.


" Pray, my queen, did you ever get the

remainder of the good-morrow' song
from your Atherton poet ? — the idle member
of an idle fraternity, as his brother
Charles very justly called him."

Katy stood up womanly for her poor
Mend; and Arthur, who had taken a
fancy to the lad from the moment he had
pulled him out of the water, as indeed he
had done by Marigold (a generous spirit
does love those whom it has served), made
common cause in his defence.

Lord Delancy, pleased with everything
that tended to bring into closer familiarity
the couple whom he so ardently wished to
unite, joined in the conversation caused by
Mr. Langhton's question, and expressed
a desire to hear the song.

Xo," replied Katy, '' the song was
never finished." And then she repeated
the stanza.

'^ Sing it," said her guardian.

But Katy blushed and <sound>laughed</sound>, and
looked ^^^N'o," although she did not speak it;

she looked, too, as if determined, for once
in her life, to be obstinate.

*^ Sing it, and Miss Clive will accompany
you," said her grandmother, as Honor
took her seat at the instrument.

^^ Sing it, and Miss Clive will help you'*
said Mrs. Bell. *^ Sing it, or we shan't
love you."

^ ^ Won't you ! " said Katy 's loving, saucy
glance, as plainly as ever eye spoke yet.

'sing it, my Katy, if you love me,"
whispered Honor.

Katy, unable to resist that adjuration,
began; but before she got through the
"Good-morrow," stopped suddenly. Honor,
accustomed to her fits of fright, continued
the accompaniment for a few bars, and then
said to Mr. Langhton —

'' That burthen seems to have taken hold
of Mr. Henry's imagination; for on inquiring
of Mrs. Glenham if she could furnish
us with the remainder of the ' Good-morrow'
song, she produced another, which I

have copied into this book. Suppose we
try that, Katy ? I think !Mr. Langhton
will like the air." And not giving her
time to become frightened, she launched
her dexterously into the song.

Give thee good-morrow, busy bee !

No cloud is in the sky,
The ring-dove skirts across the lea,

The matin lark soars high ;
Gay sunbeams kiss the dewy flower,

Light breezes stir the tree,
And sweet is thine own woodbine bower, —

Good-morrow, busy bee !

Give thee good-even, busy bee I

The summer day is by,
Now droning beetles haunt the lea

And <sound>shrieking</sound> plovers <sound>cry</sound>.
The light hath paled on leaf and flower,

The night-wind chills the tree,
And thou, well-laden, leav'st thy bower, —

Good-even, busy bee !

The Hall party, to whom Katy's <sound>singing</sound>
was a surprise, were enraptured with the

young, fresh voice, and the perfect articulation.


Is it not as if we were transported to
Isaac Walton's times, and were sitting in
the meadows by the river Lea, listening to
one of the milkmaids ?" inquired the old
lawyer of Lord Delancy.

Like a commentary upon the observation.
Honor began playing the symphony
of Haydn's beautiful canzonet ^^ My mother
bids me bind my hair," which, although
not called so, is as fully a pastoral as
Isaac Walton's book.

*scan you sing any duets. Miss Warner?
I am sure you can. Arthur, come here and
sing with Miss Warner."

Arthur had been sitting in the darkest
comer of the room, his elbow on a table,
and his head leaning on his hand, as if absorbed
by the <sound>music</sound>.

Honor opened another book at the
^^ Canzonets of Jackson of Exeter," and

Atherton. ]75

placed " Love, in thine eyes" open before
her.

Again Lord Delancy summoned his son ;
and this time he obeyed, going through
his task with the skill and taste of a perfect
musician. Katy was again slightly
nervous; but Honor, to use Mi's. Bell's
phrase, 'helped her," supplying a momentary
deficiency and concealing a little flaw,
much as a professed singing mistress
might have done, if ever singing mistress
had had so true an interest in her pupil.

Lady Cardonnel, also summoned to help
in ^^0 IN'annie," and other charming part
songs, leaned over Honor and whispered :

"swill not you sing?"

I have never sung, except, as now, a
few notes to aid, or an entire air by way of
lesson, since I lost him with whom we
used to sing at Valenciennes."

"Ay," said Lady Cardonnel, "this is
the old book ;" and hanging over Colonel

Delancy's shoulder, she turned over the
leaves and read the titles, ^^ Time has not
thinned;" stake, oh take those lips
away;" " Do not unbind two gentle hearts;"
whilst another voice murmured ^^ Poor
Lionel !"

Many weeks had not passed before Katy
added some of Mozart's finest duets to her
stock: "La ci dare," "Ah persona,"
^^Ah guard sorely," and ^^Ti veggo,"
from "Winter's '^ Ease of Proserpine." It
is doubtful whether the delightful expression
of her English songs, admirable inarticulation
and feeling, or the imperfection
of her fresh-caught Italian, were most
attractive. But a deeper charm than
either was to be found in the sympathy
for her friend with which she avoided
speaking on any subject connected with
former performances of this music. She
had heard from Lady Cardonnel that Captain
Clive, the brother whom Honor loved

SO well, had been accustomed to sing with
her. She recognised the sort of family
likeness which often distinguishes handwriting
in some manuscript German songs.
Other MSS. there were also. But Katy
had learnt to read the sensibility under
the self-command of her governess's character,
and avoided all trying subjects with
the tact which is born of the heart.

CHAPTEE XI.

SKETCH BOOKS.

Let us take another turn under the
lime-trees," said Katy to her governess
one Sunday afternoon returning from
church, when they had reached the end
of the fine avenue where the sunbeams
played through the half opening leaves,
casting a chequered light on the broad
gravel road; for by this time cowslips
and distilleries threw their bright colours
on the grass. "Do not let us go in
just yet. Mamma will take grandmamma
home, and we will follow after one more
turn."

Mrs. "Warner had been leaning on
Honor's arm, and Katy was following
side by side "with her mother when she
made this proposal.

With all my heart," said Mrs. Bell;
"I cannot have a worse companion than
yon, Katy, for you have not spoken a
word. What have yon been thinking
about?"

^^ Nothing, mamma," responded the
little beauty, as the four ladies parted,
according to her arrangement: ^^^N^othing
at aU."

Now this answer, which is in the very
spirit of young lady's, the answer which
every girl of sixteen returns by instinct to
that question when conscious that she has
been thinking of any object a little too
much, was entirely out of Katy's way ;
that fair damsel being one who, partly
from the indulgence of those about her,
partly from natural frankness, had never

N 2

known the weight of a secret in her life.
Accordingly, those two simple words,
nothing, mamma," made a strong impression
upon one at least of her hearers.

Honor, however, knew that in these
cases the best way to get at the truth is
not always to ask for it. So she waited ;
and after they had walked a short distance
arm in arm, a sudden question offered
some hint as to the subject of her pupil's
meditations.

"Do you think Major Delancy handsome
?" said she.

The answer was such as to encourage a
farther confidence.

Certainly. I believe that every one
thinks him so."

"I never did till to-days' resumed
Katy, with her old frankness. "Though,
to be sure, I have always been too much
afraid of him to stare him in the face.
But this afternoon as he sat in the comer

of that great chancel pew, with his head
thrown back, and his eyes cast down, the
light as it streamed through the tall window
falling right upon his temple, and the
curls pushed away from his high forehead,
I thought that he looked very
noble ; calm and kind as a soldier ought
to look."

'^ As a soldier ought to be," observed
Honor, '^ and as I believe he is. Nothing
can be higher than his character in the
regiment. He is beloved by officers and
men."

^^ Don't you think," continued Katy,
that he is like one of the heads in your
Vasari, those grand old heads of the
sculptors and painters, which are to a
certain extent alike ?"

Perhaps so. We will look them over
when we get home."

'- Though, why they should be like a
soldier — "

Except," intermitted Honor, " that
they were soldiers of a nobler army — art
that creates, not war that destroys. And
I that say this am a soldier's daughter''
added she, smiling ; " but it is the truth,
or that which I believe to be so."

Just then the object of their praise, his
father, and Lady Cardonnel were seen coming
up the avenue, with Dr. and Mrs.
Glenham, for whom they had waited.
Katy's shyness returned at the sight, and
but for Honor's better judgment, she would
certainly have run away home. On meeting
the party, Lord Delancy took immediate
possession of the young heiress, and
offering her his arm, insisted on her accompanying
them to the Hall.

We are old-fashioned people," said he,
and dine at luncheon time on Sundays ;
and Dr. and Mrs. Glenham have had the
goodness to return with us to coffee. I am
to show her some fine German and Italian

prints. They are mostly on Scripture subjects,
and would please Mrs. "Warner.
Don't you think that if Arthur should
drive the pony-chaise to the farm, he might
prevail on her and Mrs. Bell to join
us ? At all events, I shall detain you asa
hostage."

And overcoming her feeble show of
opposition, he conducted her to the
mansion.

Major Delancy speedily returned from
his expedition, only half successful. The
good grand mamma was fatigued; but
Mrs. BeU, never more completely at ease
than with the young soldier, who struck
such awe into her daughter, entered the
drawing-room in the highest spirits.

'' I tel you, Major, that men are all
alike," exclaimed she, finishing a dispute
which had lasted the whole way. "I
have had two husbands, and am a woman
of experience ; and I maintain that grave

or gay, rough or smooth, talkative or <sound>silent</sound>,
they have all the same fault, they will have
their own way. There was my first
husband, Katy's father, who was so gentle
and so <sound>quiet</sound>, 1 did not think he could have
spoken two words at a time. Well! he
had a way of his own, I promise you. And
then there was my second spouse, such a
giddy whirligig, that I did not believe he
would ever stay long enough in a place to
make up his mind to anything. Well!
he too had a way of his own, and he would
have it. Men are all alike, young ladies,
all alike, the very best of them."

*^ Poor Mrs. Bell !" said Lord Delancy.

Poor papa !" cried Katy.

After coffee they repaired to the print
room, where a splendid collection of the
finest and rarest engravings in the world,
were ranged upon double desks, round the
spacious apartment. Mr. Dillon has
since shown what money and taste can do

when they meet in an English merchant.
What an art it is that diffuses beauty as
well as thought, giving to these representatives
of great pictures a home in overland,
and a chance of duration infinitely
multiplied ! That colourless and silent
poetry, how it appeals to the heart ! — the
great painters with their fiery etchings !
and they who, slow and patient masters of
their own high art, almost equalled on the
copper the masterpiece they copied !

Lord Delancy, chiefly devoting himself
to Mrs. Glenham, left the other ladies to
the care of his son ; for the dear Doctor
had fallen upon Flaxman's Homer, and had
forgotten that any woman had been born
since the Siege of Troy.

Lady Cardonnel took charge of her
younger visitors, ministering with almost
equal delight to the cultivated taste of one
fair companion, and the uncultivated
intelligence of the other, full of the

eager questions which, it is so pleasant to
answer.

Major Delancy, for his share, undertook
to amuse Mrs. Bell, who, it is sad to say,
yawned over the fine Marc-antonio, the
huge Rembrandt, and the tiny waterloo,
and set all the efforts of her cavalier
at nought, until he bethought him of a
certain English magician, called Hogarth,
powerful in cases of ennui, and brought
forward a complete set of the great
humorist, valuable for every sort of
quality, rarity, condition, and former
possessors (for many of these single
impressions had a pedigree), as well as for
the satire and the invention which have
made the painter immortal.

Mrs. Bell was charmed. She had the
English feeling of character, and that
happened to her which has befallen many
another gazer at those prints. She knew
the baker's boy, whose tray is overset, and

had been well acquainted with the old
maid going to church on a frosty morning.

Mrs. Bell went on menily giving names
to Hogaii:h's figures, until the costume or
the attitude of the principal character in
^^ Strolling Players dressing in a barn,"
awakened another English feeling, called
decorum.

"Fie, fie, Major!" exclaimed the irate
dame, "look at the shameless hussy tying
up her garter before everybody: fie, fie!"

'' Dear Mrs. Bell, it's only to show the
hole in her stocking," observed the Major,
in a deprecating tone. ^ ' Poor wretches, it's
just to set forth the mixture of finery and
penury. Look at the tin crown, and "

"I'll look at nothing," declared Mrs.
Bell, shutting the portfolio with a <sound>slam</sound> of
virtuous indignation. " Suppose Katy
should come."

Roused by the <sound>slam</sound> of the portfolio,
which resided through the room, and

by the <sound>clamour</sound> of her mother's voice,
Katy did arrive, followed with more or less
dispatch by the entire company. The
Major had contrived to suppress all symptoms
of a smile round his mouth, but
there was a glimmer of <sound>laughter</sound> in his
eyes which showed that the outcry had not
proceeded from any very serious cause.
He left Mrs. Bell to tell her own story;
and instead of returning to the grievance,
which would probably have ended in the
production of the delinquent figure, she
reminded Lord Delancy that he had promised
Katy a sight of the Major's sketchbooks.


Katy enforced the demand.

^^I had not forgotten my promise," said
Lord Delancy. '' I made my son bring
them to me only yesterday. They are in
the library now." And sending a servant
for four or five volumes of clasped books,
he laid them before Lady Cai-donnel.

Two or three volumes of very beautiful
landscape drawings, chiefly of lake and
mountain scenery, with here the ruin of a
temple, there of an aqueduct ; here an
Italian villa, there a Eoman bridge : such
scenes as may be found in the Liber Veritatis,
the magazine in which Claude secured
those treasures of grace and beauty
which he afterwards transferred to this
grand compositions. Two or three volumes
of this character were readily displayed,
with no further deprecation than
that of an amateur who knows perfectly
the limits of his power.

They are merely reminiscences of
scenery," said he, " done for my own
gratification; as part, indeed, of a military
and travelling diary; and without any pretension
to artistic merit."

Under one or two the names of the
places were written, and Katy exclaimed
as, in soliloquy :

That's the same handwriting with the
Spanish songs in Honor's music-book."

Major Delancy was relating to Mrs. Bell
some anecdote connected with the scene,
and did not hear her observation.

Having gone through all but one of the
sketch-books, he was about to put aside
that which remained, unexamined, when
the clasp unclosed, and Katy broke into
raptures at the sight of the fine old Flemish
town which it exhibited.

This is worth all the rest," cried she.
" Look at those curious tall houses, with
the narrow-peaked gables, which seem set
sideways to the street ; the strange doorways,
the pretty windows, the twisted
chimneys, the odd figures on the spouts,
the stone galleries here and there, the
carved balconies everywhere; — only look!
Then the spirit and the truth ; the people
on the causeway; we can see them! The
sunshine and the shadow; they are really

to be felt. Look, Honor : this is worth
aU the rest."

But Honor had drawn back her chair.

*' Lady Cardonnel/' said Arthur, in a low
voice, 'shut that book. It never ought to
have been opened."

Not on my account, Lady Cardonnel,"
said Honor. '' Shew Katy the old Belgian
towns. The first sight of those drawings
reminded me of the days when they were
taken — days when I was rich in a dear
father and a dear brother. But what is
our whole life if not a memory of past happiness?
And should not the gifts and
virtues of those loved and lost be cherished
as a blessing, not turned from as a curse ?
Show Katy the towns."

She passed through an open French
window, and sate in the shadow of the
colonnade, looking over the park.

MajorDelancyknew Miss Clive, then?"
whispered Katy.

^^ Yes ; she was with her father and brother
when they were quartered at Valenciennes,
where Arthur's regiment was also
stationed. It was there that I made her
acquaintance. Captain Clive and my
nephew were most intimate, as you may
guess from their* haying made sketching
excursions together, and often worked
upon the same drawing."

*• Poor Honor," sighed Katy.

Yes, she loved her brother dearly; he
was indeed a most gifted creature. She
has since lost both him and her father."

'^ Dear Honor!"

Lady Cardonnel then directed her
companion's attention to some highly
graphic representations of Flemish and
German towns : Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges,
Nuremberg, in which the spirited and
brilliant pencilling caught the young
girl's fancy more than the poetical feeling
displayed by the owner of the book in

lake and mountain scenery, where the
treatment of atmospheric effects, the
clouds, the waterfalls, the distant hills,
was often masterly.

At last, in a sketch by Major Delancy
of one of the Moorish cities of Spahis,
Seville or Granada, a loose card, wrapped in
silver paper, provoked Katy's curiosity.
It was a profile of a young English
officer, the pure outline of whose features
was too familiar to her to be mistaken.
The initials L. C. were written underneath.


^^ Lionel Clive exclaimed Lady Car-donne
a moment after.

"How like Honor'' burst from the
two ; for Mrs. Bell had long forsaken the
books she had demanded, and was sitting,
in peaceful slumber on a distant sofa;
and from the moment that Lioness drawings
had been exhibited, Arthur had held
aloof.
VOL. I. o

As they were replacing the card, they
saw another profile, slightly touched on
the reverse, a female head, with the hair
braided as in the Greek statues.

Honor herself ! '' cried Katy. ^^ I
wonder if she knows it''

Meanwhile, the peaceful hour and the
peaceful scene aided in restoring the poor
governess to tranquillity. The rich perfume
of plants from the conservatories
blended with the thousand natural sweetness
of spring in the woods. Nightingales
answered each other from brake
to thicket, and mixed with the soothing
fall of a fountain, whose jets were silvered
by the moonbeams. . Light and shadow
seemed softened in the park. All was
harmony, till a stern voice spoke at the
window, apparently in answer to some
kind remark of Lady Cardonnel.

'^ Do not tell me of tears, Margaret !

They are oftener shed for the liyiug than
the dead."

This was a defiance to good or to evil,
and so it was felt by Honora. This time
no tears fell.

CHAPTER XII.

A Y0T7NG lady's Book-shelves.

Three or four days after this scene, Mr.
Langhton presented himself at an early-hour
in Major Delancy's dressing-room.
He had anived by a night coach at the
nearest town, and had driven to the Hall
in aU haste.

" Arthur," said he, dismissing the
valet, ^^ this affair must be brought at once
to a conclusion. I have not thought fit to
speak on the subject to your father, because
I know as well as you the danger
to his health of all transitions of hope and

fear. But I tell you plainly that dangers
are looming in the distance. The adverse
solicitors throw out hints, which of course
we are not the last to hear. Sir Yivian, I
knows is hanging about this neighbourhood,
hatching mischief, according to his
nature. Think, if your father should
catch sight of him before this marriage is
finally arranged, what might be the consequence.
I, as you know, do not hold
myself justified, as executor or as guardian,
to advance so immense a sum until at least
the settlements are signed. In short, the
formal proposal must be made at once. I
do not see any danger of refusal. The
mother and grandmother are strongly with
you ; and the young lady certainly likes
no man better, aimless it be your father.
Follow her in her afternoon walk, and
find or make an opportunity. I shall
back to my proper work of drawing deeds;
and a snap of the fingers," continued he,

suiting the action to the word, " for Sir
Vivian and his devices ! ''

So departing, without leaving time for
reply, the good lawyer drove briskly to
the Farm.

Thither, a few hour's after, we follow him.

Now dearest Mrs. Bell, whose genial
and hearty character had borne so well the
broad sunshine of prosperity, rejoicing
in Katy's good fortune, and trying to
make all around her as happy as herself —
that dear and excellent Mrs. Bell had her
little foibles, as all women ought to have.
It is only Queen Elizabeth who, in the
plenitude of her royal grandeur and her
royal vanity, desired to be painted
without shadow. Our Mrs. Bell was no
Queen Elizabeth ; and the shade that
throw into relief the broad lights of her
honest countenance, was the least spice,
the smallest spice in the world, of mistrust
of her neighbours. She did not hate

them ; she did not steak ill of them ; but
she was a little addicted to suspecting
them of hating'and speaking ill of her : in
short, she had always a Mrs. Grundy.
At the commencement of our story, Mrs.
Glenham had filled that ungracious part ;
but matters having righted in that quarter,
especially since the accident on the ice,
the reigning Mrs. Grundy was no other
than her old gossip and crony, Mrs.
Thorpe, wife of the miller, whose bell-team
had been eclipsed by the famous
horses purchased by Katy's orders, who
now drew Mrs. Bell's waggon to the next
market town, as proudly as if it had been
a dray of Barclay and Perkins, or the Lord
Mayor's coach. It is just possible that
the bell-team in question, whose paraphernalia
had never been equalled in
Atherton, might have inflicted certain
pangs of jealousy on Mrs. Thorpe, and
that the ill-will was not wholly on one

side — wHch, speaking from a pretty long
experience, it may be assumed that ill-will
seldom is.

Peace and harmony reigned in the
pleasant morning room. Mrs. "Warner,
with her Bible before her, and her knitting
on her lap ; Mr. Langhton whiting a letter,
which, from his deep attention, seemed
important ; and Katy, at her own desire,
attempting, under Honor's patient direction,
a simple accompaniment to one of
herein songs. All on a sudden, a storm
entered from the village, in the person of
Mrs. Bell, red-hot with anger.

^^WellP' quoth she, "what will that
woman say next''

'' What woman, dear Mi's. Bell ? ''

What woman, mamma ? " iaquii-ed
the young ladies, almost simultaneously.

" Mrs. Thorpe ! " was the reply. '^ She
calls us all the bad names that ever were
heard of — bad names out of the Bible !
wicked that she is ! "•

^ All owing to those horses of yours, Katy, ' '
said Stephen, looking up from his letter.
*' IN'ow you've beaten her husband's team
so thoroughly, Mrs. Bell, you can afford to
be generous, and let her jingle the bells."

^^She calls us bad names out of the
Bible I" repeated the angry lady; sand
says that I am as proud as Jezebel, and shall
come to the same end. And she says bad
things of you, Sir : she says, that not content
with calling Katy a queen (and I'm
sure you've called her so these dozen years)
you are setting her up like one, and have
got an Earl's daughter for her governess.
And then she talks nonsense out of a playbook,
and tells of some old ^^dcked wretch
who set up his daughter in the same way,
With a decayed gentlewoman for her
serving-maid. To think of telling untruths
of dear Miss Clive ! She might say
what she liked of me ; but to speak falsehoods
of her, and call her a serving-maid
and an earl's daughter ! "

^^ Any one who spoke ill of Miss Clive
must tell an untruth," observed Mrs.
Warner, perceiving that Mr. Langhton
looked perplexed, and that Honor, with
an expression between a blush and a
smile, seemed hesitating what to say.

" Honor ! " said Katy, flinging her arms
round her friend's neck, ^^ Dear Honor !
can this be true ?"

'^ Ingot wholly true," was the reply, senor
yet altogether false. I am not an Earl's
daughter, Katy. Eut would you love
me less if my mother had been such ? I
never meant to deceive you, dearest Mrs.
Warner. When Mr. Langhton enquired
for a governess of my friend and schoolfellow,
Mrs. Osborne, she told him that I
was in want of such a situation. My poor
mother, dead long ago, had been the
youngest of many children. My father,
a younger brother of good family, was a
colonel in the army. When he too died, I
remained penniless."

" Add' broke in Stephen, ^^that she
had given up her mother's portion that
her father might purchase a company for
her brother, and pay certain unavoidable
debts and losses."

Honor pressed his hands.

" Lady Lucy Lynmere, my mother's
half-sister, took me to live with her ; but
there I could not stay."

Because she refused a booby and a
dolt," again interrupted IVL:. Langhton.

'' And then I came here," said Honor ;
where I have found dear friends and a
happy home. Indeed I did not mean to
deceive you, Mrs. Warner. Indeed, indeed,
Mrs. Bell, I never dreamt of concealment.
Katy, you will not love me less, my Katy,
for this accident of birth ? I do not love
you less for being rich."

Mrs. Bell was on the point of giving
vent to a whole volume of flourishing
apologies about the tent-bed and the

painted wash-hand stand ; but a kiss from
Honor drove away all her fine speeches ;
and with a genuine <sound>exclamation</sound> :

"We could not have loved you better
if you had been a princess !" she flung
herself upon her neck and <sound>wept</sound> <sound>aloud</sound>.

Nor could we have respected you
more had we known all the noble things
that Mr. Langhton has told us of you,"
said Mrs. Warner.

Though how he came to know them,"
began Honor.

Unless Mrs. Osborne told me," interposed
the lawyer, " you cannot guess.
But, indeed," added he, ^^ I have myself
the pleasure of some acquaintance with
your rejected swain, an accomplished person,
who, having a filly to enter for the
Oaks, spelt her name of Psyche without
the P. Some add that by way of making
the rejected letter amends for the omission,
he inserted it where it saw itself for the

first time in the word filly, which according
to his reading stands so — Philly. But
for my part, being of a charitable disposition,
I, like Sir Benjamin Backbite
when talking of Miss Letitia Piper's
Twins, never believe more than half of
these stories''

*^ I wonder," said Mrs. Warner, '^ how
Mrs. Thorpe heard her news."

Oh, the country !" said Stephen, 'the
country accounts for the spread of all
news, false or true. As there are certain
districts to which typhus seems indigenous,
so gossip springs up spontaneously
in the country, it is indeed its natural produce.
This country of yours — this innocent
country !" muttered the old lawyer,
quoting, as he often did, a poignant
figment of Horace Walpole : '' ' Questions
grow there, and the Christian commodity,
neighbours.' In London we don't know
who lives next door. You may bo dead

and buried and nobody know or care ; — a
precious privilege. Now that we are
talking of your grandmother, Honor, tell
me if you have a portrait of her? and
if it be here ? Lady Eossborough
was one of those traditionary beauties
whose loveliness lives in the ears of men,
like that of Cleopatra, or Mary Queen of
Scots, or Lady Coventry."

^^Ah!" exclaimed Katy, " can it be
that enchanting little print of a lady in a
black hat and feathers, which Major De-fancy
was looking at the other night ? the
little engraving which lies between the
leaves of one of the music books ?"

Where my poor brother placed it
just before his fatal illness," said Honor.
'eyes."

''I will show it to you," said Katy.
"Don't disturb it, dear Mr. Langhton,"
added she, in a low voice, '' I think Honor
does not wish it touched. I'll hold it for
mamma and grandmamma."

I have a miniature up-stairs wych
gives a better idea of her beauty," said
Honor.

^^It is hardly possible to go beyond
this," said Mrs. Warner. This is sweetness
itself."

Perhaps sweetness was the best word
for that loveliest face. The rose almost
emitted its fragrance. Charles Fox has
described in his lines to Mrs. Crewe — an
English beauty of whom the Irish countess
was nearly the contemporary — that
surpassing charm, of which the essence is
character. The lines are not poetry, according
to our present notion ; but they
have the merit of making us see the object
described, instead of stopping to admire the
description : —

"Where the sweetest expression to features is joined,
By Nature's most delicate pencil designed ;
Where blushes unbidden, and smiles without art,
Speak the softness and feeling that dwell in the heart ;
Where in manners enchanting no blemish we trace
But the soul keeps the promise we had from the face."

Such was the impression produced by
Reynolds's pencil, and Bartolozzi's graver,
in the portrait of the Countess of Ross-borough.


Still Mr. Langhton wished to see the
miniature. And the whole party, except
Mrs. Warner, followed Honor to the small
room over the door which Mrs. Bell had
assigned to her as a study.

Katy flung her arms round her friend's
waist, as they lightly ascended the stairs,
and whispered :

^^ Did not Major Delancy know Captain
Clive?"

"Yes," was the reply, '^ they were comrades
and friends."

sand your father knew him ?"

"Yes."

And he knew you ?"

"Yes, dear Katy. Ilcre we shall find
the miniature, Mr. Langhton. Yes, here
it is."

"Ah I how lovely!" burst from all
when they saw those features, with the full
magic of colour", sparkling with smiles and
blushes as in life.

And here is her little prayer-book,"
said Honor ; 'rand a few letters to my poor
mother."

'' Let me look at them," interposed Mr.
Langhton; '' I take an interest in everything
belonging to a beauty."

'' They are as sweet as her countenance,"
said Honor. " Ah, and here is some old
point-lace, the lace of which we were talking
the other evening."

'dear me!" ejaculated Mrs. Bell,
giving vent as usual to the unsophisticated
impression. "How ugly ! and what a
colon* ! I beg your pardon, though,"
added she, upon reflection, " I dare say it's
all my fault, and that the lace is really
very handsome."

VOL. I, ' p

Honor smiled, as smile she needs
must.

^^ Dearest Mrs. Bell, your truthfulness is
worth all the fine-lady taste in the world.
I am afraid that, except for the sake of
those to whom it once belonged, I care for
the point-lace as little as you do. There
are my books," added she, addressing the
old gentleman, who was still busy with
the letters of the lovely Countess. " You
can look over 'those at your leisure."

Mrs. Bell had presented Honor with an
old fashioned, very black-looking, little
book-case, which she called a escritoire ; a
combination of desk and shelves, glass
doors above, and three shallow drawers,
with large brass handles, below. Originally
this piece of furniture had decorated the
best parlour ; the shelves having been
filled by a collection of stuffed birds of all
nations, considerably the worse for wear.
Cockatoos were there, and paroquet, and
<sound>humming</sound>-birds no bigger than cock-chases,

reliques bequeathed to some
former generation by a long-deceased
sailor-uncle; and ring-ouzel, white blackbirds,
and other animosities of the same
sort, stuffed by a traditionary aunt
Martha, who had cultivated that singular
female accomplishment.

Mrs, BeU had <sound>sighed</sound> over the dingy and
moth-eaten remains, as she put them into
a comer of the lumber room ; whilst Katy
and Jacob, learned as they were in such
lore, had pored over them as Cuvier over a
new set of fossil bones, guessing at name
and species as a child at a riddle. An old
warped mummy of a home owl had completely
posed them. They took the unlucky
bird for a cat ; and but for the beak which
dropped off in the transit, for a cat it
would have passed to this hour.

Katy had been the chief agent in installing
the new tenants, the books ;
giving her assistance with the most willing

p 2

activity in unpacking, sorting, dusting,
and arranging the several sets. She now
pointed them out to Mr. Langhton, who,
pocketing the Countess's packet, ran his
fingers along the glass as he read the
titles; accompanying the action by a half-muttered
commentary, delivered rather asa
soliloquy, than as a reply to Honor's
apologetic.

^^Yery few, and rather miscellaneous
than select!"

'^ Chaucer, Spencer, Shakespeare, Milton,
— aye, the prose too ; that's right ! —
Dryden, Pope, Cowley, poems and essays,
right there too ! Bacon's Essays, Evelyn,
Pepys, Walton's Lives, Lettres Spirituelles,
Pascal, Holy Living and Dying,
Poster's Essays — the girl's a good girl !
Don Quixote — have you read that, my
queen?"

" No, sir ; and I wish so much to read it.
Will you lend it to me, dear Honor?"

Honor's answer was to take out the
volumes, write Katy's name in the first
page, and give her the work with a tender
kiss.

Mr. Langhton went on with his catalogue
:

Gentle Shepherd, Howell's Letters,
Gandentio di Lucca — curious old book that
of Bishop Berkeley's I she's getting into
my line ! — Burns ; aye, Currie's edition.
"Wonderful creature I — I saw him once.
Eye like an hawk ! What are all these ?
Old ballads ? Yes ; Percy, Scott, Eitson,
Ellis, Thomas Wharton, Andre Cheer
don't know him I Lamb's Specimens ;
good ! Ariosto, Alfieri, Moliere, Madame
de Seine, Defoe's Plague of London,
Vasari, Crabbe, Cowper — my journey', to
wit — Vicar of Wakefield, Franklin's Sophocles.
Did not I see the Greek Antigone
upon his table to-day ? De Gram-mont.
Sully, Drinkwater's Gibraltar —

those would be her brother's books. Miscellaneous
and imperfect as it is, this is
the collection of a woman of a ripe mind,
worth all the beauty in the world!"

Ever since the episode of Don Quixote,
the good lawyer had been literally talking,
or rather muttering to himself; Katy
having drawn Honor away, that they
might look together over the plates in her
beautiful book, for it was that edition
which contains the exquisite '' Dorothea"
of Stothard ; so our friend turned from the
old escritoire, and walked down stairs, in
that which is commonly called a brown
study, and instead of despatching the letter
which he had been writing, took himself
off to London the same afternoon.

CHAPTEE XIII.

THE COPPICE.

That aftemooii was indeed most lovely.
Small fleecy clouds went sailing over the
bright blue sky, casting here and there a
shadow over a landscape almost too bright
in the full sunshine. The leaves — some, as
the elm and the beech, just bursting from
their brown sheaths ; some, like the birch,
waving in tenderest verdure; some, as
the oak, sealed up in the dim buds — formed
a variety enchanting to look upon. Even
where the boughs were bare, they were
alive with sap mounting into the highest

branches, transparent, glowing, full of
purple light.

The orchard of the Farm was one flush
of blossom, every fruit tree garlanded from
the bottom to the top ; whilst over many
a cottage, and at the edge of many a wood,
some noble old pear or wild cheiTy tossed
its white flowers in the sun. Up the downs,
too, came rich glimpses of the golden furze
blossom, thickets of heavy almond odoiu-,
left here and there to shelter the young
lambs.

The park revelled in gorgeous beauty ;
its noble mansion; its masses of evergreens,
cypress, cedar, bay, and pine; its
bright waters, giving back the <sound>weeping</sound>-willow,
the drooping birch, and the huge
Spanish chesnut ; the long lines of American
borders near the house already putting
forth theirs gay colours; the broad
avenue of limes ; the spiral poplars ; and
farther on, the grand old forest trees — oak,

beech, and elm, with their undergrowth of
hawthorn, holly, and fern ; that fern on
which, under the tufted May garlands, does
and fawns lay sleeping in the sun. The
earth, too, was full of fragrance and of
beauty. Everywhere the grass had the deep
verdure of England, now powdered with
daisies, now golden with buttercups, now
enamelled with the purple bells of the
wild hyacinth.

Through this scene of sylvan loveliness,
Katy, with her faithful attendants, Jacob
and Marigold, sallied forth to gather the
first lilies for the Great Farm. Her guardian
had reminded her that she had promised
to fill his jar with that piu'e and
graceful nosegay, composed of some score
or two of delicate stalks, hung with their
snowy bells, and backed-up ^dth the broad
silky leaf, of which the texture is as elegant
as the hue. Honor should have
helped to gather them; but Honor, although

she would never confess to being tired,
often looked pale after one of their long
walks ; and this afternoon, without walking,
she looked paler than ever. So Mrs.
Warner prevailed upon her to stay at
home.

Their way lay across a comer of the
park, to a coppice which ascended in terraces
to the high table-land which overhung
the village. The coppice consisted
almost wholly of hazel, with its fragrant
tassels, interspersed with mountain-ash,
now covered with its broad blossoms, and
oaks of some eighty years' growth. The
ground was literally carpeted with flowers,
wood-sorrel, wood-anemone, wood-vetch,
wood-roof, Solomon-seal, columbine, wild
strawberry, that strange and spectral
flower, the wild Star of Bethlehem, cloud-berries
and lies, in beds of half an acre,
scenting the air.

The path, a steep and winding ascent.

led from terrace to terrace, often undermined
by fox's earths, holes Med up with
dead leaves and living flowers, and looked
upon nothing but the broad tree-tops. The
solitude was unbroken. !Numberless nightingales,
as conscious of the <sound>silence</sound>, seemed
answering each other in that exquisite
variety of song so delicious when profaned
by meaner notes.

The three companions had found in that
pleasant place, and on that lovely May
evening, a congenial occupation.

Jacob, plunged into one of the shallow
pits spoken of above, was driving a long
pole as far as it would go into a hole in the
side, uncertain whether it did or not contain
a litter of rabbits. '^ If that lazy jade
Flora," thought Jacob, ^^ would but have
dragged her fat body this distance, her
tongue would soon have told the truth of
the matter. No rabbit could cheat her.
Into the hole would she have rushed,

scratching and questing. We should have
tracked her inter the ground as old Sam
Powell tracks the moles. To be sure, the
last time she got into a burrow she stuck
fasts and we had to fetch a matter of six
men to dig her out. It cost a good crownpiece
in beer at the Delaney Arms, which
angered Madam Bell. And Miss Katy got
frightened for fear she should be smothered.
So, may be 'tis better she's at home." And
Jacob, a philosopher in his way, pursued
his researches unassisted.

Marigold's diversion was of a different
sort. She had discovered and made prize
of a hedgehog, which, coiling itself into a
ball, exercised a kind of passive resistances
which bade fair to defeat the manoeuvres of
its swift and powerful enemy. Marigold
was puzzled. Xow she gave it a poke with
her pretty black nose, receiving so sharp a
prick on that sensitive part that she tossed
her slender head in the air in consternation.

<sound>ringing</sound> all the bells of her silver collar;
then she gave a quick pat with one foot
then with the other, drawing both feet back
as if they had encountered a red-hot coal.
Then the aggrieved nose was cautiously
inserted underneath the hedgehog, with a
view to find out some more-vulnerable
place, and the hedgehog, thus impelled,
rolled on a little ; then Marigold jumped
first to one side, then to the other, to put
her adversary off his guard (for Marigold
was a greyhound of high race, and
therefore of high courage), and adventured,
much to the damage of her nose,
another poke. At last she lay down with
her head upon her paws, watching her
prey, just as a cat watches a mouse-hole.
"Woe to the hedgehog if, deceived by those
half-closed eyes, he ventures to uncoil
before Marigold leaves her post !

Katy, on her part, was making quick
work with the beautiful lilies as they glimmered

so gracefully between their broad
green leaves; sometimes in large close
beds, sometimes scattered bere and there
amongst the moss and the dead leaves,
with a tuft of fern or of Solomon's seal, ora
stalk of whortleberry intermixed. The
lilies were in their earliest and loveliest
stage, the lower bells fully out, the tops of
the stems crowned with pale green buds,
each larger and paler than the last.

There knelt Katy, filling her great basket;
now listening to the nightingales, now
<sound>singing</sound> snatches of her own sweet <sound>songs</sound>.

^^ Give thee good-morrow, busy bee!"
was her greeting to one of those industrious
insects, as he passed by heavily
laden.

Give thee good even ! would be the
better salutation'' said she ; " for I think
we have both been long enough plundering
the flowers, and may take ourselves
home."

Accordingly she summoned her two
attendants, when her basket was quite, and
she herself almost, overset by a thousand
curvets and gambols played off by Marigold,
in honour of Major Delancy, who had
climbed up one of the steep terraces as
lightly as the four-footed favourite herself,
and now stood by the side of the fair
flower-gatherer.

^^ I have startled you, Miss "Warner; and
Marigold and I have scattered the lilies ;
but I will soon pick them up. And you
must let me carry them. Yes, indeed
you must, I am used to carry flowers.
Happy they who have only known such
burdens."

"Yes," said Katy, "yon are thinking
of the poor soldier, and doubtless his
knapsack — "

Aye," interposed Arthur, " knapsack,
and musket, and kettle, and kit, all
that he has, and all that he has not, in

the roughest weather, and in an enemy's
country. Those are among the sad realities
of life. I am afraid that I was
thinking of burthens less tangible, but
fully as painful — Are you going home ?"
continued he, interrupting himself. ^ ' Shall
we send Jacob back through the fields?
That is the nearest way. And will you
allow me to take his place as your attendant,
and see sou home through the park ?"

Katy felt unusually shy ; but she
said ^^ Yes'' simply because she did not
know how to say No; and for a little
while they walked through the wood in
<sound>silence</sound>, Arthur putting aside the branches
and guiding her into the smoothest ways ;
and, at last, when they had come into
something like a path, winding round the
edge of the coppice, offering her his arm.

" I am walking too fast for you," he
said. " You will be tired."

Katy had often felt — nobody could help

feeling — Arthur Delancy's peculiar sweetness
of manner, his constant consideration
for others, his care for their convenience,
his deference to their feelings, —
in a word the total absence of selfishness.
It was high-breeding, the very highest
breeding ; but it was also somewhat more.
This evening she felt more than ever this
peculiar charm, and yet, instead of putting
her at ease, it had exactly the contrary
effect ; so after saying :

l^Oy indeed, I am not tired ; I am never
tired ; I could walk all day."

She suddenly uttered that which so very
few people, under any temptation, ever do
utter — that is, the exact thought which
arose in her mind, and exclaimed :

^^ Oh ! how I wish that Honor were
here I "

Her companion half started, almost
stopped. He commanded himself, however,
and replied:

VOL, I. Q

I^ for my part, rejoice in her absence.
I wished to see you alone. You are young
and inexperienced, Miss Warner; but
you are also acute and observant ; and I
am sure that you must have observed,
even if my father had not, as he has just
informed me, endeavoured to prepare you
for my proposal, that I was only waiting
for some such opportunity to entreat you
to accept my hand, and share my destiny.' '

It was now Katy's turn to start and
tremble. There are some things for which
all the preparation in the world is of no
avail ; and a proposal of marriage — especially
the first proposal — is one of them.
Her colour went and came ; and if Arthur
had not found her a seat on the stool of a
felled beech, she would probably so far
have disgraced her country breeding as to
have fainted.

He soothed her into composure; and
throwing himself on the ground at her
side, proceeded:

I trust this discomposure is not caused
by aversion ? — '^o ! — Surely you said no !
It is, then, but the modesty which blends
so sweetly with your charming frankness ;
and I may hope that our union, which would
crown the wishes of all my family, and
which is equally agreeable to your own,
may be delayed no longer than the settlements
due to so great an heiress, render
necessary. You come to us, !Miss Warner,
bringing wealth which will redeem the
forfeited estates of our old and honourable
house — which will save the peace, the
health, the very existence of my father;
and yet he feels — we all feel, I most of all
that that wealth fades into nothing
when compared with the loveliness, the
innocence, .the goodness, of its owner.
My father already loves you as a daughter.
My whole life shall be devoted to the endeavour
to render you happy. Will you
not speak a word ? — not one word ?"

Q 2

Poor Katy hung her head in <sound>silence</sound>, and
even turned her blushing cheek aside.

^^ Will you not speak one single word?
Well, then, your flowers shall be your
interpreters. Give me one of the lilies in
your basket, and that answer shall content
me ! "

Gathering herself up almost firmly,
Katy at last found courage to speak :

"I love Lord Delancy dearly; and I
know — no one better — all" your goodness,
Major Delancy; — Oh! far too good — far
too clever for me ! But I must ask one
question. Honor — Were you never engaged
to her ? "

'^ Steer ! on the word of a gentleman ! "
replied Major Delancy, with an open firmness
that it would have been impossible to
disbelieve.

'^ It is very strange," said Katy;
^^ those Spanish songs in your handwriting,
and your never speaking when
you met."

^^ Those songs are of my writing ; sofar
is true, Katy ; and here I might tell
you what is also true, that I was the
bosom friend of her only brother. But
that would only be part of the truth ; and
it is due to you and to myself, to make one
of those confessions most humbling toman's
weakness. Three yea A ago I did
love, or I thought I loved, Honor Clive.
I laid my very heart at her feet, and was
rejected. Since then,, we have never met,
except in your presence. I do not ask,
because I am sure that she has behaved
with the admirable propriety which characterizes
her every word and action, by
keeping my offer secret."

^^ She has never said one word," replied
Katy, much relieved.

^* And this then has been the cause of
your hesitation ? The only cause ? Is there
no happier man ?"

Iso," said Katy stoutly ; "I have never

seen any young men, except Charles and
Harry, and young Mr. Thorpe. And
next to Mr. Langhton and dear Lord
Delancy, I like you. But how can you
think of me after Honor — dear, dear,
Honor?"

It was a strange frankness, and puzzling
to answer. He took her own tone, and told
the truth.

^^ She would have nothing to say to me
Katy. But you — will you not give me one
ofthoseliHes?'^

And with her lilies in his button-hole,
and her hand resting on his arm, the
betrothed couple quitted the coppice.

After a little gentle talk he ventured to
inquire, still very soothingly, for there
was a nervousness about her, rare in that
bright and vigorous spirit:

^^ Since not from any chance expression
of Miss Clive, what could have given you
the suspicion which had like to have
cheated me of two flowers?"

" Oh ! such a different person from
Honors" said Katy, — ^^a gipsy."

^^A gipsy, a fortune-teller ?" enquired
Arthur.

'^ Yes," said she, ^^a gipsy fortune-teller.
It is quite a history. Yesterday morning I
was riding on the downs with Marigold and
Jacob Stokes. We had had a good canter, for
Jacob wasonHonor's pony; and were on the
point of turning back when we came to the
steep ridge that lies on the top of the narrow
valley, called the Soak. You know the
Soak ? Quite full of alders, and willows,
and cotton grass, where the stream oozes
through, with great patches of gorse at the
sides, looking like masses of gold in the
sunshine. So sweet, too ! — oh, so sweet !
Grandmamma says she remembers an old
shepherd, who built himself a hut amongst
the gorse. I don't wonder at it. I should
like to live there myself. Vestiges of the
garden are there still, a gooseberry-bush or

SO, and an old apple-tree; and I suppose there
must be some remains of the cabin, for as
we stood looking down on the Soak we
saw smoke sailing along the hill side, and
two or three children searching for plover's
eggs on the downs."

^^ And these were gipsy children ?"
asked Arthur.

'^ I suppose so," resumed Kate. ^^ As
we were looking at them, a tall woman
appeared close to me, and caught hold of
Britomarte's bridle. Is'ow Britomart^ has
no fancy for tall women, in red cloaks,
who seize her by the bridle, and she soon
shook herself free. But she is the gentlest
creature in the world when once her fright
is over, so after a little prancing she became
<sound>quiet</sound>. And then the gipsy insisted
upon telling my fortune. I had never had
my fortune told, and had no objection ;
only I had no money, and the gipsy declared
that it was essential that her hand

should be crossed with a piece of silver.
Luckily Jacob, who is the handiest boy in
the world, and always has a knife, or a bit
of string, or a hooked stick in his pocket
sin short, whatever one happens to want,
luckily Jacob had sixpence, and that,
and the promise of sending him with
half-a-crown to-day, contented her. So
then — " Here Katy came to a full stop.

^^ What then, dear Katy ? Pray go on,"
said Arthur.

^^ Well, then she took my hand, and
said there was a cross in the line of life ;
that in a very few days — "

'^ Go on, I entreat."

" Some one should say he loved me ; but
that he should really love not me, but
my dearest friend."

*^ Did she say more ?"

IS'o. She was gone as suddenly as
she appeared; and to-day, when Jacob
rode to take her the half-crown, she and
the children had disappeared."

That is strange, indeed," observed the
Major; *^ strangest, perhaps, of all. And
you— ''

^^ I told the whole story to dear ;
and she advised me — sto do —
as I have done, in short'' said poorKaty.
"Was I wrong?"

Never wrong," replied Arthur, very
warmly, " to follow in all things the dictates
of one whose simplicity is the truest
wisdom ! Never wrong to tell all that is
in your own pure heart ! That woman
must have been an emissary of Sir Vivian.
Here is my father. We will not mention
her to him."

Lord Delancy's ecstasy in welcoming
his future daughter-in-law was delightful
to his son. " God grant that T may make
her happy !" was his inward prayer.

CHAPTEE XIV.

THE Lomax STATION.

The intended marriage, although known
by everybody, still passed as officially unannounced.
The ceremony was to be
performed with the strictest privacy, none
but the two families being present, and
the young couple departing at once for a
year's absence on the Continent. A highly
recommended maid, accustomed to foreign
travel, had been engaged by Mrs. Osborne,
and was now at Atherton. Honor's advice
to Mrs. Wilier had been that she only

should accompany the fair bride. She
knew Arthur well, and felt how tenderly
he would be drawn towards the sweet
creature, who would depend upon him for
her slightest action, her hourly amusement,
almost her daily speech. She knew
the charm of intelligent ignorance when
combined with youth and beauty. Here
that ignorance took its most graceful form.
It was clearer every day that theirs was
no love match. The lady (allowing for
her girlish modesty) was too open; the
gentleman too reserved. But daily intercourse
would substitute for the frail
passion, love, the firm but gradual foundations
of habit, esteem, and affection:
no such bad exchange, after all. So
Katy was to go alone.

Lady Lucy, finding that the spouse she
had selected for her niece was devoted to
the turf and the dice box, had repented
her hasty anger, and had written to request

her return. A brother of her father, also,
struck by her spirit, or unwilling that so
near a relative should be known to fill a
dependent situation, had entreated her to
make his house her home. But resisting
both invitations. Honor had promised
Mrs. Warner to remain at the Farm until
Katy should return to Atherton.

Privately as everything was to be conducted,
the preparations for so long an
absence, and the settlement of so large a
property, consumed nearly the whole time
to the day fixed for the payment of the
mortgage; and at last, that very day itself
had come to be chosen for signing the
deeds and performing the marriage ceremony.


Our friend ]mr. Langhton, deeply engaged
in this most important business, and
other affairs connected with the executorship,
had been little seen at Atherton.
Sir Yivian, a bird of ill omen, was known

to be flitting about the neighbourhood,
although his very name was carefully kept
from the noble owner of the hall, just
now furnished with a pleasant excitement
in the presence of Mr. Langhton's favourite,
Mrs. Osborne. To show her the
beauties of the vicinity filled pleasantly
the time of expectation, always lingering,
and never felt to linger so painfully as
when, as in this case, expectation was
mingled with anxiety. Kobddy could tell
why, nobody perhaps would have confessed
to the feeling, but it weighed upon every
mind ; and as the time of suspense shortened
(and it wanted now but three days
to that fixed for the marriage), the weight
pressed more and more heavily; so they
tried the old remedy, and drove about in
hopes of leaving care behind.

One of Katy's greatest charms was her
dark, glossy hair, curling in close rings
like the tendrils of the vine, all round her

neck, that swan-like neck on which her
head was placed so finely.

Before he had called her his queen,
Mr. Langhton, who loved pet names, and
had always petted Katy, used to call her
Miss Wigsby. And really it was difficult
to imagine that such a quantity of bright
curls all grew upon that little head. The
bright hair, the bright eyes, ' the bright
complexion, the bright teeth, the dimples
the smiles, and the elastic figure, becoming
every day more firm and vigorous — all
denoted health as perfect as a woman could
enjoy; but perhaps of all these tokens of
youthful strength, the bright curls were
the most striking.

Mrs. Bell, proud as she well might be
of her beautiful daughter, took especial
delight in all that displayed their shining
luxuriance. Accordingly she had herself
purchased for Katy one of those flapping
broad-leaved Leghorn hats, almost in the

state in which they leave Tuscany, and
brought it to Katy's room this very morning
to be worn on an excursion to an ancient
Eoman encampment, commanding
the extensive and varied views chosen
by the masters of the world for their
walled towns and entrenched stations in
barbarian lands.

The party from the hall was to form
part of the expedition. Mrs. Bell was to
accompany Lady Cardonnel and Mrs.
Osborne in the carriage, whilst the gentlemen
rode on horseback with the younger
ladies.

Little as the two girls, who lived with
each other more as elder sister with
younger than as governess and pupil,
were disposed to differ, this excursion
caused something like a discussion between
them. Katy had taken one of her fancies
that Honor should ride Britomarte. She
wished to see how her two favourites

looked together ; this at least was the
reason she alleged. Perhaps her secret
thought might be a desire to leave the
favourite horse as a parting gift to the
friend who staid behind to comfort her
grand mamma. Of this she said nothing ;
and Honora, asserting her own desire to
ride the good old pony as long as opposition
on a trifling point seemed wise, at
length consented.

Katy, with the new hat, and its long
lutestring ribbons floating on the aii-,
looked more than commonly radiant when
she joined the party at the gate of the
court-yard. Disappointment met her
there in the shape of another pet, or rather
of his absence.

Jacob Stokes, a true country boy, had
not yet arrived at the age in which
country boys delight in finery ; those days
were yet to come. At present his tendencies
lay so inch in a contrary direction,

VOL. I. R

that Katy, whose first thought had been to
procure a new suit for this devoted follower,
found the new suit want renewal
so often, that she had been fain to coax
Mr. Langhton into giving the Atherton
tailor a permanent and unlimited order for
Jacob's apparel. Even this magnificent
provision sometimes failed. Jacob's tastes
were semi aquatic, so that his clothes
were as often wet as diy. Jacob was a
climber, and spent in the air — that is to say,
on the tree-tops after squirrels and birds'
nests — much of the time not passed in the
water, so that his jacket and trousers
were much oftener torn than whole.

On this unlucky day both misfortunes
had befallen the young gentleman. He
had torn his every day jacket and trousers
in the most unseemly manner the night
before, in an encounter with a jagged
branch in his descent from a fir tree;
which tree he had mounted to secure a

pair of ring-doves, intended as a present
for Miss Honor, having preferred the total
min of his raiment and some damage to
his skin to the possible loss of the birds.
Whilst on this very morning an awkward
ducking fi'om a boat on the mere had
soaked his Sunday garments through and
through.

Poor Jacob was an orphan, so that there
were no kind female friends to sew up his
rents, or to dry his wetting. Indeed,
Mrs. Bell, who used to declare that even
Katy's fortune could never stand Jacob's
waste, was one day heard to admit, in a fit
of relenting, '' that to be sure the child had
never known the comfort of a mother to
scold him." So he put on such rags as
did not offend against decency, probably
the pre-legacy suit, and being rather
ashamed to present himself at the Hall
stables — where, being a great favourite with
masters and men, he was usually mounted

on such occasions, — lie made his appearance
on his own old donkey, and happening
to fall in with his unfriend Mrs. Bell, got
sent off so peremptorily that when enquired
after by his young mistress, neither
he nor Marigold could be found.

Mrs. Bell was indignant; she ordered
Joseph to attend her daughter. She harangued
on Jacob's iniquities : '^ In rags,
and on his donkey! — but that boy will
ride anything, all Atherton knows that.
There is nothing with four legs that Jacob
won't ride. Before he was five years old''
continued she, addressing herself now to
an enlarged audience, '^ some show-people
who came to the village with a camel and
a monkey, put him on the camel's hump,
and had well nigh carried him off to take
the place of the monkey, only Dr. Glen-ham
and Joseph set off in pursuit — the
doctor not choosing a Christian child should
be carried off for a monkey !^ He cried to

go with, them then; and some day or
other you'll see that he'll be riding an
elephant !"

Everybody took Jacob's part ; and Major
Delancy promised that some fine morning
she should see him so smart that she would
not know him.

Whilst this took place in one part of the
group, a different dialogue was going on
in another.

" Why are you not riding Britomarte ?
have you quarrelled with her?" said Lord
Delancy to Katy.

'^JS'o," was the reply; '' but Honor "

"Oh, Miss Clive!" interrupted Lord
Delancy, '' she, I suppose, has quarrelled
with the pony !"

Iso, dear Lord Delancy — no, indeed !
I had much ado to make Honor ride Briton
but I wanted to see them together — "
and then she stopped suddenly — " I'll tell
you why another time."

By this time old Joseph had arrived,
pointed on the steady steed that had fora
dozen years drawn Mrs. Bell in her
one-horse chaise to market ; and dressed in
the well-preserved suit in which he had, for
at least as many years, driven his good
mistress on week days, and attended church
on the sabbath; — looking, in short, exactly
like what he was, a most respectable farm
servant, but matching Lord Delancy's carriage,
postilions and grooms, much worse
than Jacob, whether on camel or donkey !
Katy jumped upon her pony; Mrs. Bell
was handed into the carriage ; and the
cavalcade set forth.

The road up to the downs on the opposite
side of the valley to the beautiful
demesne of Lord Delancy — which, begining
in park and gardens, merged into a wild
and wooded chase — was little more thana
cart track. After leaving the village,
with its cornfields and meadows, cultivation

disappeared bit by bit. First came a
bit of woodland, graphically called the
Scrubs," divided from the road by a
stunted hedge, just now gay with the
white blossoms of the wayfaring tree,
giving token of a water course from the
hills ; whilst on the other side of the road,
gay slips of the beautiful sainfoin, now in
full flower, and gayer patches of turnip-seed
in its yellow blossom, ran up between
masses of russet furze, or the short, parched
grass on the steep ascent — forming one
of those contrasts seldom seen without the
aid of man.

The Scrubs edged off into a ragged fir
plantation; many trees looking dead or
half dead, the branches on one side being
altogether sere and bare; and then the
trees ceased altogether in one wild group
of Scotch firs, which flung their giant arms
across the road, crowning the hill with a
boldness worthy of the pencil of Salvator
Rosa.

Tlicy were now fairly on the do^vns.
The whole party paused to look at Atherton,
which lay beneath them as a picture ;
its deep winding road, its bright waters,
its grey church, its orchards,? its cottages,
its farm, and the magnificent park and
mansion, which in spite of all assurance
every one felt to be trembling in the
balance.

Lord Delancy gazed on the view, then
on his son, and on the two young women,
as they sate together near the carriage,
Katy bright as the summer air. Honor
pale and <sound>silent</sound> beside her. A bitterness
which he could not overcome passed across
him as his eye fell upon that pallid face,
and noted how cautiously his son avoided
meeting those gentle looks.

" Now for the view Which I shall show
you," said Katy; " the view which looks
down upon three counties, and sees parts
of more than I can tell. Wc must cross

this ocean of downs, and then descend the
willowy bottom, and then climb up the
Hollow Way, and there we are."

^^ It is not so far as Katy's description
would make you think," said Lady Car-donne
parenthetically to Mrs. Osborne.
^^ The view, seen over an abrupt precipice,
a sheer descent of craggy turf, is, on a
clear day like this, really splendid."

" Why, then, are we waiting ?" asked
Lord Delancy ; adding, with the cold respect
which is so painful to its object, " If
Miss Clive will ride on, the carriage may
follow."

Honor made way instantly ; and then
exerted herself to manage the spirited
creature she rode, and keep pace with the
cavalcade.

The level plain was passed at a canter ;
and they descended, at a somewhat slower
rate, a hill which dipped into a bottom,
where sallow bushes betrayed the presence

of a stream that first trickled across a road
('^The Hollow Way," as Katy called it,)
which seemed hardly wide enough for the
carriage, and crept winding up the lofty
hill that fronted them ; the steepness being
somewhat mitigated by the road sloping
diagonally round the shoulder of the hill
to the top. On the summit was a narrow
table-land, marked by an embankment,
said to be of the time of the Romans, terminated
by the famous view.

They paused for a moment in the little
valley, the postilions rather unwilling to
risk their town-built carriage on so rugged
a road, hoping, perhaps, that the ladies
might prefer walking up the ascent. No
such motion was made. Mrs. Bell was too
well pleased to find herself, for the first
time, in a carriage and four, to dream of
quitting that post of grandeur ; and of the
other two Mrs. Osborne feared the fatigue
for Lady Cardonnel, and Lady Cardonnel

for Mrs. Osborne. So the postilions let the
horses wet their mouths at the brooklet
that crossed the road, and then slowly proceeded
in the wake of the riders.

Katy was wild with glee. The n-esh air
of the hills, always so exhilarating ; the
exercise which she loved so well ; the
beauty of the day ; above all, the manner
in which her two favourites, Honor and
Britomarte, became each other — delighted
her very heart. Her new hat had fallen
back, hanging only by the strings; her
glossy curls were all dishevelled by the
wind ; and she galloped here and there, all
her cares, even the coming wedding, forgotten
; <sound>laughing</sound> and <sound>shouting</sound> with her
sweet, young <sound>voice</sound>, and looking the whilst
so exquisitely pretty that nobody cared to
stop her.

Lord Delancy, who saw that she had
attracted Arthur's attention, was quite
provoked when her mother, in care for

her complexion, and rather scandalized
at her want of decorum, called to her to
put on her hat.

Katy was at the moment when she received
this command rather ahead of
Honora on the lower side of the winding
road ; and, chancing to obey it, gave the
large <sound>flapping</sound> Leghorn hat, with its long
streamers, such a toss right in the eyes of
the high-bred and skittish mare that she
sprang off like a racer, with the Hollow
Way for a course and the precipice for a
goal.

A general <sound>scream</sound> issued fi'om the carriage.


" She is a dead woman," said Lord
Delancy, in a voice so deep and unearthly
that it was heard through all the <sound>shriller</sound>
<sound>exclamations</sound> of the terrified women.

Follow her ! For God's sake stop her !
Will you let her perish before your eyes ?"
cried Lady Cardonnel.

The old servant Joseph, to whom this
was addressed, answered :

'^As to stopping her, my lady, that is
sooner said than done. And as to following,
if any one attempts to follow her,
he signs her death warrant. That mare's
thorough-bred, and the <sound>sound</sound> of another
horse following on the hard road would belike
whip and spur. The poor young
lady has one chance : the hill is the steepest
in the country, and if she can but keep
her heart and her seat — "

"Katy! my Katy I" interrupted Mrs.
Bell, with a mother's piteous <sound>cry</sound>, '^ the
pony's off too !"

And it was indeed obvious that the
pony was following at full, but unequal
speed, the track of the mare. A few
seconds made it also evident that this poor
animal had not run away, but that it was
urged forward by its rider, whose generous
but uncalculating efforts to save her friend

would probably have no other result than
her own destruction.

Joseph, although his own weight, and
the age of his horse, rendered any attempt
to overtake them out of the question,
was so moved by the <sound>cries</sound> of his
mistress, and the danger of her child, that
he galloped forward together with the
grooms to render assistance, if assistance
were possible, or to bring relief from the
terrible uncertainty that prevailed. The
carriage horses were also urged to their
utmost speed ; and for the first time Major
Delancy was missed and enquii-ed for.

At the moment after Britomarte's starting,
he had leaped the bank which divided
the road from the down, and was now
seen pursuing a parallel course higher up
the hill ; evidently intending to gain an
angle from which he might dart on the
terrified steed. It was the only chance of
saving Honora, but the party in the carriage

saw with sinking hearts that it diminished
every moment ; that the strength of the
heavy roadster; and the skill of his rider,
would tell as nothing compared with the
spirit, the fleetness, and the goading fear
of the blood animal on which she was
mounted. The mare gained ground at
every stroke ; Katy still following with
hopeless perseverance ; and Arthur a little
in advance of the pony, but still striving
vainly to get up to Honor.

The road now wound suddenly round
the shoulder of the hill, and one by one
the riders disappeared from the party in the
carriage, whose fear became more intense
as the uncertainty increased and the precipice
neared.

jVIi's. Bell in spite of all dissuasion continued
mechanically to <sound>scream</sound>, "My
Katy ! my child ! my child ! my Katy !"
Lady Cardonnel was in <sound>gasping</sound>, <sound>sobbing</sound>,
choking hysterics ; and Mrs. Osborne

(il'o^\^lC(l in tears. But the person who
probably felt most was he who neither
<sound>wept</sound>, nor sighed, nor screamed, the stem
and proud Lord Delancy, whose last
glance at that gentle creature had been a
glance of hatred, whose last word a word
of scorn.

Moments seemed ages in that agony of
fear, and yet all dreaded its termination.
They urged the drivers forward as if they
had dared to hope, and yet they all knew
that humanly speaking hope there was none.

Suddenly a <sound>loud</sound> discordant <sound>shout</sound> was
heard coming round the side of the hill,
and fear for a moment seemed lost in
certainty. All felt that it proceeded from
Joseph's horror at witnessing the fatal
plunge.

This conclusion passed through every
mind, and Katy seemed now the only
care ; when suddenly as they were wheeling
round the steep ascent, Joseph himself

was seen advancing waving this hat and
<sound>shouting</sound> with the <sound>voice</sound> of a stentor that
all was well.

A few minutes more brought them to
their intended destination — the Eoman
camp — where they found the whole of the
actors in the scene as safe as Joseph had
asserted, and reinforced by two never
characters in the shape of Marigold, and
Jacob Stokes on his beloved donkey'.

When they anived, old Joseph had just
lifted Honora from her saddle and placed
her on the grass, where she sat,
very pale, trembling, and <sound>silent</sound>. Major
Delancy, equally <sound>silent</sound> and equally
pale, was holding the pony. Jacob, still
seated on his donkey, kept a tight grip of
Britomarte, whilst Katy stood leaning over
lier dear governess, alternately <sound>laughing</sound>?
and <sound>crying</sound> ; now kissing the pale cheeks
of her friend, now shaking hands with
Jacob Stokes ; praising him, defending

VOL. I. s

Britomarte, and accusing herself all in a
breath. Mrs. Bell seized on Katy for the
double purpose of hugging and scolding,
and the rest of the party showered question
after question upon the truant boy
and Major Delancy. Prom his short
breathless answers and the more detailed
account of Katy's squire, it appeared that
that faithful adherent, finding himself excluded
from the expedition, and thinking,
as he expressed it, that his young lady might
want him, had set off by a nearer bridle
road to the place of destination, where he
lay perdu behind the bank. When Briton
approached, he and Marigold started
up so suddenly before her eyes, that their
appearance and his <sound>shout</sound> of alarm had
the effect of turning that sensitive animal
from her dangerous path, and caused her sofar
to slacken her speed, that in clambering
over the steep bank that bordered the
road on the safer side. Miss Olive's own

ATHERTON. 259

efforts had stopped her. Jacob, no mean
judge, volunteered high praise of the young
lady's courage and horsemanship :

'miss Katy could not have sate the
mare better."

Katy had been taken care of by her
betrothed bridegroom. Too late to stop
the first runaway, he had probably saved
the life of the second, whose over-urged
pony had reached the very brink of the crag
without power to check its speed, and now
stood quivering in every limb with the
sense of escaped danger.

The whole party, leaving the mother and
daughter to their natural transports, had
now gathered round Miss Clive, who sate, as
in a trance, making no reply to Lady Car-donne'
s congratulations, and neither returning
nor seeming to notice the affectionate
caresses of Mrs. Osborne. She remained
seemingly unconscious of all that was

s2

passing round her until Lord Delancy
asked in a broken voice :

*^ Are you hurt, Honora ?"

The name and the accent seemed to
thrill through her frame. She shivered ;
looked up with one of her sweet smiles,
said, ^^^0, 1 am quite well !" and sank back
in a fainting fit upon the turf.

It is hardly necessary to add that none
of them looked at the famous prospect
they had come to visit.

CHAPTEE XY.

TEilPTATIOX.

Whilst these events were proceeding
at the old Eoman Station, the Eectory was
the scene of a somewhat unexpected visitation.


It had happened this morning that the
good doctor had received a proof of the
'" Trades," which, printed at the University
Press, and submitted to a learned
friend in one of the colleges, was enriched
with annotations and queries, which however
profitable to the future correctness of
the edition, had, for the moment, the effect

of driving the excellent editor well nigh
crazy ! Questions which seemed settled
were thrown open ; doubts which had
been smoothed down into certainties were
resolved into their old unsatisfactory form ;
and a universal note of interrogation seemed
spread over the new readings, which were
to convince every scholar, from Cambridge
to Gottingen. Dear Dr. Glenham felt, as
many a dabbler in print has felt before
him, that the pen of a critical friend is a
sharp weapon.

When the packet arrived he was in the
act of dressing; and, stopping the operation
of the toilet to look over the proof,
ran down, just as he was, to his library, to
examine various editions, and muster up
authorities for the use of a disputed monosyllable,
which seemed to him a question of
life and death.

Now the doctor adhered rigidly to his
old, clerical costume of black stockings

and knee breeches ; and having forgotten
to leave off the gauze stockings which he
wore in the winter (without editing a play
of Euripides, one may contrive sometimes
to forget that it is summer in. our climate),
and being in the act of donning his silken
hose, he still presented the somewhat anomalous
appearance of one black leg and
one white one, when several hours afterwards,
Sir Yivian Delancy was ushered
into his library.

At no point of his editorial labours had
that den of disorder assumed such an
appearance of confusion as now. Books
covered the tables ; books littered the
chairs; books strewed the floor. The room
looked as untidy as the master — who, besides
the odd legs, had one knee-buckle
unfastened, no studs in either wristbands,
which straggled forth from his grey ,
and no cravat round his neck —
and this at foi* o'clock of a fine summer
day!

Host and visitor were taken aback; this,
however, could not last long. Dr. Glen-ham,
always a gentleman, recovered at
once from this learned abstraction, and
from the shame of being caught in it ; and
Sir Yivian, a man of the world-smith a
point to gain, took care to see as little of
the disorder as might be : he even, whilst
the rector was clearing a seat for him,
contrived to intimate his admiration of
the rare scholarship evinced by the books
amidst which he stood, and to express
something like envy of the learned abstraction,
of which the result would bethe
enlightenment of the world in general,
and of the universities in particular.

The doctor, now completely aroused,
kept his own counsel as to the manner in
which his labours had been called to account
by one of the most eminent luminaries
of those universities ; and, waiving
his guest's compliments with something

like a deprecatory smile, requested to know
in what ho could be of use to him ?

You hardly seem to remember me,
Dr. Glenham," said the guest ; *' yet,
smell, you were Eector of Atherton when
I returned from India, longer ago than I
like to remember."

Yes," replied the doctor, ^^ I was so,
but yoiu- ^dsit was, I think, a short one ;
and I was much engaged at Cambridge,
not having chosen to resign my college
tutorship, imtil the examination of my
pupils had taken place, — two of them
were wranglers of the year. We must,
however, have met ; and it does not need
a personal acquaintance to inspire me with
a deep interest in the welfare of any of
the family of Delancy."

Sir Yivian bowed as accepting the compliment,
and the good doctor continued —

I owe to Lord Delancy the home
where m^ days have passed easily, happily,

aud not, I trust, without benefit to
my flock. He lias much contributed by
his society and his co-operation to my
personal enjoyment, and my pastoral usefulness;
whilst to his son Arthur I am
bound by all those associations which link
the old to the young. I have patted his
head as a child, and have lived to see him
fulfilling the promise of his boyhood, as a
brave and honourable man. Next to my
own household I love the Delancy's ; and I
confess. Sir Vivian, that the sight of you
in this house is very pleasant to me, since
I cannot but hope, that even now, at the
eleventh hour, you have done me the
honour to select me as the bearer of friendly
overtures to persons who are, after all, your
nearest kinsmen. I know that there is in
the very incidents of a lawsuit (which is,
after all, a sort of warfare) — an element
which, Awhile it pushes on to conquest,
serves also to embitter the combatants.

But when once the battle is won, it is
in the nature of all men — especially, as
we are apt to believe of all Englishmen — to
forgive and forget — a process much easier,
by the way, to the victor than to the vanquished.
If you come to me as a peacemaker,
I shall most readily accept the
office."

Dr. Glenham spoke in perfect good faith.
Lord Delancy, too proud a man to make
unnecessary confidences, had never alluded
to the private wrongs which had envenomed
the one great wound; and the simple
scholar, ignorant of the desperate state of
his noble friend's affairs, hoped and believed
that the sore might yet be healed
by a few concessions on either side, and

that Sir Yivian had fixed upon him as

«
the mediator.

'' First, let me ask, my good sir, whether
you happen to know how matters
stand betwixt us ?" inquired his guest.

No other way," replied the Doctor,
" than as all men who read the papers
know of the great will cause. One of those
causes terrible to the contending parties, in
which, wherever the abstract right may lie,
there is on either side such a show of reason
and such a chance of success that
lawyers may honestly urge on their clients
from term to term, from year to year, from
lustre to lustre, until the expenses of the
loser may even exceed the value of the original
object of contention. In such a case
it behoves the rich man who succeeds to
consider the state of the poor kinsman who
loses, and — "

^^ Why, there it is," interrupted Sir
Vivian. '^ There is the crying injustice !
They, the losers and their friends, talk
of the great law-suit as the cause of their
ruin, utterly forgetting the reckless extravagance
of generation upon generation,
builders of mansions, collectors of pio-hires,

furnishers of libraries, wasters and
spendthrifts in every shape ; and then —
]N'ay, hear me out, good doctor; — then,
Avhen the first and only man of their race,
who for two centuries has known how to
make money and how to keep it, steps into
preserve the old property in the old
name, he is visited with as much reproach
and reprobation as if, in lending his own
money, he had committed a highways robbery',
or as if demanding it back were a
murder."

I am to understand then, Sir Vivian*'
said the Eector, "that the report which
announced you as the real holder of the
large mortgages on your kinsman's property
is true ? And if you have indeed advanced
the money with the view of retaining
the old estates in the old name, and
making Major Delancy your heir in fact,
as he is in law, I for one, shall hear of such
a pui-pose with unmingled pleasure and
admiration."

Sir Yivian answered the part of this
speech which suited him, leaving the conclusion
unnoticed.

" Yes, I hold mortgages over the entire
property ; and if not redeemed by twelve
o'clock at noon on the day after tomorrow,
notice of foreclosure having been duly
given, the estates and manors of Atherton
and Delancy, with all their royalties and
dependencies, become absolutely mine. It
was not, however, of this. Dr. Glenham,
that I came to speak. They tell me that
you are excellent as a parish priest, — the
friend as well as the pastor of your flock ;
and I come to make appeal to you in that
character, in behalf of the widow and the
orphan — not such as require the common
succour that riches can give ; but those to
whom riches has proved a peril far greater
than poverty ; the simple-minded parents
who are about to fling the richest heiress
in England, herself almost a child, into the
arms of a landless and penniless soldier."

ATHERTON. 271

^^ Be very sure, Sir Yivian," said the
Doctor, " that the whole circumstances of
the estate are known to them all. Mrs.
Warner declared to me herself, that the
son of her old landlord, one whom she had
known from his earliest childhood, was in
her eye preferable to the son of the richest
Duke in England. Katy will have enough
for both."

A man ten years her senior !"
Pshaw ! my good sir ! — a man of six-and-twenty
and a girl of sixteen are contemporaries.
Katy, to be sure, is full
young. But these great heir's are somewhat
in the position of princes, and are
affianced and wedded at an earlier age than
common mortals. Poor things ! it is a
part of their destiny to lose the joyous
privilege of girlhood, the happy years
that come between the restraints of the
child and the cares of the matron. But
the yoimg couple are going abroad, where,

without any set form of instruction, so ]
quick and docile a girl as Katy will insensibly
acquire all that is wanting to fit her j
for the station she will have to fill. 'No i
man is more accomplished than Major De-fancy,
or more calculated to train a clever i
uneducated girl into a cultivated wife.
She is most fortunate in having fallen into |
such hands."

" You think so?" said Sir Vivian, with a J
very peculiar expression. Then drawing ;
his chair close to his host he continued ina
low voice and with fi-frequent pauses : — !

*^ Have you seen, Dr. Glenham, a young j
woman, b}" name Honora Clive, who now |
fills the post of governess to Miss Warner ?
Yes ? You know her then ? Did you
ever hear, that three years ago, that young
lady was known as the daughter of Colonel i
Clive, and of his wife Lady Honora, daughter
of the famous beauty, the Countess of \
Eossborough, and connected with half the

noble families in Ireland ? Xo ? You did
not know this ? Well, this young lady,
whose father and brother were then alive,
was the object of an idolatrous passion on
the part of Arthur Delancy. You look
mistrustfully. Ask Lady Cardonnel ; ask,
if you will, Major Delancy or Miss Clive.
The' were quartered together at Valenciennes
during the time the allied armies
occupied France. The brother and the
lover were bosom friends."

'^Do you mean to say that they were
betrothed '?" enquired Dr. Glenham.

'' Of that I know nothing. What I do
know is that three years ago he was
madly in love. The father and brother
were living then ; now they are dead ; and
she is here a poor governess, the hired
governess of his destined bride."

^^ A strange tale !" exclaimed the Eector,
in spite of himself much startled.

'' A true tale !'' said the visitor, "on that

VOL. I. T

I "will pledge my life. Make the best
you can of it, and you mil find the
poor girl deserted and the rich one
married. You know Miss Clive, you
say. I have never seen her; but I
have heard and I can well believe that the
elegant and cultivated woman still maintains
her influence ; that the red and
white of Katy's cheek is valueless in her
suitor's eyes, compared with the grace,
the talent, the composed sweetness of her
rival. Think you yourself what chance of
domestic felicity may be found in an
alliance beginning with a preference for
another. Hearken, Dr. Glenham, these
women are, as it were, flung upon your
protection. It becomes your character and
youi- office to acquaint Mrs. Warner with
what you have heard ; to caution her that
the future happiness, aye, and the future
conduct and reputation of a girl so yoimg,
so beautiful, and so unguarded as her granddaughter,

may be wrecked in this union.
There is no man whose position renders him
so fit to give this warning. There is no one,"
added he, in a still lower voice, '^ so interested
in the warning being heeded.
Tell her to make her granddaughter at
once a ward in Chancery; and then, if three
years hence, the fine and spirited lad,
her old playmate, who did not wait for
her riches to lay his heart at her feet,
should be objected to for want of wealth,
I promise to settle upon him all this
estate of Atherton, with its goodly farms
and manors, its waters and its woodlands,
its chases and its downs — aye, and the advowson
to boot, which would be a provision
for his brother. Break off this marriage —
only break off this marriage — and rely on
me for more than I have promised." And
without waiting for an answer Sir Vivian
departed.

And what said our good Doctor, as

T 2

still with one white log and one black,
he sank back into his seat ?

Tempter !" cried he, ^^ tempter !"
It is one of the safeguards of the
simple, good folk of this world, that the
cunning wicked ones seldom give them
credit for real goodness. They think, for
the most part, that everybody is marketable,
and that any resistance they may
happen to meet with will yield to a higher
bidding ; and so they lose the benefit of
much previous caution by a too open avowal
of their ulterior purpose.

Had Sir Yivian contented himself with
the impression which he had really made,
by stating that which was actually true
of Major Delancy and Miss Clive, and
garnishing that truth with his own false
inferences, he would so far have carried
his point as to have sent the Doctor full of
alarm to caution 'Mrs. Warner. The allusion
to Harry, and the bribe of the

bequest of Atherton, showed at once that
either a revenge was his object, for which
no price could be too high; or that, as
seemed most probable, ho feared that the
long coveted property should be snatched
from his grasp at the last moment, redeemed
by Eichard Strange's hoards.

I will go to her," thought the Doctor,
" to warn her against this man's machinations,
I'll go to her at once'' resolved he,
magnanimously, throwing aside the Greek
commentator which had stolen into his
hand; 'rand then I'll come back and put
up the proof. After all I was a fool to
vex myself about my good friend's criticisms.
He is an able man, a very able
man ; but he has not given himself to this
play for six months as I have done. So I
shall stick to my own readings, and desire
the printer to send the other sheets
straight to me."

A wise resolution, which, to the honour
of both these worthies, caused no coolness
on either side.

CHAPTEE Xii.

Relenting.

"When Dr. Glenham reached the Great
Farm, he found its excellent mistress just
recovering from the emotion which she
had undergone, in hearing of the danger
of the two girls, who might be said to
divide her heart between them: Honor's
sweetness had fairly captivated Mrs.
Warner.

Think if we had lost her ! " exclaimed
the old lady, ^^ Katy would have died too ;
for, first and last, her giddiness was the
cause of the danger. She would insist on

Honor's riding the mare. Then she flirted
her great hat right in front of that skittish
creature's eyes. And then, poor thing,
she set off as hard as the pony could lay
legs to the ground, to follow the runaway,
thus causing her to redouble her speed.
"We never can be thankful enough to that
little lad, Jacob Stokes, who is always in
the way when he is wanted, and was certainly,
under Providence, the saving of
dear Honor; as Major Delaney, by his
great presence of mind and admirable
horsemanship, was the rescuer of Katy.
What a blessing it is to think that that
dear child will have such a protector
through the trials of life."

*^I am exactly of your opinion, Mrs.
"Warner," said the Doctor ; '' but I have
just had a visitor whose object was to
inspire both of us with very different
feelings."

And then, being alone with the good

lady — Mrs. Bell having insisted on the
young ladies' lying down, and being
engaged in narrating the escape, and
dilating upon Jacob's merits to everybody
who would listen to her — he related the
whole conversation.

'' May Heaven forgive him ! " said she.
'^ He must be as old as I am, and yet he
thinks of nothing but money and revenge.
The money he must leave behind him,
as poor Eichard Strange has done. But
revenge — that is a grievous load to carry
with him to the grave, and beyond the
grave ! May God tui'n his heart, for He
alone can I As to this matter, dear Dr.
Glenham, it is certain that Arthur Delancy
did propose to Honor, three years ago,
and that she refused him. He told Katy
so himself, and that accounts for a sort of
shyness which has always existed between
them ; men seldom pardon a rejection of
that sort. It always oversets Honor to

think of the days when she lived with her
father and her brother Lionel. You know
that she gave her little portion to purchase
Captain Olive's commission, and to pay
his debts. He seems to have been one of
those charming persons (not very prudent)
for whom wives, and sisters, and mothers,
often do sacrifice their all. Then her
father's death left her homeless, and she
lived with an aunt, who was a matchmaker.
But Honor did not like matchmaking
; so she came here : a blessing
wherever she goes I I should miss her
almost as much as Katy."

The next morning brought Mr. Osborne
and the marriage settlements, but no Mr.
Langhton. His partner, however, assured
Lord Delancy that he might rely on seeing
him with the money by ten o'clock the
succeeding forenoon, wh en the deeds were
to be signed, and the money at once
paid to Sir Yivian, to whom and to whose

solicitor formal notice to that effect had
been given. This was driving matters
fearfully close ; but Mr. Langhton had
never yet failed, Mr. Osborne asserted, ina
business appointment, and would certainly
not begin his shortcomings with a
client whom he so much respected, a friend
whom he so much loved. The reason
assigned for the delay was the receipt of
a large sum of the Strange effects, which
was to be paid late that evening. He was
also to bring a special license.

Accordingly, the gentlemen were closeted
all the morning, reading over the settlements
at their absent friend's request.
Lord Delancy's composure surprised his
son; who, indeed, showed more anxiety on
his account than he did.

The ladies had agreed to take an early
dinner at the Hall, and spend the afternoon
in fishing on the mere. But only Mrs.
Bell and her daughter arrived. ^Lrs.

"Warner had been a little shaken by the
after-shock of yesterday's alarm, and
Honor stayed to take care of her.

Between six and seven these two friends
were seated together in an arbour, where
lilac and acacia, the wandering clematis,
and the tasselled lime gave fragrance the
whole summer through. At this moment,
however, a profusion of honeysuckles, straggling
and twisting amongst them all, shed
their unrivalled perfume upon the air,
beginning to emit their delicious odours
just as the sun declines and the dew rises.
In front of the arbour a broad turf walk
led to the house, bordered on either side
by a row of pinks, alternately white and
red, backed up by clumps of white rocket,
double July-flowers and fraxinella, and
these again by moss-roses, white lilies,
and sweet peas. Behind them nicely
trained espaliers formed a verdant wall,
concealing a kitchen garden, which, if

it had existed in our days, would have
carried off half the prizes in the country.
That kitchen garden was the pride of old
Joseph's heart.

He, however, was away in the hay-field.
It was his little grandson Jacob, who had
just deposited upon the tea-table, at which
Honor was officiating, a plate of strawberries,
real hautbois, which he declared
could not be matched at the Hall. They
came from Miss Katy's own garden, and
he had been sent from the lake on purpose
to gather them for her grand mamma and
Miss Honor. "MissKaty," Jacob said, shad
had a great mind to come herself ; but the
Major had been answerable for his choosing
the best, and said he might be trusted.
He liked the Major. Should he say the
strawberries were good ?"

excellent! Jacob. Grandmamma's
kindest love," said Honor.

Jacob turned to go, and at the side of
the path stood Lord Delancy.

^^ There is no mischief, dear Mrs.
"Warner? No accident," said he, giving
Jacob a kind parting tap. " I am not a
herald of ill fortune. But, having been
engaged all the morning with important
papers, and unable to get here, I could not
satisfy myself without ascertaining in
person that you have not suffered from the
agitation of hearing of our late sad adventure,
and that she whose danger caused
us all so much alarm has recovered the
physical ill effects of such peril. We saw
yesterday, that, perfect as was her self-command
in the hour of struggle, her
strength gave way when the demand for
it had passed."

"Oh, my lord !" said Honor, " do not
speak so kindly, or I shall give way again.
There are some voices whose sympathy
goes straight to the heart. Your goodness
would overset me quite."

Well, you and Mrs. Warner must give

me some tea," replied lie cheerfully, as
Eaehel and her followers appeared in the
walk with the bright copper tea-kettle and
the whole apparatus ; ^^ and then, A^ith her
leave, we will have a little talk."

Nowhere is the meal so dear to woman,
the English tea eaten in such perfection,
as at an old-fashioned farm-house. The
thick, fresh cream, the newly-churned
butter, the home-baked bread, the homemade
cakes, and the female ministry, in
the sweet evening air, perfumed with
flowers and with the passage of heavy
waggons loaded with hay — all made it a
feast of country luxuries ; yet, even with
the addition of Katy's strawberries, the
meal passed away almost untasted.

nearly at the same moment with her
serving-maidens, Mrs. Warner retired to
the house ; making a pretext of putting in
water a white rose, in which she had found
the earliest golden beetle of the year.

Katy loved to look at those glittering
green wings, and then to return the pretty
insect unharmed to its tree.

" You stay there, my dear," was her
parting injunction. So, very <sound>calm</sound> and very
pale, Honor stayed.

Paler and less calm, Lord Delancy stood
before her.

" I come to you, a culprit. Miss Clive;
nay ; hear me out, dear Honor ! I know
that you disuse none of these confessions,
but it is a comfort to me to pour them
forth. When, between five and six years
ago, my son, then a very young man, made
acquaintance with your accomplished brother,
one of the most promising officers
in the service, I was delighted to promote
in every way I could, an intimacy
which so thoroughly commanded my approbation.
They visited me together at
Delancy Castle, and at my house in town ;
and I travelled with them in Switzerland,

Germany, and Italy ; never separating, in
short, until the war which terminated at
Waterloo recalled the young men to their
respective regiments, whilst I myself returned
to England almost as much attached
to Lionel Clive as to my own Arthur. Little
did either divine that a few short months
would cause me to repent that intimacy ;
that the chance which threw my son into
the same town with Lionel's father and
sister — already predisposed to be his Mends,
from the friendship which united him with
their son and brother — should change all my
feelings towards the family. But already,
although I dared not own it even to myself,
I felt — I knew, that the fatal suit on
which all our fortunes were staked was
virtually lost ; and that, in marrying a
girl of high family and small portion,
Arthur was insuring misery to himself and
to her. I found all my fears verified when
I heard from Lady Cardonnel that, for the

VOL. I. V

first time in his life, he loved a woman
worthy of him in every sense of the word.
I told her (what indeed she already
guessed) how matters stood with me; and
her next letter brought the unexpected
tidings that Arthur had sought your hand
and had been rejected. When my son
returned to England this subject was never
mentioned. Then came successive blows
upon your house and mine ; the death of
poor Lionel, followed so rapidly by that of
Colonel Clive ; the loss of this law-suit, and
the discovery of the real mortgagee. In
these miserable money anxieties every
generous feeling seems to die ; and this
passage of Arthur's life was forgotten like a
dream ; until, most unexpectedly, I found
Miss Clive in the governess of the young
girl — the very sweet young girl (let
me do her no injustice !) whom circumstances
had induced me to select as my
future daughter-in-law. The name, the

christian name, the face and voice so
like poor Lionel, and, more than all, the
averted looks of Arthur, convinced me
that I saw indeed the Honor Clive whom
he had so loved."

Here Honor broke in — " Stay ; now, my
lord, hear me, and believe me, I conjure
you, when I say that, strange as it seems, I
never heard the name of Atherton in conjunction
with yours; nor ever, till we
were at the gates of this house, heard
Lord Delancy mentioned as the landlord of
Mrs. Warner. Then, Mr. Langhton can tell
you ho w earnestly I entreated him to return. ' '

^^He has told me so," said Lord Delancy.
'^ I know that you were ignorant of the
connexion."

' Without confessing all that had passed, ' '
continued she, '^ I felt that I could not
convey to Mr. Langhton the strong motives
that prompted my desire to return. I
submitted therefore to enter the family,

V 2

and to incur the risk of a suspicion, which
I rejoice to find is now swept away from
your lordship's mind. And, indeed, except
the grief of seeing my dear brother's
friends so cold to his poor sister (and that
is over now), what harm has been done ?
Major Delancy, except in one generous
expression of regret to see me in a dependant
situation, has never breathed a word
which could imply a recollection of our
former acquaintance ; and when tomorrow
he carries away as his bride that
sweetest child of all the earth, fresh and
pure as one of her own roses, he will not,
I think, find her the worse for the six
months that we have spent together in
sisterly love."

Honor !" said Lord Delancy, " I come
to say to you that I repent not only of my
sins towards you (those, I see, that you have
forgiven), but of my deep wrongs towards
Arthur and towards myself. I have been

carried away by many passions, all of
them evil, — by pride, by hatred, by an
inordinate love of station and position, and
an inordinate worship of my own family.
Partly, too, I have been led astray by sins
that hide themselves in fairer names, — by a
devotion to art as it lives in splendid mansions,
and in great collections, — ^by a love
of science and of learning, as seen in great
libraries, — of fine scenery as shown in drest
gardens : as if beauty were not as general
as the blue sky and the green earth ! — as
if the best books were not also the commonest
! — as if home were not as dear in
the cottage as in the palace ! The one thing,
Honor, that cannot be supplied is love. It
is my firm belief that Arthur's affections
are still yours ; and I come to you to lay
his fate and mine at your feet. Let this
mercenary marriage be broken off. Let
us go forth poor and happy. There will still
bo something left. The Commander-in*

Chief knew and prized your father — knows
and prizes Arthur. I shall not be too
proud to share a soldier's home ; and if I
have seemed proud and stem to you,
Honor, only consent to be my daughter,
and you shall find how well your father
will pay his long debt of love."

Honor leaned her head on her hands.
Perhaps lie prayed for power to resist
what was, indeed, a sore temptation. If
so, her prayer was granted. She looked
up with gentle composure.

*^ My dear lord," she said, ^^ I thank
you from the bottom of my heart, for a
goodness and a confidence which will be a
comfort to me as long as I live. But this
which you propose must not be. These
dear and excellent women who have behaved
so nobly and so trustingly must not
be abandoned. Strong, indeed, must have
been your determination to sacrifice your
own wishes and your own interests to the

fancied wishes of your son, when it caused
you to forget that your honour and his are
pledged to Katy, and to those who have
influenced her in this engagement. Be
assured that Major Delancy would not
allow such a sacrifice. Be certain also,
that no happiness could follow an union so
brought about. He will find, as we all
find, that the only true felicity is in the
path of duty. He and that sweetest girl
will depart to-mon-ow for the Continent —
she looking to him for every act and word.
Think how that will endear her to one so
kind and generous as Arthur ! As forme,
I shall only have too many homes !
Mrs. Warner, Mrs. Osborne, Lady Car-donne,
Mr. Langhton, my own relations,
are all earnest in invitations ; and your lordship
will see, before many years are passed,
that I shall be amongst your own guests
at Atherton, with no other feeling on any
side than that of the sincerest friendship's

CHAPTEE Evil

A WEDDING MORNING.

The next morning there was not a
cloud in the sky, hardly a breeze to wave
the uncut grass in the upland pastures i
never was dawn so lovely as that which
ushered in the wedding-day of the heir of
Atherton and his blooming bride.

It had need be pregnant with good
omens, that busy morning, when, be the
marriage private as it may, so much of
the outward and the frivolous is mingled
strangely and jarringly with the deepest
emotions, with trembling hope and lurking

fear. Ah, those orange-blossoms !
those Brussels veils I how often have they
overhung tearful eyes and pallid cheeks!
Taken at the very best, say that affection
have presided over the union, let friends
consent and fortune smile — even then
what a wrench it is from old habits, old
homes, and old affections. That bridegroom
had need be very dear for whose
sake the beloved resigns the companions
of her whole maiden life, the familiar
household names, the every-day sights
and sounds, the thousand cherished associations,
of which the full charm is never
felt till they are lost.

With Katy it was a more than ordinary
plunge. She left not only the dear
home of which she had been the delight,
but the safe and happy station in which
she had been reared ; — that station too
low for pride, too affluent for want, full
of healthy occupation, and exempt from

all restraint except that of womanly propriety,
wliicli is perhaps amongst the most
blessed upon earth. She was to return to
Atherton, hut she left for ever the Great
Farm. Poor Katy !

It seemed as if until that morning she
had never fully realized her position. She
hung round her mother's neck ; she clung
to her grand mother's knees; she poured
forth floods of tears on Honor's bosom. It
is quite certain that she hugged old
Eachel, Flora, Marigold, Britomarte, and
the pony ; it is not quite certain that she
did not hug Jacob Stokes.

The first drop of consolation came from
that young gentleman :

'' Never mind me, Miss Katy ! Don't
take leave of me, I'm going too," cried
Jacob. '^ Don't you see how fine I am ?
I'm to be your page, or whatever you
choose to make of me, and Britomarte and
Marigold are to follow with the Major's

horses. That was settled last night in the
boat. The Major asked me how you liked
your new maid, and whether I thought
you had a fancy for any more of your old
people. Bless you, Miss Katy, you may
carry away half Atherton if you like. He
and the old Lord think of nothing but
making you happy — just look at my
jacket?"

Katy turned him round and round;
admired the silver filligree buttons ;
thought how kind it was to take with
her the things she had been used to at
home ; wiped away her tears, and was comforted.


Mr. Langhton's non-arrival the night
before had rendered it necessary (as has
been said elsewhere) to transact on that
very wedding morning the formal official
business of the redemption of the title-deeds.
He had written in the clearest
manner to Lord Delancy that he should arrive

at ten o'clock ; that the settlements
should then be signed, the money paid, and
the young couple married. The Delancy
Arms was the spot fixed upon for redeeming
the securities, and none who knew
Mr. Langhton could allow themselves to
doubt of his being there in time*

Accordingly the party from the Hall,
and Dr. Glenham, met at nine o'clock at
the farm, the bridegroom bringing no other
present to the flower-loving girl than a
nosegay of such as she loved best. They
suited well her delicate dress; and the
beauty which, enhanced by sensibility,
seemed more Winning than ever.

Mr. Osborne had brought with hint the
unsigned settlements, which lay on a table
at one end of the old stone hall, where the
breakfast was set out, and the company
assembled. They proceeded to discuss the
viands, partly, as the lawyer observed, to
save time, partly to beguile by any sort of

occupation the hour that would probably
elapse before the arrival of the guardian,
without whose presence all these preparations
would be vain.

The breakfast was <sound>silent</sound> and sad. A
doubt, for which they would have found it
difficult to account, had crept upon most
of the party.

Mr. Osborne, who would have gone to
the stake upon his partner's good faith, and
who was besides better acquainted than
the rest with the cause of his absence, began
to count up the possible impediments
to his return.

His wife even more reliant upon Stephen,
and quite ignorant of the eventualities
which alarmed her husband, began
seriously to suspect that Sir Vivian
(of whom she had pretty much the notion
that a child has of some bad genius in an
Eastern Tale) might have waylaid and
murdered their admirable friend.

Dr. Glenham, remembering his recent
visit, thought he had found some more
supple agent, innkeeper or postilion, to
drive the good lawyer in a wrong direction,
or to overturn the chaise.

Lady Cardonnel, accustomed to her 's
ill fortune, thought that some
new stroke of fate had interposed to prevent
the clearance of his property.

The mother and grandmother, now that
the trying moment approached, thought
only of the grief of parting, and rejoiced
in every delay.

Major Delancy looked at the two girls
as they sate in <sound>silence</sound> side by side, and
hand in hand, and felt that the sacrifice
must be made, and would probably be
made in vain.

His father was calm. It seemed as if
his anxiety was only for his son ; and that
the rescue of his ancestral property from
his treacherous kinsman had become a secondary
object.

Ten o'clock <sound>struck</sound>. It was heard first from
a pretty French time-piece, on the mantelpiece,
a present from Lady Cardonnel ; then
from the old house clock in the kitchen ;
then from the church tower ; then from
the great turret clock at the Hall.

*^ These country clocks are never right'
said Mr. Osborne ; ^^ I set my watch yesterday
by the Horse Guards."

On consulting that watch it told the
same tale ; so did the watches of the other
gentlemen ; so did the old sundial which
Honor ran to examine.

It seemed as if the charm of Mr. Langton's
punctuality* was broken. He had
fixed a certain hour ; that hour was passed,
and he had not arrived. Nobody blamed
him. They who loved the good lawyer,
which included everybody present, began,
some <sound>loudly</sound> and some silently, to entertain
the most unreasonable fears for his safety.

Can Sir Vivian have petitioned the

Chancellor to make Katy a ward of the
coui't?'' enquired Dr. Glenham of Mr.
Osborne.

^^The Chancellor is cognizant of the
matter," was the reply.

^^Has any one heard of Sir Yivian today
or yesterday ?" asked Major Delancy.

" I saw him with two other gentlemen at
the Delancy Arms, as I came up the village,"
said the Eector.

Time crept on. The minute hand advanced
upon the clock ; the shadow traversed
the old sundial; and eleven was
heard <sound>tinkling</sound> from the little French timepiece,
<sound>jangling</sound> <sound>loudly</sound> from the kitchen, and
<sound>pealing</sound> in deep tones, softened by distance,
from the church tower and the Hall.

The suspense now became intolerable.
Again, for the twentieth time, Mr. Osborne
walked into the court to look or listen
for the expected carriage.

" Don't you think," enquired Dr. Glen-ham,

when he returned again unsuccessful
; " does not it seem to you better
that the settlements should be signed?
Mr. Langhton will then have only to
glance at the signatures, and carry the
money at once to the mortgagee.

A momentary pause ensued, agitated
and agitating. The lawyer made no
reply.

'' Surely it will be best'* said Lady
Cardonnel. ^^ Arthur ! Katy!"

Major Delancy advanced to lead his
fair bride to the table, but all on a sudden
Katy escaped from his hands, and flung
herself at her grandmother's feet.

^^ Grandmamma ! dear grand mamma !
Major Delancy does not love me ! How
should he, poor ignorant child that I am ?
He does not love me, and he does love
dear Honor. He does not say so. He
will not say so. But I know it. I feel
it. Aye'' said she, in a lower voice, '^ and

VOL I. X

Honor loves him. I always thought so, I
don't know why; and perhaps I ought not
to say such a thing. Eut I am sure of it.
Only see how she is crying at this moment.
And look at him. And look at dear Lord
Delancy. They love each other, and it has
been that thought which has kept me from
the feeling which would otherwise have made
me so unhappy now. Listen ! Grandmamma.
One half of this money will pay ojQP these
mortgages. Let dear Honor have it as if
she were really my sister ; and let her
marry Major Delancy ; and let me stay
with mamma and you. I shall be as
happy as the day is long, when Honor is
happy too ; and let her live at the Hall,
and come and see us every day. What
could we do without Honor ? How could
we be happy if we made her miserable ?
Let Arthur and Honor have this money,
dear grand mamma ! "

Oh ! that I could, my Katy ! " said

Mrs. Warner, her venerable head shaking
more than ever. ^^Biit you are a minor.
my child, and till you are of age we can
do nothing."

" Ah ! " said Katy, " I am sure Mr.
Langhton can manage it ; and here he is,
thank Heaven ! "

X 2

CHAPTEE XVIII.

SIGNING THE SETTLEMENTS.

Oh ! Mr. Langhton, you are come just intime,"
continued Katy, whose impetuosity
kad borne down all interruption, flying to
meet him, and clinging to his arm.

" Quite in time," replied he, smiling,
and flinging down a great blue bag heavy
with parchments. " These arc the title-deeds,
and you are free."

'' But listen to me, Mr. Langhton,"
persisted Katy. '' Honor must have half
of this money — more than half, three parts.
Now listen'' said she, almost in a whisper,

'^ Major Delancy does not want to marry
me, indeed he does not; and I do not
want to marry him or anybody ; I am too
young. Let me live with mamma and
grand mamma here in my dear old home,
and give her the money, and make everybody
happy ; now, do ! "

'* Stop a moment Katy ; nobody shall
many you against your will, my queen,"
said Mr. Langhton. '• Bo content, Mrs.
"Warner, all will go well ; only let me tell
my good lord here that he is his own man
again; every estate freed; galleries, collections,
libraries, all : he has but one
creditor, and she will not be a hard one''

'^ But, dear Langton'' said Lord De-fancy,
^^you cannot imagine, even if it
were possible, that we are capable of
taking advantage of this sweet child's
proposal; I answer for my son as for
myself; aye, and I answer for another;
Honor would not let us if we were so

f

l)use.'- His son aiiJ. Honor pressed each
u hand.

'shave patience for an instant," said
our friend Stephen. " Of course, Osborne,
you guessed that I was detained in crossing
fi'oni Dublin. We had head-winds
all the way. I promise you I had a race
for it. However, I brought down half-a
dozen undeniable witnesses; had half-an-hour
to spare by the clock and by the sun ;
and the thing is settled for ever by their
own admission."

One word in this speech in spite of
its peculiar interest had arrested general
attention, and strom Dublin!" <sound>burst</sound>
from several <sound>voices</sound>.

Yes, from Dublin," resumed the
lawyer. " You have left the name
blank in the settlement as I told
you ?" said he to his partner. ^^ Yes,
I see you have. Well, now, good folk,
sit down, and I will satisfy your

curiosity. Sit down, everybody. And
you, Honor, be pleased to listen. Do you
remember a little old prayer-book wbieb
had belonged to your grandmother, Lady
Eossborough, the famous beauty, and some
letters of her writing, which I craved
permission to read? Well, that little prayer-book
had on the fly-leaf a name and a date
written in yellow faded ink, the maiden
name, as you told me, of your grandmother,
the second wife of your grandfather,
the Earl of Eossborough. stow it so
happened that I had been searching after
this very name for five or six months ;
searching, I think, all over England,
amongst churchyards and parish registers,
and registers of all sorts, except just the
Peerage, sow, I recognised at a glance
the handwriting of that inscription, and
the initials of the donor ; also, I recognised
the character of the packet of old letters.
I said nothing to you then, because there

were still a good many points to verify
and make clear, not only to my own
satisfaction, but to that of certain sages
learned in the law ; amongst the rest to
the Lord High Chancellor. Early this
morning all was settled. I took care to
have Sir Vivian's money ready before.
And when I tell you, my dear lord, and
you, Mrs. Warner, that the name was
Elizabeth Brown of Weston, near Southampton
; that the letters were in her
character ; and that the words on the fly-leaf
were in the handwriting of Eichard
Strange; in short, that our fair friend
Honora Clive is the only surviving child
of her only daughter, and the actual heir
to the moiety of the assets of the said
Eichard Strange ; the missing legatee for
whom I have been seeking ; — why I think
you will admit that my precaution of
leaving the name blank in the settlements
was by no means superfluous."

The conclusion, not so logical as the
usual deductions of our clear-headed friend,
was received in almost total <sound>silence</sound>. The
good lawyer tapped his snuff-box, drew
himself up, and muttered, half unconsciously,
the words of Prosper : —

• So glad of this as they I cannot be ;

But ray content

At nothing can be more.' "

He finished by kissing Honor s forehead,
who hid her blushing face upon his
shoulder.

Mrs. Warner, more moved by joy than
by the distress in which she had borne so
true a part, folded her hands in mute
thankfulness. Mrs. Bell cried out triumphantly
:

'•^ I knew it ! I was sure of it! I was
always certain that Honor would turnout
to belong to us somehow or other."

Whilst Katy, <sound>laughing</sound>, <sound>crying</sound>, and
<sound>singing</sound> in a <sound>breath</sound>, skipped round the

room iu an ecstacy, and finally flung her-see
into Mr. Langhton's arms.

Those most concerned, however, father
and son, seemed spell-bound. Lady Car-donne
came to their relief.

'^ Tell us, Mr. Langhton, how came it
that the tough, withered heart of this
miser, the modem Midas, who turned all
he touched into gold, was softened even
by the matchless beauty of Lady Eoss-
borough ? Where did he meet with her ?
I have heard my own Irish godfather
boast of her as turning every head in
Dublin fifty years ago. But he always
claimed her as a countrywoman ; an L.'ish
Browne."

'^JS'o, Englishmen replied Stephen. "It
is the one bit of poetry in a miser's life,
inasmuch as true passion is always poetry.
Looking over the securities left by
Eichai'd Strange, I found, just after the
discovery of the prayer-book, a note

almost written over by accounts, which
explained some of the facts of the story,
and guided me to the locality. Lady
Eossborough, then Elizabeth Brown,
lived with her father, a half-pay lieutenant,
in the pretty hamlet of Weston,
on the Southampton Theater, catching
the <sound>breath</sound> of the salt sea, as your old
sailor loves to do. Eichard Strange, then
about five-and-thirty, went there after a
long illness for health and cheapness. He
had already laid the foundation of his
fortune ; and offered settlements to his fair
enslaver which might have tempted a
richer maiden. She refused his hand, but
that his heart remained with her this
legacy sufficiently proves. And now,
Honor, tell me, did I do well in applying
a part of yom' money to pay off Sii-
Yivian ? I never in my life saw a man
so unwilling to receive a bundle of bank-bills.
Was I wrong, I say?"
"Oh,Mr. Langton"

'because, if I were, the estates can
still be charged with the sum. It is nota
bad investment."

"Oh, Mr. Langhton !" said Honor;
dear, dear friend, you are breaking my
heart. Lord Delancy, it was only last
night that you offered — that you wished
Even if Major Delancy should still resent
what passed three years ago, you
surely will not disdain to think of me as
poor Lionel's sister ; as one to whom this
money can bring no pleasure, no comfort
in the world, unless you will condescend
to use it?"

^^My daughter! my dear, dear daughter
!'' said Lord Delancy, folding her in
his arms ; " we cannot take the money
without a far more precious gift."

*' But he has not said he loves me,"
faintly whispered the heiress.

^^Honoral my own Honora! ray first
and only love!" exclaimed Arthur. And

Lord Delancy, with, a fervent blessing,
placed her trembling hand within his
son's ; nor even in that moment of ecstacy
was Katy forgotten.

swell," said Mr. Langhton half-an-hour
after, when the name of Honora
Clive had been inserted in the blanks
left in the settlement, and that important
document, duly signed and witnessed, had
been safely consigned to the keeping of the
blue bag, 'well, it is some comfort to think
that so excellent a specimen of engrossing
will not be thrown away. I hate to see
good sheep-skin wasted. And there was
some danger here, I promise you ; for as
Honor refused to marry Major Delancy
when she was poor, and he hesitated at
marrying her because she became rich,
and Katy would have nothing to say to
him at any rate, a marriage settlement
seemed as sheer a superfluity as the money

which Sii' Vivian brought down to pay
the bell-ringers and treat the parish on
taking possession of Atherton Hall. We'll
ring the bells next week to another guess
tune. And half a dozen years hence we'll
have another bell-<sound>ringing</sound> and another
wedding-day. Yes, my queen! you may
make sure of that ; for if nobody else will
have you, I'll marry you myself. In the
meanwhile you shall stay here at Atherton,
according to your desire, with the
dear mamma and the dear grand mamma ;
coddling all the old women in the village,
nursing all the children, riding Briton
stuffing Flora, and spoiling everybody,
especially Marigold and Jacob
Stokes."

DOLLY AND HEE BEAUX.

Several years ago, I spent some montis
with a near and dear relation, whom I shall
call General Vernon, and his no less charming
wife, the Lady Anne at their fine
place in the North of England. They had
a large and lovely family of boys, from
18 years old to 8, some at Eton, some
at a military school, and one already in

VOL. II. B



the army : and of girls from 15 downwards,
all at home ; the elder ones under
the care of an accomplished governess,
and the youngest, a fairy of 
(three-and-sixpence, as her father
used to say, when the little lass's age came
under discussion), who not yet subjected
to the discipline of the school-room, and
quite weary of the large, dull, deserted
nursery, and the good old family nurse,
Mrs. Hicks (I believe she had brought up
three generations of the Vernon's), a tun
of a woman, who sate in state in a great
easy arm chair, grumbling over her corns
and her rheumatism, — used to escape as
often as possible to the gayer parts of
the mansion ; a privileged and most welcome
intruder, whose merry voice might
be heard <sound>singing</sound> through hall and gallery
the moment you entered the door, and
found indeed an almost infallible guide as
to which part of the house, the library

for instance, or the drawing-room, happened
to be that in which the greater part
of the family was assembled. Wherever
most people were assembled and most fun
going forward ; wherever, in short, there
was most <sound>noise</sound>, there, heightening, redoubling
and provoking the <sound>din</sound>, was, you
may be sure, Miss Dolly.

Dolly, whose real name, by the way,
was Dora, though it is doubtful whether
she had been so addressed since the christening;
the very maids — even Mrs. Hicks
herself, calling her Miss Dolly. Dolly
was a nice little girl : small of her age,
but well formed and active, with abundance
of flaxen ringlets, blue eyes, and a
pink and white complexion, not much unlike
her own great wax doll, and not very
much larger, the chief difference between
them consisting in the absence of <sound>noise</sound> and
motion on the doll's part, wherein Dolly
had the advantage, and in the far superior

neatness of the waxen lady's apparel : neither
Mrs. Hicks, nor her aide-de-camp;
Patty (the nursery maid) being able to
keep Dolly tidy, though they tried hard,
after their several fashions, to achieve that
most laudable object. Mrs. Hicks hoping,
<sound>lamenting</sound>, and <sound>sighing</sound> in her great chair,
over torn frocks and tattered trowsers ;
whilst Patty chased her young mistress,
needle in hand, running up tucks, sewing
on strings, and tying sashes ; all of which
might truly be called labour in vain, for
Dolly was a romp at heart, a romp in grain,
and it would be as easy to wash a blackamoor
white as to preserve cleanliness and
order in the person of a young lady who
labours under that unlucky propensity.

Dolly (I am sorry to give so bad a character
to my heroine) was a most inveterate
romp. She romped with her brothers
and sisters wherever she met with them ;
with her father and mother whenever she

could coax them into the sport ; with Miss
Harris, the governess ; with Patty, the
nursery maid ; and, finally, notwithstanding
corns and the rheumatism, with Mrs.
Hicks herself, who, in spite of a considerable
degree of gravity, mental and bodily,
and a decided theoretical objection to such
rudeness, could not always find in her
heart to resist Dolly's practical temptation,
especially when Dolly climbed to the top of
her great chair, and stole the very spectacles
from off her nose.

This was the signal for a game of play,
which used to last till poor fat Mrs. Hicks,
tired as ever a poor fat Mrs. Hicks was
before, was forced to give in and <sound>cry</sound> for
quarter : and then Dolly (who seldom
attacked Mrs. Hicks until she had exhausted
the patience of her other biped
play fellows) used to resort to the quadrupeds
of the house — her mamma's lapdog,
her papa's poodle, her sister's kitten,

Miss Harris's cat, and a much enduring
terrier of her own, called Tiny, for amusement
and consolation ; and they, especially
Tiny and the kitten, would enter into her
glee, and jump and frisk about, and scratch
and tear the clothes upon her back, and
make such a commotion as would have
wearied anybody under the sun except
Dolly ; but Dolly was untenable. It was
perfectly wonderful how much fatigue,
under the name of play, that little person
could endure — from sunrise to sundown
she was in perpetual motion. Miss Harris
(who dreaded her coming into the schoolroom)
used to declare that it made her
head ache only to look at her !

Besides being a romp, Dolly (the sins
are apt to go together in damsels inter
four years old) was, I am sorry to say, a
most desperate flirt. She had early made
the discovery that gentlemen, who have
no bonnets to discompose, nor gowns to

rumple, make far better play-fellows than
ladies who have their millinery and petticoats
to take care of, and are, besides, less
strong in the arm, and therefore less capable
of giving, what Dolly liked better than
anything, a good high toss. Gentlemen
were, therefore, her decided favourites ;
and every male visitor, who came to the
house, was sure of being challenged to a
game of romps with Miss Dolly. But,
besides these chance beaux, she had, nearly
from the time she could talk, a regular
flirtation on hand with some favourite of
the house.

First on the list was Mr. Simon Bates,
the house steward ; a retainer of the family
of somewhere about Mrs. Hicks' standing,
for whom in his youth he had been suspected
of a lurking penchant, and for ^vhom
he still retained sufficient partiality to induce
him to pay her long and frequent
visits in the nursery, when his flirtation

with Miss Dolly commenced. It did not
last long. Poor Mr. Simon Bates, besides
being nearly as unwieldy as Mrs. Hicks,
was subject to fits of the gout, which
utterly incapacitated him from the active
gambols that his young lady required, so
he relinquished his post, or she turned
him off (either version may serve) as
speedily as possible.

His successor was Mr. Jackson the
butler, whose pantry, abutting on the
great stairs, threw him frequently in
Dolly's way, and enabled him to give her
two exercises of which she was exceedingly
fond — sliding down the banisters,
and trotting round the hall on horseback,
Mr. Jackson performing the part of a steed,
and prancing and curvetting on hands and
feet for her gratification. What added to
her pleasure in this sport was Jackson's
being furnished with a natural bridle, in
the shape of a pig-tail, he being of the old-fashioned

race of butlers, with a red face
blazing amidst his frizzed and powdered
hair — silk stockings, paste buckles, and,
on state occasions, an embroidered waistcoat
with long flaps, which some former
head of the Demons had worn at court. A
capital steed, Dolly, in her lisping English,
was pleased to call him " very niche
hurtle ;" but, notwithstanding his alacrity
in moving on all-fours, poor Mr. Jackson's
red nose was fated to be put out of joint
even sooner than that of his predecessor,
Mr. Bates.

The favourite by whom the galloping
butler was superseded, was a certain
Eugene Prince, or, as his comrades called
him. Prince Eugene, who accompanied
Harry Yemen home from the Military
College, one Christmas holidays. Prince
Eugene was exactly the person to worry a
young lady off her feet ; bold, active,
lively, and good humoured, and blest with

such h fund of animal spirits that he could
even tire down Dolly herself. Prince
Eugene was irresistible; he tossed her
over his head, he shook her into penny
pieces, he called her his little wife, he <sound>sang</sound>
<sound>songs</sound>, made faces, and played Punch for
her amusement ; and reigned without a
rival, whether on four feet or on two.
Eut, alas ! the Christmas hours do not last
for ever. Prince Eugene departed, and
poor Dolly was left a disconsolate damsel,
to seek another play-fellow as best she
might.

She found, or rather made one, in the
shape of the vicar of the parish ; a grave,
decorous, respectable, Mr. Samian, who
at first sight seemed an unpromising subject
for a romping bout. But the gentleman
had more fun in him than he seemed
to have; and being much at the house, and
amused by the manner in which Dolly
forced herself upon his attention, and insisted

on his tossing her up to the ceiling,
and shaking her into penny pieces, and
calling her his little Tvife, like her "poor
dear Print," he took very greatly to
the office, and, on my arrival at General
Vernon's, I found him as regularly romping
with Dolly after dinner, as saying
grace before.

This state of things did not last long ;
Dolly was, as I have said, a flirt as well
as a romp; and an occasion soon presented
itself for displaying her unlucky quality
in full perfection. It came, as usual, in
the form of a rival.

The time of my visit happened to be on
the eve of a general election ; and a few
days after my arrival, a fellow guest made
his appearance in the shape of a young
baronet, who was a candidate for the
representation of the next town, where the
Demons had great interest. A very agreeable
person was Sir Eobert, — cheerful.

pliant, and good humoured, and so over-owing
with civility, that he made his
court to every creature in the house, from
Lady Ann, the really lovely eldest daughter,
do^Ti to Finette and Tiny. Of course
Dolly was not overlooked. He out-tossed
and out-shook Mr. Harman ; made more
faces and <sound>sang</sound> more <sound>songs</sound> than Prince
Eugene ; played Punch twice over ; galloped
on all fours three times round the
great drawing-room ; declared that she
should be nobody's wife but his; and
finally, promised to carry her away with
him the next morning.

The night had been stormy, and Mr.
Harman had, as was frequently the casein
bad weather, slept at the great house ;
and the morning being brilliantly fine,
we were all assembled to witness the
departure of the two gentlemen — the one
on foot to the vicarage, the other on
horseback to the independent borough of

G , when, to our great astonishment,

Dolly marched into the hall, equipped
in her best pelisse and bonnet, with a
huge wax doll in one hand, and a coach
and four with their outriders (the gift of
Mr. Harman,) in the other. ^^Thtop ! "
shouted Dolly, perceiving that her new
admirer, who was already mounted, was
bowing himself off as fast as possible,
'' thtop ! I go too ! "

'^Xo," rejoined the faithless swain,
"not now, dear Dolly; there's no room;
you see I'm on horseback : I'll come back
in a carriage and fetch you and your doll.
I'll come back for you tomorrow,
Dolly."

I go now,^^ screamed Dolly. " I ride
before — I ride behind. I or wife ! "
quoth Dolly. But all in vain, for her
treacherous admirer nodded, and kissed
his hand, and galloped off; he <sound>laughed</sound>
and he rode away, and poor Dolly, quite

astounded at anybody's being as fickle as
herself, seemed likely to cry, till, catching
a glimpse of Mr. Harman, who was
now, in his turn, taking leave, she resumed
her doll and her coach-and-four,
which she had put down in her consternation,
and then said very <sound>quietly</sound>, —
Well, then, Mither Harman, I go with

00."

^^No," rejoined Mr. Harman, ^^not
to-day, Miss Dolly. I'll come and fetch
you another time ; " and off he bowed
himself; and poor Dolly, quite astounded
with this great moral lesson on the
dangers of flirtation, and the treachery of
men, walked back to the nursery quite
misanthropic, exclaiming, with the dullest
possible union of mirth, of observation,
and falseness of grammar, '^ Month with
all alike ! " she being, perhaps, the first
young lady of three years and a half old,
who ever had occasion, on her own account

to verify the words of the old
song,—

Sigh no more, ladies, ladies, sigh no more, —

Men were deceivers ever ;
One foot on sea and one on shore,

To one thing constant never."

"Month with all alike," quoth poor
Dolly, and off she marched to play with
Tin.

A HIGHLAND STORY.

This jealousy
for a precious creature." — Shakspeare.

A MORE inquisitive race of dogs than the
greyhound, breathes not upon this earth.
Wanting the sense of smell which usually
leads astray those four-footed people, who,
like the best of the two-footed generation,
have certain small and genial frailties
mingled amongst their many virtues —
lacking that temptation to step aside from
the straight and beaten path, they indulge

their wandering propensities by poking
their pretty noses into every crevice and
cranny they can spy out, and following
every indication of life or motion which
their quick sense of seeing and hearing
can detect on every side.

Many a dance has my lamented Mayflower
led me, by her vagaries in this way ;
and, as greyhound nature will be greyhound
nature under all varieties of coat or
feature, I suspect that the fair Marion
Campbell found her pet Luath — rough,
wiry, bony, though he was, and of the
sturdier and stronger sex — quite as unmanageable
as I did my fair, sleek, delicate
canine companion; although, in addition
to all other points of difference, the good
greyhound Mayflower happened to be a
lady, and we all know that '^ the menfolk,"
as a country friend of mine is pleased
disparagingly to designate that important
part of the creation, are pleased to anon

gate to themselves a total deficiency in the
great quality of curiosity.

I do not see that we '^ women-folk "
have any business to quarrel with this
assertion. If they who go clad in doublet
and hose choose to make over to the
wearers of bodice and petticoat the exclusive
possession of the great faculty,
which may be called the very key to
knowledge, I can find no reason why we
should disclaim a distinction so honourable
; except, indeed, the trifling consideration
called truth, may count for anything
in the argument; in which case, I should
feel myself bound to declare, that, according
to my limited observation, the quality
in question is about as equally divided
between the sexes, as freely and bountifully
scattered amongst all animals bethany
pretensions to intelligence, whether
biped or quadruped, as any — what shall
we call it ? — any questionable virtue well
can be.

That this same organ of inquisitiveness
was as strongly developed in Marion
Campbell's rough and faithful attendant,
as in my delicate pet, was made unpleasantly
conscious to his fair mistress during
a ramble which she, accompanied only by
Luath and her damsel Janet, (whose functions
about the daughter of the old Highland
chief much resembled those of a
modem lady's-maid,) was taking through
her native glens, one fine morning in
August.

Marion passed along in <sound>silence</sound> ; wrapt,
sooth to say — as, in the heyday of her
bloom, woman, from the princess to the
peasant, is wont — in ^^ maiden meditations''
which, in the presence at least, and,
as I suspect, in a good many others, was,
with all submission to the great poet, anything
but ^^ fancy free."

Marion Campbell's meditations glanced
over her mind, mingling and crossing, now

c 2

bright and now gloomy, like the tartan of
her house, to which, indeed, that checkered
and many-coloured web, a young lady's
musings, may not unaptly be likened.

First she thought of a new sacque and
petticoat of pale lilac damask, flowered
with alternate bouquets of roses and carnations,
the most magnificent habiliment
that had ever penetrated north of Inverary ;
and of a Mechlin head and ruffles, brought
her in a present by her kinsman Archibald
— Cousin Archie, as she used to call
him, when they were children together —
now a captain in Kingston's dragoons;
then she repeated to herself certain rhymes
of the ingenious Mr. Moore, (upon that
thin diet did the lovers of poetry banquet
in those days,) whose '' Fables for the
Female Sex," published a year or two before,
had just found their way into the
Highlands; then the form of a heather
sprig suggested an apron that she was

flowering to wear with the above-mentioned
damask suit ; then she thought of
her poor friend Helen Cameron, sister of
the chief of Dungallan, whose] proficiency
in the mysteries of the needle had been
acquired in a French convent, and who
had taken so much pains to accomplish her
in the gentle science of tent-stitch and
cross-stitch ; then the horrors of civil war,
the much that she had heard, and the
little that she had seen, of the last year's
miseries, (for the ramble of which we are
speaking occurred in the '46,) came shudderingly
over her mind, as a cloud passes
across the sun.

'^ Poor, poor Helen ! " thought Marion,
<sound>sighing</sound> ; " Archibald used to be jealous
of Dungallan. He had little cause. Heaven
knows. I never thought of him, except as
the brother of my Mend, whatever might
be his wishes with regard to me; and
now, if, indeed, he be still alive, he is

chased like the hill fox or the hare, and
has nowhere to lay his head. Poor Dun-gallant
! poor, poor Helen ! Oh, the sickening
horror of such a war as this has
been ! — kinsman with kinsman, friend with
Mend. And now this fearful search after
a vanquished enemy ! — this hunting down
an old acquaintance, or, it may be, an
honourable rival, like a beast of the
field ! Oh, to a brave spirit, it must be
misery ! " sighed Marion to herself, imputing,
as a tender woman so often does
impute, her own feelings to the man whom
she loves. " Archibald must feel it so, in
spite of his devotion to General Campbell
(who has been as a father to him,) and his
loyalty to King George. And now these
fearful sentences ! — that poor young girl
who died of a broken heart at the execution
of her lover !* They wring one's very

; " a story so touching, that even the false taste of
the versifier has failed to spoil it.

soul. But Archibald has leave of absence
now, for the cure of that old wound at
Culloden, and will remain with us during
the whole autumn ; and no fugitive would
be mad enough to come into the Campbell's
country. Then, in the winter, my
father talks of taking me to Edinburgh."
And the lilac damask, with alternate bouquets
of roses and carnations, flitted before
the eyes of the fair wearer. ^^ ]Neo one
knows what may happen in the winter ! "
thought she ; and visions of snow-white
satin night-gowns, and white and silver
brocades, the bridal paraphernalia of the
time, gleamed, for an instant, in her
mind's eye, calling forth a blush and a
smile, a look and a feeling of innocent
hope, which banished for the moment, the
recollection that such things as war and
misery had ever existed in this world of
sunshine and shadow.

These were the musings which the

pranks and vagaries of Lnatli had. interrupted.


First he was aware of the motion of a
moor-fowl among the heather, and he
darted np the hill side with the speed of
an arrow, giving to his fair lady, and still
more to her serving maiden — who exerted
her lungs most manfully for his recovery,
<sound>screaming</sound> at the top of a naturally
high <sound>voice</sound> until the rocks <sound>echoed</sound> back the
<sound>sound</sound> as if it had been the <sound>shriek</sound> of a
mountain eagle — giving to his fair
pursuers the exceedingly tormenting
and provoking spectacle of moving
away the faster the more he was
called back. Then a deer shewed himself
in the valley, and off he darted through
the glen, with a rush that threatened to
run down the whole herd ; while Janet's
<sound>shrill</sound> pipe <sound>resounded</sound> through the uttermost
depths of the glen, as it had before
climbed the topmost ridge of the crags.

Then he contented himself with slighter
deviations from the straight path, skipped
from right to left, and from left to right,
poking his nose into that nook and this
cranny, until, at last, just as the bridal
apparition had crossed Marion's fancy, he
disappeared behind a small clump of brushwood
— two or three young birch trees,
and a plant or two of yellow broom and
Scotch brier that grew on the ledge of a
cliff, down which, in winter, a mountain
torrent made its way, and vanished bodily,
or seemed to vanish, into the face of the
rock.

The extraordinary disappearance of her
favourite — followed as it was, first by a
low <sound>sound</sound> from Luath, something between
a bark and a <sound>growl</sound>, then by one or two
muttered words, the speaker continuing
invisible, and a slight <sound>noise</sound> of struggling
effectually aroused his fair mistress ;
who, naturally high-spirited, free-born, and

vigorous in mind and body, as becomes a
mountain maid, plunged, without hesitation,
into the stony bed of the torrent, now
completely dried up by the summer sun ;
and, scrambling with considerable difficulty,
(for the loose stones gave way even
under her • light tread, and she was forced
to grasp every instant at the tufts of
grass and heather that grew in the fissures
of the cliff, and hung over its sides, to
keep herself from falling,) succeeded, after
some minutes' hard climbing, in gaining
the position which her pet had reached at
half a dozen bounds, and found herself
perched upon a narrow ledge of rock overhanging
the water-course, at about twenty
feet from the bottom of the precipice ;
hardly wide enough to afford room to the
little tuft of brushwood above which the
cliff rose in a smooth, sheer ascent, until
it seemed mingling with the clouds.

Behind this small clump of birch, and

broom, and briar, and now quite concealed
by the summer foliage, was a small fissure,
penetrating the natural mound, through
which it was clear that Luath had disappeared,
and into which she also passed,
regardless alike of the dangers that she
might encounter there, and of the warnings
of Janet, who, climbing and remonstrating
with equal good will, followed her lady as
rapidly as a hearty tumble, which had
unluckily befallen her at the commencement
of her ascent, would permit.

A similar misadventure had very nearly
occurred to her fair mistress, not aware, at
the moment of her entrance, of the rapid
shelving of the naiTow passage into the
cave in which it terminated. She recovered
herself, however, and found, by
the light which penetrated through the
fissure, (the only light which the place
afforded,) that she was in a natural cavern,
of considerable extent, and immediately

confronted by a young man, \7lio stood
directly opposite to her, with, an air and
attitude of calm determination, one hand
vigorously planted upon Luath's neck, and
the other grasping a pistol which he had
drawn from his belt.

Both were instantly relaxed as he perceived
the sex of the intruder.

^^ A woman!" exclaimed he, replacing
the pistol in his girdle, whilst Luath, in a
transport of pleasure, sprang upon Marion's
shoulder, and nestled his rough head
against her cheek. ^^ A lady ! then I have
nothing to fear." And, with a courtesy
which seemed habitual, he dragged a block
of smooth stone, the only thing resembling
a seat which the cave afforded, to a level
spot near his fair visitor, and entreated
her to take possession of it, in an accent
whose gentle cheerfulness contrasted singularly
with his rude and squalid aspect.

Marion, complying with his request,

gazed upon him, as he stood before her,
with a mixture of wonder and compassion.
He was a tall young man, of a fair complexion,
or rather a complexion which,
before a long exposure to sun, and wind,
and weather, had been fair ; and a countenance
which, in spite of a tremendous
length of beard, had something at once
singular and agreeable. He wore an old
dark tartan coat, a plaid, and a philibeg,
with a pistol and a dirk at his side. His
garments were torn and dirty, his feet all
but bare, and his whole appearance indicated
the extremity of human privation.


'^ One of those unhappy sufferers ! "
thought Marion, as her bright eyes filled
with tears. "So might my father and
my poor cousin Archibald " — even in her
silent thoughts, she did not call him by a
tenderer name — ^^ so might they have
wandered in their enemy's country, and

have hidden in caves and rocks, had the
day of Culloden ended differently''

"It is only my maid, sir — one for
whose discretion I can answer," said
Marion, aloud, as the entrance of Janet,
and her <sound>exclamation</sound> of alarm and astonishment
at sight of the stranger, produced
a less emphatic expression of surprise on
his part. " I will answer for her as for
myself," said Marion, warmly.

Heaven forbid that I should doubt of
either ! " responded the stranger. "Wherever,
during my wanderings, I have meta
woman, there I have been sure to find
a friend. Pity and fidelity are synonymous
with her name."

How can we serve you ? " said Marion,
glancing towards the interior of the cave,
where some heather, arranged with the
blossoms upwards, the hardy couch of the
Highlander, and the remains of a wood
fire, gave token of a residence of some
duration. You seem to want "

^^ Almost everything, madam!" in-tempted
he, gaily. " For my wardrobe,
you see its condition : witness my two
feet, with half a brogue between them.
Never was barefooted friar in fitter order
for a pilgrimage. And as to my larder,
that is reduced to a still lower ebb, as these
few crumbs may bear testimony. I doubt
if the leanest begging brother of St.
Francis was ever so sparely furnished.
I have been thinking, indeed, of making
an onslaught upon your venison. I must
have attempted it to-night, from sheer
starvation, though the report of fire-would

bring upon you twenty armed
men," rejoined Marion — ^^ would produce
instant discovery, perhaps instant death !
Heaven be praised you refrained, and that
Luath's curiosity led us here to supply
your wants. If it had been my father ! "

Or if Captain Archibald had happened

to gang along wi' Miss Marion the now,
instead of me'' interposed Janet — ^^wliilk |

Hush, Janet ! '' resumed her mistress, ;
blushing. ^^ We have no time to waste in

exclaimed the incorrigible lady's maid.

had listened with an air of suppressed ;

Mistress Janet ? "

Janet ! hold your peace, I entreat you !"
cried her lady, interrupting something that
the chattering damsel was about to say,

danger the most imminent. I feel that I
am speaking to one of the unfortunate followers
of the Pre of Charles Edward,"
continued she, cheering herself,
as her listener drew himself up proudly ;
sand it is right to inform him that he
is in the very midst of Argyle's country,
surrounded by enemies on all sides, parties
of soldiers in every direction, and an officer
in the service of the King — nay, this
is no time to quarrel for a word with one
who is risking much to preserve you — an
officer in King George's service actually
in the castle. What madness brought you
hither? You must not, cannot remain

your retreat to us, may make it known to

others. And then

The horrors of the executions at Kennington
— an account of which, transmitted
to her cousin by a friend from London, she
had that morning overheard him reading to

her father — struck at once upon her mind.
She thought of the young man before her,
evidently well-bon and delicately nurtured,
who, for a wrong cause it might be,
but still for one which he thought right,
was enduring so cheerfully the extremity
of human privation — she thought of him,
to-day talking with her, full of life and
spirit, tomorrow undergoing the fearful
sentence at which her flesh had crept as
she heard it ; and unable to bear the image
which her fancy had conjured up, she
burst suddenly into a passion of tears.

Much affected by her sensibility, the
object of her generous interest laid aside
his levity and his haughtiness, and explained
to her, simply and gravely, that,
having been closely and unrelentingly pursued
for many weeks, he had taken a sudden
resolution to baffle, if possible, the sagacity
of his enemies, by leaving the
friendly country in which he had hitherto

taken refuges and planting himself in the
very stronghold of his foes. The actual
spot in which he was concealed had
been suggested, he said, by the local
knowledge of a companion, who had
left him on the double errand of obtaining
important intelligence and recruiting their
stock of provisions ; but whose return,
unless he himself prevented his arrival by
meeting him at a rendezvous some twenty
miles distant, he expected to take place
two days after. This companion was, he
added, no stranger to Miss Marion Campbell,
whom he believed himself to have the
honour of addressing, and to whom the
house of Dungallan was certainly not unknown.


" Eh, pair Dungallan ! " exclaimed Janet,
whose sympathy extended to all her
mistress's lovers. "We ken him weel,
guide man ! he died me the vera brooch
that ye see i' my laddie, in return for an

auld glue that lie steal of my teddy's
forbye other tokens. Pair Dungallan ! —
sae it was he that sand the cove ! He
kent the place langsyne, did Dungallan ;
frae the time that he was a bairn, nae
higher than the hound Luath. An' ye
look for him the morn's morrow ! Eh,
sirs, but we maun pit a ewe-milk cheese
an' a wheen bannocks, to the pasty — he'll
be just famished — to sae nae thing of another
tass of the whisky."

Let him not come, I beseech you''
said Marion, earnestly. '' His danger
would be ten-fold greater than yours. He
is known. He is one of the chiefs of the
Cameronss— one of the principal planners
of this unhappy insurrection ; and said,
also, to be a personal favourite of its unfortunate
leader. I have known Dundalk
all my life long. His sister was my
early companion and instructress. Let me
not have the misery of fearing that an

old friend of my father's house should be
dragged from his lands to a dreadful death.
If he were taken, nothing could save him.
My interest in him would be misconstrued.
It would be thought — Heaven knows how
falsely ! — but it would be thought '' — proceeded
Marion, in a low tone, and blushing
deeply — "I know that it would be
suspected. Only this very morning, when
I spoke of poor Helen, the feeling burst
forth. His presence, whilst my hotheaded
kinsman is at the castle, would,
indeed, be dangerous to us all."

ye ken, just as Luath wad jalouse a brock
or a tod by the mere effect of natural
antipathy."

At this moment, the stranger — observing
that Luath, who had hitherto stood
<sound>quietly</sound>, and apparently half asleep, by
the side of his mistress, pricked up his
ears, and held his head slightly on one
side, in the attitude of listening — laid his
right hand firmly on his neck ; and, in
another instant, a quick <sound>step</sound> was heard in
the glen below, succeeded by a <sound>loud</sound>, lively
<sound>whistle</sound>, and a bold, manly <sound>voice</sound> calling,
Luath ! Where are you, Luath, my
man'' at short intervals. It was with
considerable difficulty that the caresses of
his lady, and the strong grasp of her companion,
could restrain Luath from obeying
the call. The <sound>footsteps</sound> were heard dashing
through the loose, dry, gravelly bed of

the wintry torrent ; pausing a moment, as
if the passer by were observing the marks
made by the girls in their recent ascent,
or as if his attention were attracted by the
suppressed <sound>growls</sound> of Luath, or his <sound>repeated</sound>
plunges, as he struggled with all his strength
to escape from his holders ; and in that
moment — a moment that seemed an age —
both Marion and Janet fancied that he
might have heard the quick beating of
their throbbing hearts. At length the
<sound>sound</sound> of the <sound>footsteps</sound> <sound>died</sound> away ; and the
<sound>voice</sound> and the <sound>whistle</sound> grew fainter and
fainter, and were gradually lost in the distance.
For the present, at least, the danger
was past.

After a long pause, Janet ventured a
<sound>whisper</sound>.

*^ Yen's Captain Archibald, calling Luath,
pair fellow — ^be quiet, Luath, can't ye ? —
just to find whereabout Miss Marion maybe.
Eh, sirs ! — there' d be wild work, I trow, gin
he and Dungallan should forgather !"

Their new acquaintance appeared to feel
the full force of this observation.

"Well," said he, "I must, if possible,
be off to-night. Heaven forbid that I
should lead my faithful friend, or you, my
kind protectress, into unnecessary danger !
Supply me — if, without peril to yourselves
you can do so — with so much of the commonest
food as may give me strength for
the journey, and a pair of shoes to guard
my feet from the rocks and briars, and the
tass of whisky which Mistress Janet spoke
of, to drink your health and happiness —
and I-will set forth this very night,"

'^ Ye ken the road ? " inquired Janet.

I have passed it once ; and have
learnt, in my wanderings, almost with the
skill of a wild Indian, to fix in my
memory the great landmarks of nature —
the outlines of the mountains, the course
of the streams, and the positions of the
stars in the heavens; nay, even to follow

upon the trail of a companion, by the aid
of almost imperceptible signs — a transverse
cut upon the smooth bark of the mountain
ash, a birch twig broken, a sprig of heather
dropped upon the path — tokens which,
even now that I have indicated them to
you, none but an eye quickened by keen
necessity and present danger could clearly
apprehend. Oh, this necessity is the
schoolmistress of all others, to sharpen
observation, and teach a man the use of
his wits ! We may dwell in a palace all
our lives, and not know for what purpose
our senses were given us ; but turn us,
barefoot and hungry, amongst these Scottish
wildernesses, and we soon find that
the chief aim and object of our faculties is
to enable us to make a shift — in which
grand art of existence I'll challenge any
canny Scot, Lowlander or Highlander,
from John o' Groat's House to the Tweed.
It will be moonlight to-nights'' added he,

more seriously, sand I have little doubt of
finding my way to the place where I have
appointed to join my Mend. So now, my
fair benefactress, I will detain you no
longer."

And he took her hand, and bent his lips
to it with an habitual grace and dignity ;
the effect of which was not at all diminished
by his rude and squalid exterior,
so independent of mere extrinsic circumstances
are those qualities of mind and
manner — that union of suavity and nobleness
— which constitute a gentleman. Marion
lingered.

'' The night is, of all seasons, the most
dangerous to a traveller, in these troubled
times. Even the fact of being out in the
dark exposes the wanderer to suspicion.
Could no disguise be thought of that
should enable you to elude suspicion by
day ? — a female garb, for instance? ''

The gentleman shall be welcome to

my best kirtle and bodice, and a hood
and screen to the wale of it," quoth Janet.
Eh, and he'll mak a braw strapping
lassie ! "

^^ A woman ! " replied the fugitive,
quickly. " There you must excuse me.
Anything but that. Braggart that I was,
I forgot my failure in that line. I'll play
the woman no more."

"No more ! " And Marion gazed fixedly
on his face, whilst a fresh suspicion
crossed her mind, and the colour mounted
even to her temples. '' 'No more ! "

"But he manna leave the cave, by
daylight, in a plaid and phillibeg of the
Cameron set. Gin he does, the captain,
or the <sound>loud</sound> Donald 'ill hoist him hint a
dragoon, and carry him wa to Inverary,
like pair doited Alison. There's wealth o'
auld tartans about the town, belonging to
ae laddie or another ; and I can lift him a
suit as cannily as ever my forbears lifted a

drove o' black cattle," said Janet, laiigiiing.
sand then, when he has trimmed that
beard o' his, while wad be as kenspeckle
in a kilt as in a kirtle, he may pass for as
douce a Campbell, honest man, as Loch-eden
himsel."

^^ My father went this morning to a
small hunting-lodge, and, having accidentally
left Luath behind, one of the lads
who attended him ran back to desire that,
unless my cousin should follow him tomorrow
— which it must be my care to
prevent — the dog might be sent after him
in the morning. Luckily, the messenger
met Janet before arriving at the castle,
and, after delivering his message to her,
returned immediately to his master; so
that, if your route, sir, should lie in that
direction, or in Whatsoever direction your
route may lie — for it Avill be better for
both of us that I should remain in my
present ignorance — your safety will be

best assured by taking Luatb, who is
known to the whole country; and a note
from myself to my father, which would be
your wan-ant with any parties of the
soldiery whom you might chance to meet.
So soon as you shall be clear of present
danger, set Luath free. He will speedily
iii home ; and his appearance "^dll be a
token — a most welcome token — of your
safety. Should you be taken, I rely upon
your honour to declare my dear father's
ignorance of this transaction. My own
share in it I am ready to abide."

Once again, and with deep emotion, he
for whose sake she was risking so much,
and who felt that she was herself fully
conscious of the peril which she incurred,
lifted her hand to his lips, as she stood on
the ledge of rock at the entrance of the
cave, ready to attempt the precipitous
descent.

*' A poor and homeless fugitive thanks

you, madam. The result of a more fortunate
attempt may one day enable him to
return, in his own behalf, or in that of him
whom he represents, some part of this obligation.
"When that time shall arrive,

send but a leaf of this flower" sand

he plucked a lingering blossom of the wild
briar that straggled into the cave, and
presented it to her.

Marion turned towards him with gentle
dignity.

^^God forbid that any wild and idle
words should lessen the readiness and
satisfaction with which I tender my poor
assistance to an enemy in distress ! But
if any circumstance could diminish those
feelings, it would be the finding him —
even in this moment of extremest wretchedness,
when the blood of his bravest
friends is flowing like water, and the lives
of weak and helpless women are perilled,
by the endeavour to save him from a similar

fate — looking forward, with exulting
hope, to a renewal of these scenes of agony.
Oh, sir ! if you be, as your words import,
of high and legitimate influence with him
in whose name this expedition has been
carried on, represent to him the utter desolation
which it has brought upon this
unhappy land ! "Warn him against incurring,
for that thorny wreath, a crown,
the tremendous responsibility of another
such convulsions. Whatever be the abstract
justice of his claim, the truest titles
to a throne — the blessing of God, and the
love of the people — rest with the House
of Brunswick ; and he and his gallant son
will find a nobler greatness, a sweeter
peace, in a patient acquiescence in the will
of Providence and the voice of the nation,
than in efforts which can but end in the
slaughter of their bravest and their most
faithful followers, and in rending asunder
the ties of friendship and of kindred, from

the castle to the hut. Save this devoted
country from the recurrence of scenes
heart-rending alike to friend and to foe,
and take with you my prayers and my
blessings. Blushing at her own earnestness,
she stopped suddenly. '' I accept
your flower," added she, in calmer tone,
'' not as an emblem — yet, see, the leaves
are already falling ! — but as a memorial.
Janet and Luath shall be with you as soon
as they can steal away after nightfall.
Farewell !"

And, attended by her faithful adherents,
she stepped into the narrow bed formed
by the waters, and slowly and cautiously
gained the path beneath.

Strange, yet noble creature !" muttered
the fugitive to himself, as he stood
at the entrance of the cavern, watching
her descent. " She has not made any
promise of secrecy ; but one feels that a
woman like that might be trusted with

VOL II. E

more tliaii life. Faith ! one might envy
the Elector of Hanover and Captain
Archibald Campbell such a subject and
such a mistress. The rose was dropping,
did she say ? Flowers are but foolish
emblems. There is an eagle, one of the
same sort that hovered above the vessel as
we approached the Scottish shore. Tulli-
jardine pointed it out to me at the time.
That were a fitter symbol ; and that sails
on." And, catching, as ambition is wont
to catch, at such auguries, he watched the
flight of the kingly bird, soaring upward
until it was lost in the distance; and then,
cheered by the omen, retired into his
place of refuge, with his usual sang froid
where excellent, as he had himself boasted,
at making a shift, he speedily kindled
some dry sticks, by snapping the lock of
his pistol, and setting light, by that means,
to the stump of a tobacco pipe, lengthened
sufficiently for use by the insertion of a

tube of oaten straw, applied himself
vigorously to the task of stifling the sense
of present ennui and future danger, and
the still more pressing claims of a keen
appetite in the fames of the 'fragrant
weed."

Marion, on her part, flushed and
agitated, contrived to reach home, unsuspected.
She walked straight into the
small room that she was accustomed to
call her parlour, which contained what
little property a Highland lady of that
day could call her own ; and Miss Marion
Campbell's possessions in that way were
the admiration of Argyleshire.

She boasted, besides the ordinary complement
of high-backed chas, narrow
settees, and diminutive tea-tables, a harpsichord,
a escritoire surmounted with glass
doors, serving at once for Inviting-desk
and book-case, and furnished with the
usual limited female library ; a japan

2

cabinet, well stuffed with choice china,
mixed with divers curiosities, natural and
artificial, of questionable beauty, and
not remarkable for preservation ; a glass
case of gorgeous <sound>humming</sound> birds ; and a
gilt cage, containing a recent gift of her
cousin — a bullfinch of great tameness, and
such extraordinary accomplishments, that
he not only drew his own water in an ingenious
bucket constructed for the purpose,
but attested his loyalty by piping
very successfully the whole of the national
anthem, from the first bar to the last, and
had completely won the old piper's affections,
by making certain indistinct and far-off
efforts to catch the notes of the
" Gathering of the Clan," as performed by
him for a full hour every morning,
walking up and down in front of the hall
door. Dutch tiles decorated the chimney,
India paper covered the walls, and the
little apartment had a look of snugness

hi

and comfort, hardly to have been expected

amongst the wild hills of the north. The

starry white jessamine, the everlasting

pea, and the hardy purple clematis —

*' The favoured flower
That bears the name of virgin's bower " —

were trained round the windows ; and a
half glass door opened upon a sheltered
flower-plot, bordered with thrift, and gay
with pinks, lark spurs, sweet-williams, and
garden lilies, intermixed with tall rose trees
and care f ally-trained bushes of Dutch
honeysuckle, each almost as short, and
quite as round, as a Dutch cheese ; whilst
another door, on the opposite side of the
room, led, by a narrow winding staircase,
to her sleeping chamber above.

It was a very complete lady's apartment ;
although most of the advantages of its insulation,
and its power of egress from
the castle without the knowledge of the
other inhabitants, had hitherto been

thrown away upon its fair possessor. She
now decided that Janet and Luath should
pass through the glass door, when setting
forth en their moonlight expedition.
There was, to be sure, a wall round one
side of the little flower garden into which
it opened ; whilst, on the other, it sank
abruptly to the lake from which her father
derived his territorial title ; but that wall
was in so precarious a state, and Janet so
strong and active, that there was little
doubt of her surmounting the difficulty.
As to Luath, he would clear it at a bound.
Sunny and cheerful was Marion's little
parlour, with its in-door comforts and
luxuries, and its out-door prettiness, its
pleasant garden, and its sidelong peep of
the calm clear waters, shut in by sheltering
hills ; and cheerful and simony had
been the temper with which the young
Scottish maiden — high-born, healthful,
and fair, the beloved and only daughter of

a kind and indulgent father, the betrothed
bride of the man whom she loved best in
the world — had been wont to return to it,
to pursue her ordinary avocations, after
her daily ramble among the mountains, or
by the lake side.

I^ow her mood was changed. Anxious,
uneasy, unquiet, the secret with which
she had become acquainted — a secret
which she felt must be imparted to no one,
save her faithful Janet — must be held
sacred at every risk — weighed upon her
like a sin. She sate down to her escritoire,
with the double purpose of depositing,
in one of its little recesses, the half-fallen
rose, (for, with the softened feeling
so natural to a woman, when rendering, at
a great risk, a great service, she had
already relented towards him by whom it
had been presented,) and of writing the
important billet, which, with Luath, was
to form his passport ; but, harassed with

doubts whether, in following the impulse
of the moment, she had done right or
wrong, and weighed down by the horrible
responsibility belonging to her situation,
she had no sooner folded the flower carefully
in silver paper, and cleared one of
the pigeon-holes for its reception, than,
with an irresistible movement of see-pity,
mingled, it may be, with a shade of self-distrust,
she laid her head upon her hand,
and burst into tears.

Her heart, somewhat relieved by that
great female comfort and privilege, a
hearty fit of <sound>crying</sound>, she lifted up her head,
with the intention of writing her letter
forthwith, and chasing the subject, as
much as might be, from her mind, when
her attention was arrested by a packet,
which she had dislodged from its place in
depositing the token-flower, and which
had unrolled itself in falling, and now
lay open before her eyes.



It was a water-colour drawings of great
finish and beauty, executed by Helen, and
representing the two friends in a glen near
the castle. Marion, richly dressed, was
seated in the foreground ; one little hand
thrown round the neck of the faithful
Luath, whose honest countenance, always
animated and intelligent, was awakened
into double life by the report of Dun gallants
gun, whose figure was seen farther
down the glen, firing at a red deer, bounding
by. Helen had drawn herself in profile,
standing behind her companion, accoutred
in plaid and bodice, as a Highland
lassie, and setting off, by her darker complexion
and simpler garb, the delicate and
swanlike loveliness of the young beauty of
Locheden.

Even in this picture, the unselfish and
amiable character of the artist might be
traced. Herself eminently handsome, she
had cast into the shade her own graceful

figure and noble features, and had given
all her care to heighten the charms of her
friend.

Marion's spirits, already weakened, could
not resist the flood of recollection that
burst upon her at sight of this drawing,
and of some stanzas which had served it
for an envelope ; slight, but graceful
verses, in which the poet had mingled,
with fond praises of his sister's skill as a
portrait paint ter, very intelligent hints of
his own devotion to the fair original.

^^ Poor Helen ! " sighed she ; " poor,
poor Dungallan ! "

The <sound>sigh</sound> was <sound>echoed</sound> from behind her,
and turning round, with a shock of nervous
trepidation, she saw her Cousin Archibald
leaning upon her chair.

'^ I beg your pardon, Miss Campbell,
for daring to look over you," said he,
somewhat stiffly; 'but having, after
despatching answers to communications of

some consequence, sought you in your
usual works, and receiving, upon my
returning to the castle, the most contradictory
answers to my questions as to your
whereabout,' I was tempted, by the open
door, and the sight of my friend Luath, to
use my old privilege of the entree and
make my appearance in your withdrawing
room. Old Angus informed me that you
were walking, and well ; Mistress Janet,
on the contrary, said that you were at
home and indisposed ; and, without
intending, believe me, to intrude upon
meditations which were clearly not
intended to meet the general eye, I could
not resist the temptation to inquire
personally, which of the two reports was
correct."

^^ Both were right, to a certain point,"
said Marion, with some effort. '' I walked
out, as I generally do, after breakfast, and
returned, not ill, indeed, but less well than
usual."

'^ It pleased Mistress Janet to deny that
you had bean out at all," persisted Archibald
drily ; eyeing, with no good will, the
waiting damsel, who had, by this time,
made her way into the apartment, and
was busying herder in collecting her lady's
bonnet and shawl. " However, to let that
matter rest. I wished to warn you against
rambling about unattended, at this particular
time. Intelligence has been received
that one of the prime leaders in this
rebellion, the very chief over whose
portrait, conjoined with your own, I find
you weeping, has been traced to this neighbourhood."


'^ Eh, sirs ! Dungallan ! Goodness save
him, pair chiel,frae the bloody redcoats!"
was the ejaculation of Janet.

'^ Whether there be more truth in the
exploded doctrine of sympathies than it
suits the philosophers of this enlightened
age to admit, '^ continued Archibald, doggedly,
^^or whether trio interest which you

and Mistress Janet there, are pleased to
testify in this fate, together with this mysterious
walk, may serve to solve the enigma
of his lurking about a place so remote from
his own country, and apparently surrounded
by enemies, remains to be determined.
At all events, the coincidence is
curious."

^^My grateful affection for his sister,
the daughter of my poor mother's dearest
friend, the friend and instructress of my
own childhood, might well account for any
interest that I might take in Dungallan's
fate," said Marion, rousing herself as she
perceived the effect which her passive
dejection and <sound>silent</sound> acquiescence in his
suspicions, was producing upon the jealous
temper of her lover. " If he fell a victim
to these cruel, cruel laws, poor Helen's
happiness would be ruined for ever."

Sisters are convenient persons," observed
Captain Campbell. "I am unfortunate

in not possessing one; although,
even if I were happy enough to boast a
relation as accomplished as Miss Helen
Cameron, I should lack the skill to set off
her presents with a garnish of love verses.
I am none of " these same metre ballad-longer,
thank Heaven !" added he, with
increasing bitterness. " I am of Hotspur's
mind, and

Had rather hear a brazen candlestick turned,
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree ;
And that would nothing set my teeth on edge,
nothing so much as mincing poetry.' "

"As for my walk, this morning," began
Marion, desirous of turning the conversation,
" that " — Fettered by the recollection
of all that had passed in that morning's
walk, and heart-struck by the sternness
of his gaze, her voice faltered, and she
suddenly stopped.

" What have I done, Archibald, that
you should look at me and speak to me so

unkindly ? " said she, after a short pause,
turning to him, with the tears streaming
down her cheeks, and a sweetness and
earnestness of manner that won its way
instantly to the lover's heart. He
soothed and apologised, and, before they
parted to dress for dinner, a perfect reconciliation
had taken place, and he had
vowed, for the fiftieth time, never again
to suffer a shade of jealousy to pass across
his mind.

Such vows are easily made ; but to keep
them requires a cooler temperament than
that of Archibald Campbell : twenty times,
that very afternoon, was the stifled passion
upon the brink of bursting forth.

We must all have felt, even although
we may have been fortunate enough not
to have a secret of life and death in our
charge, like poor Marion, how difficult it
i&amp;, when the mind is filled with one subject,
to keep up an easy and unembarrassed

conversation upon any other; the more
especially when our companion is one to
whom we have been accustomed to confide
every thought as it happened to arise. In
such a situation, not only is our behaviour
embarrassed and constrained, but there is
a sort of spell over our faculties, so that,
in steering clear of the one great danger,
we run foul of all sorts of minor perils,
and say and do, we hardly know what, ina
vain endeavour to cover the awkwardness
of our real position.

In the present case, for instance, Marion
affected an exuberance of animal spirits,
depressing, rather than exhilarating, to the
listener ; and as different from her general
easy cheerfulness, as the rouge of a haggard
court beauty, from the natural coloring
of youth and health. She rattled on the
harpsichord, with a rapidity which put
melody quite out of the question, the liveliest
tunes that she could recollect ; <sound>sang</sound>.

in a voice from which her usual arch sweetness
was banished by agitation, the gayest
of her national songs ; choosing, quite unconsciously
to herself, but in a manner
which her auditor did not fail to remark,
such airs as she had been accustomed to
sing with Helen, and those which had
been the particular favourites of her brother;
and when, at last, she had quite exhausted
herself with the exertion, she rose
from the harpsichord, and, taking up the
apron that she was flowering, requested
that he would read to her while she
worked, as Dungallan used to do to Helen.

It was now the Captain's turn to show
that a tete-tete between two lovers is not
always so saccharine a matter as is erroneously
supposed.

Turning over the newest books that he
could find amongst her collection, he lighted
upon Eichardson's great novel, then in
course of publication, the unknown catas-

VOL. II. F

trophies of which excited so much curiosity
and interest, not merely amidst the flowerbed
of young ladies by whom the author
was surrounded, but amongst some score of
persons of quality, who despatched letter
after letter (one of them — Lady bradshaw
— even writing upon her knees) to
ask for the reformation of the hero, and a
happy conclusion to the story, with as
earnest supplications, and as strong reasons
to back their petition, as if they had
been pleading for the real, actual, life-long
felicity of two real, actual, living and
existing human beings — the strongest tribute,
by the way, to the power of the book,
to its extraordinary verisimilitude and
truthfulness, ever received by any author.
One of Lovelace's most characteristic
letters did Captain Campbell address himself
to read, avoiding, with the instinct of
a high-bred gentleman, all that could be
painful to female delicacy, and giving to

the racy wit, the eloquent sophistry of that
remarkable creation of Eichardson's genius,
all the advantage of the most intelligent
and animated elocution ; so that Marion's
attention was excited, in spite of herself.

"What a wretch !" exclaimed she, ashe
finished the account of one of his most
teazing interviews with poor Clarissa.
"What a cruel, unfeeling, cold-hearted
wretch I"

I don't know that," replied Archibald,
(Be it remembered, in vindication of my
hero, that only four volumes out ®f the
eight had yet been published, and that
Lovelace's final resolution was still in suspense.)
^^ I don't know that. The lady
seems to me to have been quite as coldhearted
as the gentleman; or, rather,
hearts on both sides seem to have been
pretty much out of the question. She,
justly, as you will say, distrusted his
honour ; and he, with at least as much

justice, doubted of her affection. The whole
affair seems to me a game of chess, at
which — barring false moves, which it is
the author's business to guard against — ■
the most skilful player will be sure to
prove victorious. All you ladies exclaim,
Poor Clarissa !' and, if she had loved
him, I should be as ready as the best of
you to echo the <sound>cry</sound>. But love is synonymous
with confidence, and this paragon of
her sex does not know what the word
means. If she had relied upon him !— if
she had trusted him ! One wonders that
Eichardson did not see how much his book
would have gained in interest by representing
Clarissa as enamoured of Lovelace;
but he lives amongst ladies, and piques
himself, it is said, upon his knowledge of
the female heart ; and, therefore, it is
not wonderful that he should show them
as he sees them, and as they are," added
he bitterly, delighting in tormenting those

that love them best. Poor Clarissa, indeed
! rather, poor Lovelace !''

At this moment, it was some relief to
Marion, whose apron had certainly not
improved by her afternoon's labours, that
the weather, which had been louring all
the afternoon, now assumed the appearance
of one of the terrific storms of those
mountain regions. The evening closed in
prematurely, the clouds gathered dark and
heavy, the wind <sound>moaned</sound> in gusts through
the dark firs, and swept across the lake,
whilst quick flashes of sharp, rapid lightning
gleamed at the edge of the horizon,
and the <sound>growl</sound> of distant <sound>thunder</sound>, <sound>proclaimed</sound>,
in [Nature's fullest voice, the
gathering of the coming tempest.

The momentary passions of men were
hushed before it. The lover sate, contemplating,
by the fitful glare of the lightning,
the fair face of his beloved, pallid and sad
from anxiety and sorrow ; and once again
his heart smote him for his unkindness.

^^ Marion, dearest Marion, do not you
play the distrustful maiden nth me,
who, Heaven knows, have no desire upon
this earth, but your happiness and
honour ! Be frank with me — confide in
me, I conjure you ! I see, I loiow, that
there is a secret that weighs upon your
mind at this moment. Trust it to me,
and you shall not repent your reliance.
Shew me but what you wish, and it shall
be done. My power in this district is
greater than you know of; my intelligence
more accurate than you suspect. Say only,
^Dungallan is my friend's brother, and
therefore I wish to save him ; ' say even,
^ Dungallan is my own early friend — and
he shall be saved.' Only think me worthy
of jour confidence, and see how I will
deserve it. say; even — although the
thought be fatal to my every hope of
happiness — even if his danger have
revealed to you feelings hitherto unsuspected,
and if, in aiding his escape, I give

assistance to a favoured rival — yet, for
your dear sake, to spare you the misery
you would feel if lie were taken, I swear
to befriend him, at whatever peril it maybe.
I am not now on service, and there
is only one of those unfortunate fugitives
whom it would be eternal dishonour for a
soldier to preserve. For Dungallan, since
your happiness seems bound up in his
safety, I will not hesitate to risk rank,
fortune, life itself. Only trust me, only
confide in me, if not as your devoted lover,
yet as your nearest kinsman, your truest
friend ! Speak to me, I conjure you,
Marion ! I beseech you, — speak !"

He hung over her affectionately, as he
delivered, with an earnest truthfulness
that could not be mistaken, this outburst
of fond and disinterested love, gazing in
her face as he spoke, and grasping, withall
the fervour of passion, her cold and
trembling hands.

^^ "Will you not answer me ? Do you
disdain even to reply to my offer of service
^my most sincere and honest offer ? You
do ! I see plainly that you do ! I see
and feel, too plainly, that you desire my
absence ; and I will no longer intrude
upon your privacy. Farewell, madam !
May you find a truer and a more devoted
heart than that which you have spurned
from you !"

And, lingering a moment on the threshold,
in the hope, it may be, of being
recalled, he left the room.

Marion wrung her hands in bitterness
of vexation. Soever had her heart so
yearned towards the kinsman, the friend,
the betrothed bridegroom, whom she had
suffered to leave her, probably for ever.

Oh, that I dared to undeceive him !
But, for his own sake, I dare not, I must
not. I have pledged myself to this adventure,
and I must abide the trial. May

the God of mercy — who lias willed that
we should assist a fellow creature in distress,
who has gifted woman with a strength
of sympathy which almost counterbalances
her feebleness of body — may He grant
that I bear it with firmness ! It is a fearful
night, Janet," continued she, addressing
the faithful soubrette, who just now
entered the apartment, ^^ Janet, do you
fear to encounter the storm ? If you do,
say so honestly, and I will go myself. I
have no right to impose upon your kindness
and fidelity a danger from which I
should shrink. There is little left. Heaven
knows, that should make me cling to life.
Speak frankly, my good iii. If your heart
fails you, say so at once."

Janet's answer was bold and confident.
And, somewhat soothed by the fearless
readiness of her confidante, her predictions
that they should succeed in their' enterprise,
and that all jealousies and suspicions

would be ultimately cleared up (for her
acuteness did not fail to detect the chief
source of her lady's despondency), Marion
sat down to write, with more firmness than
she had expected to be able to command,
the important billet to her father, which,
in case of the fugitive being intercepted by
the soldiers, would, she believed, from the
respect paid to the name of one of the most
loyal and most powerful chiefs of the
powerful and loyal house of Campbell,
prove an effectual and unquestionable
passport.

Her letter was short and simple; stating
only that, as Captain Archibald Campbell
had resolved not to join Locheden in
his hunting expedition, she had sent
Luath by the bearer ; that all was well at
the Castle ; and that, wishing good sport
to her dear father, she hoped to see him
return in a few days.

Armed with this document, and laden

vrith. the promised provisions, the Venison
pasty and the whisky (" lifted," to use
Janet's own phrase), together with a certain
pair of " shoon," belonging to her lover,
Donald, plaid garments of the Campbell
set, and a collar and chain for Luath, the
faithful waiting damsel, followed by the
no less faithful hound, took the opportunity
of a lull in the storm to set forth
upon her expedition.

Marion accompanied them as far as the
garden wall, which Janet and her forfeited
attendant cleared with somewhat
more of difficulty than she had anticipated,
and then returned alone to her solitary
apartment, to start at every <sound>sound</sound>, and
feel each moment, as it passed, marked by
the beatings of her own anxious heart.

Sadly and wearily the hours dragged
along. The tempest had returned with
tenfold violence ; and Marion, as she
found the <sound>noises</sound> in the castle subsiding,
one by one, giving token that the inhabitants

had retired to rest, and that she
remained the only watcher within its
walls — whilst over the pelting rain and
<sound>moaning</sound> wind without, <sound>burst</sound> ever and
anon peals of <sound>thunder</sound>, <sound>reverberating</sound> in
awful grandeur amongst the mountains,
preceded by lightning that glared with
livid and horrible lustre through the room
began to feel the pressure of a close-clinging
fear, a down-weighing responsibility,
as the possible fate of her attached
dependent flashed across her mind. If
her courage should give way as she returned
alone, and she should fall in the
darkness from the ledge of the rock ! If
the springs on the hill-top should rise
suddenly, and, joining the gatherings from
the pouring rain, gush down the channel
of the winter water-course ! If she should
be struck by the lightning ! Either of
these thoughts was too terrible to dwell
upon.

The distant <sound>clap</sound> of a door within the

mansion, followed, as she thought (for the
dizzying bounding of her own pulses, the
<sound>throbbing</sound> of her heart and brain, were
such as to confuse all outward <sound>sounds</sound>) by
the rapid <sound>footsteps</sound> of a man along the
galleries and through the vaulted passages
of the old building, harbingers yet
another fear. If Janet should be pursued !
If she should be intercepted ! If the
stranger should be discovered ! She heard,
or she thought she heard, the castle gate
unfastened ; and, the feeling of suspense
becoming insupportable, she ventured to
open gently the door of her little parlour,
when a <sound>rush</sound> of wind, as if from an outer
door left open, extinguished her taper,
and left her in all the horror that a darkness
as of midnight, interrupted only by
the now less frequent flashes of the lightning,
could add to her former terror.

The <sound>storm</sound> was at length abating. She
found her way to the glass door, and

opened it; and after an interval that
seemed to last hours rather than minutes,
she was aware of Luath, as he came bounding
up the path, followed — could it be the
<sound>footsteps</sound> of two persons that she heard,
advancing with stealthy rapidity ? A moment
decided the question. Janet rushed
fearfully in, dragging after her, her, as it
seemed, unwilling companion; and, first
carefully locking and bolting the door, and
barring the shutters, an operation which,
in spite of the darkness, she performed
with singular dexterity, she then contrived
to thrust the stranger (for it was no other)
up the staircase leading to Marion's sleeping
apartment ; and, having locked that
door also, and deposited the key in her
pocket, began relating to her lady, in cautious
<sound>whispers</sound>, but with her usual volubility,
the causes which had induced her to
resolve upon the bold measure of bringing
him to the castle.

They had been pursued. The rain had
rendered the descent from the cave so dangerous,
and had so flooded the path below,
that the fugitive, forgetting his own
danger in the manly duty of protecting a
female, had insisted, in spite of Janet's
earnest remonstrances, on escorting her as
far at least as the wall over which she had
effected her exit from the castle gardens.
The light, shielded from the action of the
wind by an ingeniously-contrived lanthorn
of oiled paper, by the aid of which he had
contrived to obtain for her a safe footing
down the face of the precipice, had, she
imagined, been observed from the upper
windows of the castle.

Certain it was, that, before they reached
the spot to which the fugitive had insisted
upon accompanying her, they had heard
<sound>footsteps</sound> at some distance behind them,
and had, as the clouds partially cleared
away, and the moon emerged for a few

moments, been enabled to perceive that
their pursuer was a soldier. Janet declared
her conviction that it must be either
*^ Captain Archie himsel', or the <sound>loud</sound>
Donald," come to reclaim "the plaids and
shoon," which she had boasted, with so
much glee, of having 'lifted" from her
military admirer, a few hour's before.
Some one from the house it certainly
was; for Luath had recognized him, and,
giving a sudden jerk to the chain by
which he was held, had succeeded in freeing
himself, and bounding towards the
intruder, although he had returned to
them upon hearing her voice.

Under these circumstances, the active
waiting-maid had, with great presence of
mind, availed herself of a stunted pollard
oak, which concealed and facilitated the
passage over the wall to the garden, and
(first dashing away the tell-tale light) had
literally hauled up, after her, both her

companions, each of whom had, for a wonder,
as she observed, been gifted with
sufficient sense to submit to her guidance.

*' III bea' that weary lantern !" quoth
Janet, " I tempt the gentleman, gin he wad
stay quiet i' the cave, I'd nae fear o' getting
safe to the foot o' the rock. Wi' my
plaids rowed round me, and name to look
on, I should hae slid down the path, ye
ken, like a saw wreath at Yule. But he
wadna be guidit. I'm minded that he's
ane that has ta'en his ain gate owe lang.
Weel, but ye maun hae a light ! " And
off she ran, finding her way through the
darkness with the security and ease which
seems one of the many privileges of the
light-hearted and the fearless.

During her absence, a fresh perplexity
occurred to her mistress. Horses were
heard galloping into the court, and a violent
<sound>knocking</sound> at the gate was succeeded
by a parley between Captain Archibald,
and the visitors. The voice of one of

them was, she thought, familiar to lier;
and, to her unspeakable consternation, she
found that he was advancing with Janet
towards the apartment ; Janet talking at
the top of her voice, to give notice of his
approach to her lady.

Foot the night. General ! Xa, indeed,
hae we not, except indeed to ca' Luath,
poor hound, who's aye ganging forth in
the rain. Sae my teddy and I we got a
wee wet, and the wind put out the taper,
and sae" —

Whilst Janet thus " followed her instinct
as a lady's maid, and lied," her
companion. General Campbell, closely followed
by Archibald, stepped forward into
the room, where Marion sate trembling
with anxiety and apprehension.

'^ I intrude upon you only for an instant,
my fair cousin, late as is the hour and indisposed
as I regret to see you are, merely
to announce to you that I shall, tomorrow,
early, be obliged to steal away your

visitor, whose presence is required in
Edinburgh, to meet his brother, and Lord
and Lady Bellasis, and their pretty daughter
Lady Betty. Give my compliments to
Locheden, and tell him we have accounts
of the rebel chief, Dungallan, one of the
ringleaders, having ventured into Argyle's
country. Tell him that we have taken
care of the land passes, and that we shall
borrow the castle boat in the morning, to
despatch a messenger across the loch. And
now, good night. Go to bed, my dear,
and refresh your roses. I don't like those
pale cheeks." And, with a kind pressure
of the hand, the good General quitted the
apartment. Archibald lingered behind.

^^You hear that Dungallan, that this
favoured friend I presume you call him,
has been traced into this neighbourhood,
that he is even supposed to be upon this
estate. Why do I speak of reports and
suppositions when I know that he is here?"
added Captain Campbell, impressively.

G 2

Marion CAMPBELL.

You are mistaken ! Indeed you are
mistaken !" rejoined his cousin.

mistaken! — when I saw him enter
the garden this very night ! — when I can
track his footsteps across this room ! —
when here is his glove dropped upon the
floor ! dropped at the very door which
leads to your bedchamber, and to your
bedchamber only !" cried he bitterly, flinging
from him with violence the glove
which he had picked up. '* The rebel is
here, and I know not what weakness
hinders me from doing my duty as an
officer in the King's service, and delivering
him up at once to the General."

"Do as seems best to you. Captain
Campbell," said Marion faintly. "My life,
and far more than my life, my reputation,
are in your power. Deal with me as
you will."

Nay, madam, your safety, and the
honour of my kinsman's house, must ever

be sacred in my eyes. Unkindly, cruelly
as you have treated me, I cannot forget
what we once were to each other. I warn
you, however, that escape is impossible.
You will live to repent this night's work.
Farewell for ever ! " And, without even
a parting glance, he hurried out of the
room.

Ye are mair like to repent this night's
work yersel, captain'' observed Janet,
<sound>quietly</sound>, as she bolted the door after him,
and addressed herself to the double task of
comforting her lady and releasing the prisoner.
^^ Gin the land-passes be waylaid,
we maun try the loch. I'll gie a gay guess
that the castle bathe '11 be mission' the
morn."

And so it was managed. In less than
two hours, the stranger, accompanied by
Luath, was rowing across the loch; whilst,
at daybreak the next morning, General
Campbell and Archibald took their departure
for Edinburgh.

Time dragged heavily on. Luath lead
returned, weary and travel-stained, without
either his absence or his arrival having
excited any suspicion in the castle. Nothing
had been heard of the letter ; and
Marion had the satisfaction of believing
that the sacrifice of her happiness had not
been made in vain, that she had at least
succeeded in rescuing the object of her
compassion.

Locheden had, upon his return, found
his daughter sick and drooping; and, as
days lengthened into vi^eeks, and weeks
into months, and left the prolonged absence
of her lover unexplained, the old chief
began to chafe with anger and impatience.
He had heartily approved of a match
which would unite his only child to the
heir-male to whom, in default of a son, his
own estate would descend, and who, besides
his personal good gifts, and his high
reputation for gallantry and military skill,
inherited, in right of his English mother,

a property wliicli might be reckoned enormous
for a Highlander in those days ; but
this neglect of one whom he regarded as
the very apple of his eye, awakened all the
irritability of his nature, and his fierce
displeasure added tenfold, as that particular
way of proving affection commonly does
add, to the distress of her by whose injuries,
real or supposed, his wrath had been
originally excited.

Affairs were in this position, when, one
fine morning in October, despatches arrived
from General Campbell, calculated to increase,
if that were possible, the previous
exasperation. After announcing his intention
to visit Locheden, almost as soon
as his letter could reach them, accompanied
by their young kinsmen, (Captain
Archibald's next brother, John, being an
officer in his own regiment, ) he proceeded
to say: —

"You will have heard, I am sure, with

great pleasure (for I take for granted that
the bridegroom elect has apprised you of his
good fortune,) of our gallant cousin's intended
marriage with Lady Betty Bellasis,
the English heiress and beauty, who has
made so great a sensation in Edinburgh
this summer. There have been difficulties,
of course, upon the score of fortune and
country with the Earl and Countess, but
love has conquered them all ; and the chief
object of our journey to Locheden is to
consult you, the kinsman, guardian, and
friend, to whom both these young men are
so deeply indebted, upon the arrangements
as to residence and settlements, which this
happy event will render necessary. The
bridegroom elect is, in every way, a lucky
fellow. In addition to her fortune and
her beauty, la future is as charming a
creature as one shall see on a summer's
day — a fit companion for your sweet
Marion, my pet and favourite. Heaven
send them happy together !"

A Lowlander ! an Englishwoman ! an
heiress ! — fortune-hunter ! rascal ! scoundrel,
that he is !" exclaimed the old chieftain,
throwing from him the unlucky
letter, and striding up and down the hall,
in breathless wrath. " And the doited
idiot of a General, to even her with my
Marion — the Sassenach doll ! Let them
take care how they speak of my daughter !
Old as I am, the blood of M'Callamore
runs as red in my veins as in theirs Only

let them dare to lightly her " And the

very excess and fierceness of his anger
took away the power of expression.

Marion listened tremblingly, delaying
till calmer moments any attempts to soothe
and expostulate.

'^ Coming, are they?" burst forth the
enraged father. ^^ Coming ! — ay, by
Heaven !" continued he, catching a glimpse
of a party of horsemen approaching the
castle — " here they come. And they think

to find entrance, do they?" added lie
bitterly. '^ They come to take account of
our accommodations, that they may bring
their braw young bride to insult over the
old man and his daughter ! Let them
wait until I be dead. Not a foot shall
that villain set in Locheden, until he
walks over ray corpse. Angus ! Duncan !
Where are the loons loitering ? See that
the gates be barred ! Let none enter !'^

'' Stay, I implore you, I conjure you,
my dearest father ! For my peace and
happiness, for the honour and dignity of
your daughter and your house, refrain
from this violence ! Give entrance to
them all. Receive them as usual. I ask
you, in the name of maiden pride, of
maiden modesty, to restrain all demonstrations
of anger. Let him not imagine, let
him not suspect — — God knows how sincerely
I wish him happy," cried Marion.
Give them admittance, I exhort you, I



entreat you ! Let them see no difference !
Surely you will not vex and grieve your
poor child. Yield to me in this, I implore
you, dearest father I'' And she threw her
arms round his neck, leaned her head on
his shoulder, and <sound>wept</sound>.

He kissed her with the fondest affection.
'' You are an angel, my darling, and shall
have your own Away in everything. Compare
an English moppet with my noble
Marion ! The scoundrel will be miserable
that's my comfort. His father married
a Lowlander for the sake of the silver, a
peevish Southron dame, that worried the
life fairly out of him — and so will this
great laddie. "We are weel rid o' the loon.
Dungallan, puis* laddie, 's Avorth twenty of
him. He's won safe to France, ye ken,
to his sister; and, gin we can save the
estate from the clutches of thaeEnglishers,"
said the old chieftain, losing ?ds English
as he lost his temper, and checking himself

as lie perceived the effect his hint
produced upon his daughter. weel!
Aveel ! We'll no talk of that the now.
You shall see how civil I'll be to the
villain. I'll no condescend to be angry.
I'll take a lesson out of his ain book, and
be as cause and fair as himsel'. Here the
rascal comes. You shall see how doubly
I'll behave. Eh, now, that sic a perjured
traitor should look so like an honest man !"
That Locheden fully intended his behaviour
to be as false and fair as he believed
his kinsman, there is no manner of doubt.
But the inveterate truthfulness of threescore
years was too much for his new resolution.
He did not, it is true, bar his
gates against his visitors, nor kick them
out of doors, being entered. But he drew
back haughtily from their proffered hands,
with a look as fierce and wild as one of his
own mountain eagles, and eyed Archibald,
in particular, as if he had a mind to knock

him down. General Campbell, a kind and
acute person, and a man of the world, saw,
at a glance, that something was amiss,
and, determining not to enter upon family
matters imtil the aspect of affairs should
be somewhat cleared, began, after an
affectionate expression of regret at Marion's
pale cheeks, to talk over the news of the
day.

^^ You have heard the grand piece of
intelligence, I presume, Locheden, that
this foolish young man, the Pretender,
who has occasioned us so much trouble in
chasing him up and down the country, has
given us the slip at last, and got clear off
to France. The thing is really so. Besides
the accounts in the public papers, which
are sufficiently precise and particular, I
have a letter myself from a French friend,
the Comte de Clement, who actually saw
him land. Why, heyday ! my pretty
Marion," quoth the good General, observation

CA]\rPBELL.

ing the involuntary clasping of lier hands,
and the sudden rush of blood that coloured
her fair face to the brow, as she listened
to his words with breathless interest —
*what should there be in this news to
make you brighten up on a sudden? You
are no damsel of the "White Rose, I hope ?
No Flora M'Donald exploits here ? Eh,
Locheden ?'' And he turned to relate to
the chief all that was then known of the
escape of Charles Edward ; whilst Archibald,
to whom her emotion was as a flash
of light that showed him the whole thing
at a glance, advanced to his fair cousin.

"He^ then, and not Dungallan, was the
stranger at the cave ? Charles Edward, the
Pretender, the Chevalier, the Prince ? "

" I^ay, give him what title you will. I
am no damsel of the White Rose, as the
General calls it ; although I risked much —
ay, and would risk much again — to preserve
a fugitive in peril of his life, thrown,

under such extraordinary circumstances,
upon my poor resources for protection and
assistance."

^^ But why not intrust me with the
secret ? Why occasion so much unnecessary
pain — certainly to me — may I not say
to both of us ? "

"To laye trusted you, Captain Campbell,
an officer in the service of the King of
England, with such a secret as that, however
the confidence might have relieved
and comforted myself, would have been to
endanger your professional reputation, your
honour, perhaps even your life. !Neo, I
cannot think that I was wrong ! The more
especially," added she, in a lower voice,
and with peculiar sweetness and gentleness
of manner — " the more especially, as the
transient pain must have been long forgotten
in your late and present happiness.
Heaven knows, I congratulate you most
sincerely."

Happiness ! — congratulate ! " echoed
Captain Campbell, in unfeigned astonishment.


^^ Marion, my dow!" said her father,
striding rapidly across the room — "I have
done a great injustice. It's no our friend
here, but Johnny, his brother, that's about
to marry Lady Betty, who seems to be a
fine spunky lassie, for all she has the ill
luck to be an English. Archie, my lad,
I crave your pardon for thinking you could
be such a villain ! " And the old chief and
the young soldier shook hands, with hearty
affection and goodwill.

"There has been a small mistake on
both sides, as it seems'' observed General
Campbell, joining the little group ; "but
matters are clearing up now, to judge from
the gentleman's smiles and the lady's
blushes; and, if I be permitted to advise,
the best way to prevent a recurrence of
doubts and misgivings, would be to have

both the weddings on the same day. What
say you, Mistress Janet ? " For that faithful
dependent, very anxious upon her
lady's account, and it may be a little inquisitive
upon her own, had contrived, on
some pretence or other, to edge herself
into the room. " What say you ? "

'•^ I gie my consent," responded Janet ;
^ barring jealousy and a' sic nonsense, for
the time to come. The captain and the
<sound>loud</sound> Donald faith ken that I forewarned
them what yon night's work would come
to. But ye men folk are aye rash and
headstrong — ye canna help yourselves —
it's born wi' ye ; and we women are sat
and complying — that's our nature; sae,
sin' ye hae repent, we maun e'en forgive
ye," quoth Janet, *^ an' tak ye for better
for worse."

And so it was settled.

Lii on liquid roses floating !

So floats yon foam o'er pink champagne.
Fain would I join such pleasant boating,
And prove that ruby main,
And float away on wine !

And true it is they drown old Care,
But what care we for him.
So we but float on wine !

"So you really wrote this, Giovanni?"
said the young and pretty Beatrice Alberti,
as she sat on a terrace of her brother's
villa, overlooking the Yah d' Arno. " Sing
it to me. I want to hear it in your own
voice. Can Antonio play the air ?''

I was originally indebted for this Anacreontic —
almost an impromptu — to a friend whom I am proud
to name, Mr. Kenyon ; and although it has since
been printed in a collection of his own poems, I
cannot find in my heart to play my readers false by
substituting an inferior song of my own.

H 2

And the little page ran rapidly over the
notes, and then accompanied the conte's
rich, mellow, baritone voice, in a <sound>melody</sound>
as rich and flowing as the verses. Both
the <sound>singing</sound> and the playing were full of
right Italian taste ; and the fair Florentine,
charmed with both the words and the air,
was evidently not a little proud of her gay
and gallant brother, whose talent as a
poet she had never even suspected.

'' Well," said Giovanni, when he had
concluded, " will this do, Beatrice ?"
Will that Anacreontic win me the laurel
wreath to-night at the Palazzo Eiccardi,
think you ?"

Beatrice started from her seat in
astonishment.

You go to the Palazzo P.iccardi ! You
contend for the laurel crown! You,
Giovanni Alberti, who, since you were the
height of Antonio there, have done nothing
but laugh at that old precieiise^ the

marchesa, with her pedants and her poets,
and all the trumpery of all the Delia
Etruscans transported into a lady's saloon I
You are making a fool of me, brother !
You never can mean it !"

I am perfectly in earnest, I assure
you," replied the conte, looking, or rather
trying to look, as grave as an habitually
joyous and hilarious temperament would
permit. '' I have repented of my sins of
scoffing and mockery, and mean to make
that venerable priestess of the Muses all
possible amends by enacting the part of
her Monsieur Trissotin, her homme
d's esprit y

'^ With this great lawsuit pending, too!
A suit which, if you gain it, will leave
that sweet-looking creature, her daughter
(every one speaks so well of that pretty,
gentle Bianca), little better than a beggar!
Why, it would be like the story of one of
the Montecchi in the house of the Capulet,

in times of old. Think of that dismal
tragedy ! And, then, our uncle the cardinal,
what would he say? Think of
him'

There are no tragedies now-a-days,
Beatrice — at least none of the Eomeo and
Giulietta description ; they have left off
happening : and as to our dearly beloved
uncle, he is a man of peace, and also —
with reverence be it spoken — a man of
contrivance. Leave his Eminence to me.
Go I shall; and I'll wager the antique
gem that you were wishing for the other
day — do you remember? — the Psyche —
against your doves, that I bring home the
prize. I see," continued he gaily, " that
you think my verses are too good to please
that fantastical assembly; and, perhaps,
you are right. But, good or bad, they
will answer my purpose ; and you shall
confess yourself that my wager is won."
So saying, the light-hearted cavalier

nodded to his sister, and departed,
carolling, as he went, the refrain of his
own song, ^^ Floating away on wine."

Five minutes saw him prancing on his
mettled barb, a fiery roan, whose gay curvets
and sudden bounds showed to great
advantage his noble owner's horsemanship;
for the young Conte Alberti was, by common
reputation, as well as in the estimate
of his fond sister, reckoned amongst the
most accomplished cavaliers of Florence ;
and a very short space of time found him
passing through the Lung 'Arno, on his
way to his splendid home in the Piazza del
Grandpa, regarding with the indifference
of an accustomed eye and a preoccupied
mind, the spacious, yet tranquil town,
whose size, compared with its population,
and whose fortified palaces, are so striking
to strangers; as well as the magnificent
groups in bronze and marble, mere copies
of which enrich the museums of other

nations, whilst the originals are the familiar
and out-door treasures of the city of the
Medici.

Little thought our friend Giovanni, passing
them at full-speed on his full-blooded
barb, of palace or of statue ; and as Kettle,
some few hours after, when pacing in the
twilight the church of Santa Croce, did he
heed, even while looking them in the face,
the monuments of Galileo, of Machiavelli,
or of him who wore so nobly the triple
crown of Art — the sculptor, painter, architect,
Michael Angelo Buonarotti. His
thoughts were on other matters.

^^Ay, there is the good father safe
enough until he be wanted, I warrant him,"
cried he, gazing complacently upon a round,
rosy, good-humoured brother of the order
of St. Francis, drowsily ensconced beside
a dimly-lighted shrine. ^^PerBacco! the
Monte Pulciano hath done its good office.
Look, if he have not fallen asleep over his

beads ! A comfortable nap to thee, Father
Paolo ! Stay there till I come to rouse
thee !" And off danced the mercurial
conte, murmuring his old burden, '' Floating
away, floating away, floating away on
wine !"

A blue-stocking party loses nothing of
its proverbial dulness in the marble halls of
Italy ; and the assembly gathered together
in the Marchesa's magnificent saloon —
that is to say, that very important part of
such an assembly, the listeners, were
roused from a state of drowsihood, scarcely
inferior to that of Father Paolo, by the
unexpected entrance of the young heir of
the Alberti in the palace of the Eiccardi.

It was a most animating sensation.
The appearance of a Montagu amongst the
festivities of the Capulet was nothing toit.
The commerce of flattery (for the important
business of the evening had not
yet begun) suddenly ceased; and the

foundress of these classical amusements, a
fade and faded lady, emulous of her of the
golden violet, who sat on a fauteuil,
slightly elevated, with the laurel-wreath
on its crimson velvet cushion, laid upon a
small table of rich mosaic, before her, and
two starched and withered dames of the
noble houses of Mozzi and Gemini at her
side, stopped short in the middle of a compliment,
with which, as in duty bound,
she was repaying the adulation of one of
the competitors for the prize, and started
between horror and astonishment, as if she
had been confronted by an apparition.

Our modern Eomeo, however, was not a
man to be unbounded by the amazement
of a great lady, or awe-stricken by her
displeasure. He advanced with a mixture
of gaiety and gallantry, an assured yet
winning grace, which, for the moment at
least, the stately marchesa found irresistible,
and professing himself an humble

aspirant at the court of the Muses, come todo
homage to their fair representative, took
his station at the back of her chair, and
listened with smiling attention to the competitors

It was, perhaps, the very worst period
of Italian literature ; before Alfieri had
come in his might to renew the old
strength and power of the sweetest of
modern languages; and when the versifiers
of the day, " the word-catchers, who lived
on syllables," confined themselves to mere
verbal quiddities, and the most feeble and
trivial imitations of the worst parts — the
only parts that such mimics can hope to
catch — of the great poets of a preceding
age.

Signer Eicci, a lean, yellow, shrivelled
anatomy, began the recitations with squeaking
forth a canzone to Angelina, all bristling
with concerts after the manner, as he
was pleased to say, of Petrarch ; and was

followed by a wild, sallow, pseudo enthusiast,
who declaimed, with astounding vociferation
and gesticulation, an unfinished
and seemingly interminable dream, in the
involved and difficult triple rhyme which,
beauty and sublimity apart, was, in the
matter of obscurity, pretty truly what it
professed to be — a Fragment in imitation
of Dante.

For " flickering lights, to no one focus brought,
And mirage mists still baffling thirsty thought,
And night-mare phantasies from drowsy grot,
And far similitudes that liken not."

Rhymed Plea for Tolerance.

Signor Puzzi beat Signor Eicci all to nothing.
And accordingly he gratified to
the highest point the bad taste of this
coterie of Italian precious ; and in the
midst of trappings of fans and <sound>murmurs</sound>
of admiration of this grand effort of their
chosen bard, the Monsieur Trissotin of
Florence, our friend Giovanni gently stole

off to a <sound>quiet</sound> corner, near the door, where
sat a sweet-looking little maiden, whose
black eyes sparkled with innocent pleasure,
and whose rosy lips curled into irrepressible
smiles at his approach. She made room for
him beside her, with a natural simplicity
and artlessness that formed a strange contrast
with the affectation and minauderie of
the rest of the assembly.

^^ So, you are a poet, Conte Alberti ? "
said she, in a low voice.

*^ To be sure I am," replied he, gaily ;
anything that will bring me to you."

Really a poet ?" asked the lady.

Why, that is putting my modesty to
a very severe test," said the gentleman.
Really a poet? Who may dare answer
that question in the affirmative ? Judge
for yourself. Come out into the porch,

d Antonio shall bring his guitar, and
I'll sing the words to his accompaniment.
You have heard such a serenade before.
Don't you remember our old signal ? —

The moon is abroad in her glory to-night,
Mid the deep blue sky and the cloudlets white ;
Gaily her beams pierce the vine's trellised shade;
Softly they sleep on the long colonnade ;
Calm her path in the heavens, though the bright

orb below
Still trembles and heaves to the dark river's flow.

All lovely things are around us to-night ;

The rose with her perfume, the moon with her light;'

and so forth. TMs song is worth a
thousand of that. To be sure," added
he, <sound>laughing</sound>, " that is not saying much
for it. But these stanzas are really
good. Only come, and hear''
You'll win the prize then ?"
"I have laid a wager with Beatrice
that I carry the prize home to her,
in spite of them all ; and it will be
your fault if I lose. Only come out
into the porch; I can't sing here. Besides,
I have something important to
say to you. I want you to help me
sto get rid of our weary lawsuit. Would

not you like to put an end to this unnatural
strife, and live with Beatrice asa
sister and friend ?"

*say, from the bottom of my heart,
would I, Conte Alberti ! '' said Bianca,
clasping her hands fervently. "From
the very bottom of my heart ! And with
you, too," added she, with great simplicity.


*' Come with me now then, and I
will shew you how it may be managed.
I beseech you, come."

Oh, Giovanni, I cannot ; I must
not ! We shall be missed. See, Signer
Puzzi has finished, and they are going
to call for your poem."

' Heaven forfend ! " cried Giovanni. " !Neo !
the danger's past. Young Carol is
going to declaim a drama a Vimprovvista,
What subject do they give him? The
Judgment of Solomon, by Jove ! The
Judgment of Solomon ! ! ! !Now, will he

turn the marchesa into the Queen of
Sheba, and go flattering on for two
good hours, at the very least. They
are safe enough now. Come, fairest
Bianca ! Dearest Bianca, come ! "

"Well, Beatrice," said Giovanni, ashe
led his pretty wife to his delighted
sister, "is not my wager fairly won?
The cardinal suggested this catastrophe
to our story; not indeed the means. —
Cospetto ! they would never have entered
his Eminence's brains; but he
said, a year or two ago — that is to say,
he intimated — that if the heir male on
one side married the heiress on the other,
he, the aforesaid heir male, would have
nobody to go to law with but himself. I
had not then seen my little Bianca,
and therefore I turned a deaf ear to
his hints. But after I had seen hers
and loved her, the charmer ! — why then

if it had been necessary, to gain admittance,
that I should have constructed
as vile a canzone as Signer Eicci, —
and have dreamed as detestable a dream
as Signer Puzzi, — and dramatised the
Judgment of Solomon into the bargain,
I'd have done it. We have sent a
dutiful billet to the marchesa, and I
have no doubt but, for joy at getting
rid of the lawsuit, and out of compliment
to my poetical genius, she will
behave like a reasonable woman — the
more especially as what is done cannot
be undone, and all the anger in
the world will not mend it. So now, my
fairest Beatrice, you have nothing todo
but to set her the good example
of bearing misfortune with philosophy,
and pay me my wager. The doves \
signora, the doves!"

"The gorgeous East, with richest hand,
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold.'

Milton.

It was somewhere in the last quarter of
the last century, that Charles Pemberton,
the younger son of an ancient but impoverished
family, having committed the
old-fashioned folly of marrying a young
lady, for no better qualifications than
beauty, sense, and goodness, without regard
to those worldly considerations which
modern prudence deems indispensable,
esteemed himself most fortunate to inherit,
through the bequest of a distant relative,

^ 1

a small estate in the Island of Ceylon ; and
to obtain a commission in a Dutch regiment
serving in that colony, in which, in
the course of fourteen or fifteen years, he
attained the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Living chiefly upon his own property,
about a mile from the beautiful village of
^Negumbo, amongst some of the finest
scenery of Ceylon (which the inhabitants
imagine to have been the abode of our first
parents, the paradise of the old world);
enjoying an elegant competence, and, all-sufficient
to each other. Colonel and Mrs.
Pemberton would have considered themselves
blessed beyond the ordinary lot of
humanity, in spite of their banishment
fi'om the country they loved so dearly, and
the society they were so well calculated to
adorn, but for the great evil of eastern
climates, the successive deaths of several
promising children. Five fine boys and
girls had they followed to the grave ; and

I 2

the only one who now remained to them
was their little son William, a child remarkable
for his affectionate temper, his
intelligence, and his beauty ; upon whom
both parents doted, more particularly, perhaps,
his mother, whose own health had
been considerably injured by the repeated
trials which her maternal feelings had
undergone.

'No tutor had been provided for Willy,
whom they intended hereafter to send to
England for his education. Meanwhile his
father acted as his instructor, when at
home in the intervals of duty, whilst Mrs.
Pemberton supplied his place in his absence
; but the active, lively boy was much
about in the cinnamon plantation (just
then beginning to be cultivated by the
few British residents on the island), which
were superintended by a Cingalese, called
Yinna, a man of remarkable quickness and
much apparent fidelity ; whilst on longer

excursions lie was put in charge of a superior
domestic servant, a Malay of the
name of Gatura, who, by his pliancy of
manner, and powers of amusement, had
greatly ingratiated himself with his young
master.

So implicit was the colonel's confidence
in these dependents, especially in Yinna —
for there was an occasional expression in
the dark eye of the Malay, which recalled
to recollection the vindictiveness of his
race ; but such was his reliance upon Yinna's
integrity and care, that it came upon
him like no common shock, to find, having
contracted for the sale of some essential
oil of cinnamon (extracted from such fragments
as happen to be broken off in packing
up the bales), and having seen it actually
measured and ready for delivery, that half-a-dozen
bottles of this valuable oil, which
sometimes sells as high as ten pounds British
a pint, were missing ; and that, upon

subjecting all concerned to an examination,
two of the very peculiar bottles, in
which the oil had been contained, were
found in a corner of Yinna's hut, behind
the earthen vessels used for cooking rice ;
whilst another was hidden between the
brass basin and the pestle and mortar,
where the spices are pounded, upon the
bench which surrounded the apartment,
and formed, with the articles which we
have enumerated, nearly the whole of its
simple furniture. The bottles were not
merely distinguishable by their fabric and
shape ; but the strong aroma of the precious
commodity, and even a few drops
left in the bottom, proved that they had
been secretly and hastily emptied of their
contents; and that Yinna, the trusted
superintendent of this valuable manufactory,
was himself the thief.

After one simple but earnest denial of
the charge — a denial to which his master

made no other reply than pointing to the
concealed bottles — the delinquent attempted
no farther defence, but resigned
himself tranquilly to whatever punishment
the laws might decree. That extremity
was, however, averted by the intercession
of Willy, whose urgent entreaty for pardon
for his friend was so far complied with,
that Colonel Pemberton contented himself
with dismissing the favourite servant, who
had set so flagrant an example of dishonesty
to the labourers under his charge.
Eemember," said his master impressively,
when paying the wages due to him
and discharging him from his service,
^^Eemember,that I have abstained from punishing
you at the earnest solicitations of this
child; but that if ever you again come
before me for any act of theft or fraud, the
chastisement will be exemplary." Yinna
listened in <sound>silent</sound> submission, kissed the
sku't of Willy's garment, and departed.

For a while the boy missed his kind and
pleasant face in the cinnamon plantations
and about the home-grounds ; but the
griefs of childhood are enviably brief, and
he had nearly forgotten his old playfellow,
when he was thrown unexpectedly in his
way, many months afterwards, in a visit
paid by himself and his father, attended by
Gatura, to the pearl-fishery at Condatchy.

A gay and pleasant scene was this pearl-fishery.
Thousands of persons, of all colours
and nations, in the picturesque costumes of
the East, from the rich travelling merchant
who supply the great jewellers of our
European cities, to the poorest of the
Cingalese women and children, who hover
around the sieves, and pore for days over
the heaps of sand which have been thrown
aside, in the hopes of lighting upon the
smallest seedling pearl, crowd the streets
of the temporary town (at other times a
mere fishing village), washing, sifting,

boring, drilling, squabbling, and bargaining,
in every variety of dialect and jargon ;
all intent upon the beautiful luxury destined
to add a costlier splendour to the
monarch's crown, or a rarer charm to the
brow of beauty.

Willy was delighted ; all the more delighted
that he met his old friend Vienna,
and that Yinna had been singularly
prosperous. A speculating merchant had
not only engaged divers on his own account,
but had employed persons to examine
the sand that had been thrown by,
after passing, or being supposed to pass,
through the sieves. Vinna had been fortunate
enough to discover, in a portion
which must have been spilled before being
subjected to that process, a pear-shaped
pearl of such size and beauty, as had not
been found off the coast of Ceylon within
the memory of the oldest trader connected
with the fishery. An agent of the King

of Candy, specially despatched by his
royal master for the purpose of obtaining
such a jewel, to gratify a fancy expressed
by his favourite ^yife, who wanted such an
one to complete a set of ornaments, was at
that moment treating for it with his employer.
Yinna ran to procure it to show
to the boy, and placed it on a crimson
shawl to display the shape and colour to
the best advantage. At Willy's entreaty,
Colonel Pemberton also advanced to admire
the treasure, attended by Gatura,
who had accompanied them to Condatchy ;
and a little crowd of merchants and natives
gathered round the place, enlarging upon
its merits, marvelling at Yinna' s good
fortune, or rather the extraordinary luck
of his employer, and wondering how, by
any degree of carelessness, a pearl of such
magnitude could have escaped from the
sieves.

Whilst these assistants, in the heat of

their discussion, stood divided into separate
groups, and Colonel Pemberton, at
Willy's entreaty, was speaking with a
grave and measured kindness to Yinna,
his employer and the agent of the King
of Candy having concluded their bargain,
returned for the pearl. They applied to
Yinna, who motioned to the shawl which
he had deposited on the top of a high
covered basket close behind him. The
basket was there, and the shawl ; but the
pearl was gone ! The consternation was
general. Yinna wrung his hands in agony ;
the buyer and seller of the precious commodity
were in equal dismay. Every
man looked suspiciously on his fellow.
Some disclaimed ; some accused. Gatura,
who had stood nearest the basket upon
which the valuable jewel had been so unhappily
left, insisted so vehemently upon
being searched, that, rather to pacify him
and rid themselves of his clamour', than

from any positive mistrust, his dress and
person were, as he desired, subjected to a
very rigorous examination; nothing, of
course, being found that could implicate
him any way in the delinquency.

In the meantime, the less successful adventurers,
who had before been loud in
the expression of their astonishment that
such a pearl could be found in such a
manner, began to gather round Colonel
Pemberton, to examine into the character
which Yinna, whom they understood, from
what had passed between them, to have
been heretofore employed by him, had
borne while in his service. The agent of
the King of Candy, the purchaser of the
pearl, and the speculator who had sold it,
also approached with the same view.
Willy, who, child as he was, saw the turn
that matters were about to take, seized
the opportunity to steal towards his friend.

Go, Vinna ! go ! " said Willy ; and,

vdth. a sudden start, and a momentary
pause, Yinna obeyed the injunction. He
disappeared among the crowd ; and, by the
time that the questions of those interested
had extracted from Colonel Pemberton the
cause of his dismissal, and that two or
three of the most determined called out to
arrest him, he had made such good use of
his time, as completely to baffle every
effort of his pursuers : his flight, whilst it
saved him from almost inevitable punishment,
producing upon everybody, except
Willy, who did battle manfully in his behalf,
the most complete conviction of his
guilt. It seemed as certain that he had
stolen the pearl, — perhaps, that he had
twice stolen it, — as that he had stolen the
oil of cinnamon. No one believed in the
possibility of his innocence, except our
friend Willy.

The father and son returned to Gumbo
; and, in a little while, the colonel was

called away on service ; and, Mrs. Pemberton
being in delicate health, Willy was
left much to the care of Gatura, who spared
no pains in his endeavour to win the favour
of the lively and spirited boy. He constructed
a pad, on which to take him before
him on a blood horse, belonging to the
colonel, and carried him every day upon
some excursion to the cocoa groves (or
topes), or the dreary forests which surrounded
their habitation. One day, he
took him to see the manner in which wild
elephants are caught; and Willy was
delighted with the sagacity and affection
displayed by one of the tame ones, who,
apparently recognising an old companion
in the largest of those that had been
ensnared, actually opened the fastenings
of the gate for the release of his friend;
thus shewing, although enslaved himself,
iiis sense of the value of freedom. Willy
was enchanted ; and, on Gatura's dwelling

capon the grandeur and interest of a buffalo
hunt, never ceased importuning the Malay
to afford him that gratification.

One fine morning, accordingly, they set
forth professedly to witness this remarkable
spectacle. The high-bred steed carried
them rapidly through the cocoa tope, into
the very depth of the forest. Xo sign
appeared of the hunters ; but, pleased with
the beauty of the scenery, the golden rays
of the sun darting through the shaddock
and the tamarind, and resting on the
beautiful fruit of the jamboe, and amused
by the variety of bright coloured birds
and gorgeous butterflies, the boy took no
note of the distance. At last, as the day
advanced, the claims began to be felt, and
he intimated to Gatura his desire to return
home.

^^ Home ! " said the Malay, in the low
accent of bitter hate; "you never shall
.return. Do you remember the day — you,

child as you are, may forget ; but on my
memory that day is burnt in characters of
fire — when, for striking this horse, ay, it
was this very horse, as Colonel Pemberton,
my master, your father, was pleased to
think over hard, he snatched the whip
from my hand, and struck me, ay, lashed
me with it, as if I had been a beast ? I
grasped the crease in my bosom ; but that
would have been a brief and common
vengeance. I have waited for such
revenge as may endure; and now my
hour is come. You, too, young sir! you
were pleased to read out of some story-book
to your mother that pearls might
be hidden in the mouth; that stripping
the dress, and searching the person, was
no security against a skilful thief ! Home
shall you never come to tell your father
that tale, unless, indeed, you can win your
way through the beasts and reptiles, the
snakes, and the panthers of this forests

Down with you, sir ! Do not cling around
me in this manner ! Let go my sash, or
I will cut away those little hands ! What
<sound>noise</sound> is that ? Off with you, I say ! "

And, frightened at some real or imaginary
<sound>noise</sound>, Gatura dashed the struggling
child to the earth, and rode rapidly away,
leaving in the boy's hands the shawl sash,
by which he had clung so tightly, and
which had been folded, after the oriental
fashion, round the waist of the Malay. A
small packet dropped from it — it was the
lost pearl !

Hungry and bewildered as he was, the
stout hearted boy lost neither his courage
nor his presence of mind. He pocketed
the precious jewel, plucked the unripe
fruits to appease the cravings of appetite,
and tried, with all his might, to retrace
the way by which he had come, and to
turn back to his home ; but, far beyond
his own knowledge, he only plunged deeper

yoL n. K

and deeper in the forest. He avoided,
however, with remarkable boldness and
sagacity, the frequent dangers from snakes
and wild animals, took vestige under a
talipot-tree from a storm, which sent the
<sound>shrieking</sound> flor-mouse to the same friendly-shelter;
and at night, remembering that
the Cingalese sometimes constructed their
habitations for security on the branches of
trees, he climbed the tallest trunks that he
could meet with to sleep.

What was the agony of the bereaved
mother during that long and solitary
night ! Gatura had not returned, and,
wholly unsuspicious of his treachery, she
imagined that some fatal accident had
happened to him and to his charge. Messenger
after messenger did she despatch in
every direction; Colonel Pemberton was
recalled ; and every means taken that the
most anxious affection could dictate, to recover
the missing child.

He, meanwhile, wandered on, subsisting
on wild fruits by day, and sleeping in
trees by night, until he had nearly reached
the boundaries of Candy. He too, poor
child, was heart-sick and home-sick. The
high courage which he inherited from his
father, animated him at the approach of
danger; but at other moments, footsore,
weary, bruised by falls, and torn by bushes,
this spirits flagged, and his strength was
exhausted. One day, as he was passing
by some brushwood, which half concealed
the entrance to a low cavern, a furious
buffalo came bellowing up a track in the
forest, and, pausing for an instant, lowered
his head to attack the child. Another moment,
and Willy would have been gored
by his horns, or tossed into the air ; buta
man rushed from the cavern, and, seizing
the child with one arm, with the other
flung a piece of cloth (part of his own garments)
over the head of the buffalo, blind

2

ing him, and entangling Ms horns, so that
the boy and his preserver had time to retreat
into the cave, the entrance to which
was too low to admit the enraged animal.
Willy was saved; and turning to thank
the friend to whose boldness and address
he owed his life, he <sound>burst</sound> into tears of
delight, <sound>clapped</sound> his little hands together,
and shouted '' Vinna ! dear Yinna !"

Three days after this, Yinna, bending in
respectful salutation, with his arms folded
upon his bosom, stood in the presence of
the beautiful wife of the Canadian king. She
listened to his little story, and listened
pityingly, for she was a woman and a mother.
She promised, with the grace of conscious
power, and nobly did she redeem
her promise, to redress all Yinna' s grievances,
whether as regarded the oil of cinnamon,
which she justly suspected Gatura
to have stolen, or the lost pearl ; and with

regard to that pearl of pearls, the noble boy
Willy, she made it her first business, her
first pleasure, to send him home to his distracted
parents, laden with presents, and
accompanied by his brave preserver, the
faithful Cingalese.

*' This love will undo us all." — Shakspeare.

One of the shortest and dreariest days
in January was drawing to a close. Snow
had fallen some days previously, and
glared upon the roofs of the houses in the
picturesque and irregular old to^vn of
Belford Eegis, and lay mixed with ice, and
trodden into a sort of wintry dust upon
the highway. Snow, too, was visibly hanging
in the grey and gloomy sky, waiting

only for milder weather — for the hour
when the soft south-west should steal upon
the black north-east — to come down in a
world of white feathery flakes, and cover
the earth with its bright, level, uniform
beauty.

The streets, although not yet lighted,
were almost deserted of carriages and passengers
— except, indeed, the well-wrapt
little boys and girls, tripping rapidly
home from school, with cheeks almost as
red as their red comforters; and the
noisier and merrier troop of happy, ill-clad
urchins, who came frisking and <sound>shouting</sound>
from the pond at the top of the hill, the
great pond opposite the Queen's head,
where they had been keeping the cold at
bay, by sliding and tumbling upon the
ice, and pelting each other with snowballs,
making, as it were, a playmate of the
frost ; and, excepting also careful servant-maids,
wending, with cautious speed, over

the slippery pavement, laden with smoking
dishes from the bake-houses ; or hurrying
pot-boys, or slower milkmen, <sound>rattling</sound> their
jingling commodities against the icy steps
of the doors, or the iron railing of the
areas.

In a word, it was at the close of a winer's
day, that, the morning influx of
customers having intermitted, the shorten
and apprentices of Mr. Morris, the greatest
haberdasher of Belford, had retired to
warm their fingers in their own apartment
I. — preferring the bright ^e of the open
grate to the smoky heat of the stove —
after returning to their shelves, nicely
folded up, the numerous articles taken
down to gratify the fastidiousness or the
caprice of lady-purchasers, for men, to do
them justice, seldom do give this sort of
trouble ; leaving in the dusky range of
show-rooms, rendered tenfold more gloomy
by the waving draperies which darkened

the windows, and swayed to and fro in
the dim twilight, only two individuals —
a respectable-looking elderly man, who,
mounted upon a high stool, was seated at
a very business-looking railed-in desk, employed
in writing, by the light of a single
taper, in an equally business-like, tall,
thick book, bound in calfskin ; and a
young man, particularly well-looking and
gentlemanly, whose likeness to the former
sufficiently marked their relationship, and
who stood at his side, pretending to be
occupied in arranging a drawer of rich
satin ribbons, which he was rolling and
unrolling, and doing unconsciously his
very best to spoil, in the eagerness of his
appeal to his father's feelings.

"Yes, sir, it is but too true — and a
thousand times she has urged the fact
upon me — that poor Elizabeth is only a
servant maid in the family of our good
rector, Mr. Sumner. A servant she certainly

is, but a most honoured and trusted
one. Mrs. Sumner was so struck by her
intelligence and sweetness, above a dozen
years ago, amongst the girls at the Green
School, that she took her home to her own
house partly to attend and partly to play
with her elder children. She shared their
advantages of education — not indeed the
accomplishments which were unfitted for
her station, but those better and rarer advantages
which regard the cultivation of
the mind, and the formation of the character
; and Mr. Sumner's opinion of her
has been sufficiently proved, by his having,
since the death of his excellent wife, and
the marriage of his eldest daughter, committed
the direction of his house and of
his two younger children unreservedly to
her charge. A servant she is, but one
accustomed to the management of a large
family, to the keeping of the most exact
and elaborate accounts, to the prudent and

careful expenditure of money — to everything,
in short, that is most desirable in a
tradesman's wife. I speak now merely ina
worldly point of view, and say nothing
of the beauty, the sweetness, the grace,
and the modesty which makes her an
object of admiration wherever she appears."


"She has no money'' replied Mr. Morris,
suspending for a moment his pen over the
book in which he had been apparently
most sedulously engaged in making various
entries during his son's harangue. " She
has no money."

*' Then her taste and skill in female
apparel. You know, sii', how often you
have said that, if my poor sisters had lived,
you would have added millinery and dressmaking
to your business, and converted
some part of our large premises up stairs
into show-rooms. How often I have heard
you say, that one branch of trade helped

the other; and that our opposite neighbour,
Mr. Welsh, would not be able to keep his
shop open against us, if it were not for his
wife's caps and bonnets. I^ow, Elizabeth's
taste and Mr. Sumner's connexion"

" She has no money, Edward, — she has
no money."

!Neither had she, sir, two years ago,
when, in consequence of Master Arthur's
rashly venturing upon ice too weak to bear
his weight, I had the first happiness of
being of use to her and her young charge.
Mine is no love of yesterday; no concealed
or clandestine attachment. We have met
openly at the institution lectures ; have
walked together on summer evenings.
Mr. Sumner, without any verbal recognition
of our engagement, has yet often,
after church on a Sunday, virtually sanctioned
it, by smiling, and significant invitations
to accompany Elizabeth and the
children to his house; nay, even you yourself,

by your maimer of speaking to her
and of her, have led me to believe that you
considered her as a daughter. You are too
keen an observer, too kind and careful a
father, not to have seen the state of my
affections; and I had thought you too wise
and too liberal, to set a little paltry money
in competition with the happiness of a
whole life, or to wish me to break my
plighted troth to one whom I dearly love —
to one who loves me — and marry I know
not whom, for the sake of adding needless
pelf to our already flourishing fortunes.
I had thought your only son was dearer
to you than money. But I was mistaken
you hold my honour and my happiness
at no higher price than this gaud'' And
he threw from him in bitterness of spirit
the roll of ribbon which he had been so
busily folding and unfolding.

The pen dropped from the father's hand.
You are mistaken, Edward," said hein

a low voice, which was interrupted fora
moment by a <sound>sound</sound> well known to the
inhabitants of Belford — the deep hoarse
<sound>cry</sound> of '' Shoes ! old shoes ! — shoes ! old
shoes !" from beneath the window.

" You are mistaken, my dear son, not
in my feelings, but in my circumstances.
The fortunes of the poor half-starved wretch
who is calling ^ shoes' through the wintry
snow, are more flourishing than mine.
Without your aid I am a bankrupt."

Another hoarse deep <sound>cry</sound> of '' Shoes ! old
shoes ! — shoes to buy ! shoes to sell ! —
shoes ! old shoes !" gave to the agitated
father the pause which his feelings required.
His son was too much absorbed in
astonishment and horror for speech; he
could only listen in silent agony to a story
which seemed to him rather like a frightful
dream than a stem and waking reality.
Mr. Morris continued: —

** You were too young when your blessed

mother died, to remember her distinctly ;
and her poor sisters, gentle and amiable as
they were, inherited rather her delicacy of
constitution than her vigour of mind. Far
above me in birth, in education, and in
cultivation, she was left destitute at the
age of seventeen, by the improvidence and
the sudden death of her father, a beneficed
clergyman ; and I owed the blessing of her
hand chiefly to her desire to procure for her
twin brother a home and a protector. Before
our marriage, she made me promise to
treat William Arno as my own younger
brother, as my own eldest son ; to be to
him as a friend, a guardian, a father ; and
of this most solemn promise she requested
the renewal upon her deathbed. Heaven
and you, my son, pardon me if I have kept
it but too faithfully ! Let me make short
work of this wretched matter. I placed
him as clerk in a banking house in the
city, where, as you know, he rose to be



cashier. I and another friend of my family I

were his securities, and all seemed fair and j

prosperous. Three months ago, he came

to me in an agony of guilt and despair, i

He had been speculating in the share j

i
market. He had embezzled a large sum ]

belonging to the firm, and, unless it were ^
replaced by a certain day, his liberty, his
character, his life — for never, he swore, {
would he survive the loss of reputation — ^
were destroyed. Could I hesitate ? Even {
had I abandoned him to his fate, I was
equally ruined, since the house would have
come upon me and upon the Mend who,
at my pressing instance, had joined me as
his bondsman, to indemnify them for their j
loss. The sum was, to a man in my station, |
enormous, exceeding, by some thousands,
the earnings and savings of the five-and-twenty
years that I have passed in business.
The deficiency was, however, raised
for me, within the stipulated time, by our

friendly solicitor, Mr. Byrne, who happened
to have, at the moment, a client,
willing to lend the money upon my personal
security, and this house, with the stock
and furniture. I gave him a bill of sale
on all my effects; and was considering
whether or not to break the matter to you,
or to go on upon credit, and leave the result
to time, when Mr. Byrne made me,
two days ago, a most unexpected overture,
from the friends of a yoimg person with
a portion of £l",000, who, although informed
of my difficulties, was yet willing
to marry her to you, willing to pay off the
debt, requiring nothing but a settlement of
the rest of the money, and such an arrangement
as to partnership, as I should have
been, inter any circumstances, but too
happy to enter into. I have not seen her
I do not even know her name ; but she
is, they tell me, young, well-educated, and
VOL II. L

amiable, a thoroughly good and exemplary
girl."

Oh, my father, do with me as you
like ! But, yet, Elizabeth ! — dear, dear
Elizabeth !"

^^ You would rather, then, be poor and
happy with her whom you love. So be it,
my dear son. Go to your Elizabeth. See
if she be willing to share your poverty ;
willing to wait until some prospect may
arise, that should in some sort, authorize
your union. The unhappy man whose imprudence
has been our ruin, spoke of one
whose defalcation had ruined him, and who
might, who probably would hereafter make
good the sums for which he was engaged.
He has repeated this expectation in a letter
which I received from him last week. But
that hope is too vague to build upon. See
Elizabeth. Disclose to her, unreservedly,
the position of affair's — I feel that, with her

the confidence will be sacred — and then act
as you see good. Put me out of the question.
I am still strong and healthy, and
capable of earning my bread as a shop-mans''


^^ father ! never ! never !" interrupted
Edward, with a sharp and sudden revulsion
of feeling. '' Even if I vere so undutiful,
so unnatural, she would not consent ;
I know she would not. Often and often
has she said that she felt that our marriage
would never take place ; that it never ought
to take place ; that your son, the son of
the most respectable tradesman in Belford,
ought not to be united to a poor girl from
a charity school. And, now that that union
can only be accomplished by depriving
you of your home, by sending you in your
old ago to serve as a hireling — oh, she
would never hear of it — would never bear
the thought !''

Go to Elizabeth," repeated Mr. Morris,

L 2

in a smothered voice, pressing his son's
hands between his, with an energy that
betokened the struggle of his feelings —
*' Go and consult with your Elizabeth''
And, as the shorten and apprentices came
flocking in, and the lighted gas gave a
glittering brilliancy to the rich and gaily
decorated shop, radiant with shawls, and
silks, and ribbons, of a hundred varied hues
and a group of customers, gay country
ladies, who wished to choose an evening
dress by candlelight, appeared at the door
he escaped into the street, with an instinctive
desire for solitude, and, almost
unconsciously, took the road to St. Michael's
rectory.

The lamps in the streets and shops were
now burning, and showed with a most
striking effect of light and shadow, the
fantastic outline of the picturesque old
town — the tops of the houses covered
"with snow, the icicles hanging from the

eaves, and the windows already covered
with icy frost-work. The pavement was
again alive with passengers — men and
women hurrying to the Post-office ; flies
and carriages gliding, with a sort of dull,
<sound>rumbling</sound> <sound>sound</sound>, along the snowy road ; a
stage-coach emptying itself of its freezing
passengers at the Eed Lion ; a man with
periwinkles, and a woman with hot chesnuts,
each so muffled, the man in a frieze
cloak, and the woman in a dreadnought
coat, that it would have puzzled an (Oedipus
to decide betwixt the he and the she; one
little girl lingering longingly in the wake
of the periwinkles; two great boys burning
their fingers in a bold attempt to filch the
burning chesnuts; other children <sound>rushing</sound>
aimlessly along, <sound>shouting</sound> and bellowing
as if to scare the cold. Men were <sound>thumping</sound>
their feet upon the ground, and buffeting
their chest with their arms to restore the
circulation ; women were chattering, dogs

<sound>barking</sound>, beggars begging, fiddles <sound>scraping</sound>,
bells <sound>ringing</sound>, <sound>knockers</sound> tat-tat-tat-ing — sin
short, all the <sound>noises</sound> of a win ry evening,
in a country town, were in full activity.

From the High Bridge, where the broad,
bright river, with its double line of wharfs
and houses, crowded with people, its boats
and its barges, forms so gay and pretty a
moving picture, so full of bustle, and colour
of light and of life — from the High Bridge,
the Bennett now showed like a mirror,
reflecting on its icy surface, with a peculiar
broad and bluish shine, the arch of
lamps surmounting the graceful airy
bridge, and the twinkling lights that
glanced, here and there, from boat, or
barge, or wharf, or from some uncurtained
window that overhung the river.

The snow lay in drifts upon either shore,
marking the long perspective, and glanced
upon the suburban cottages and the distant
country, edging into the gentle uplands,

Hardly deserving the name of hills, that
closed the prospect, strongly relieved, at
the present moment, by the dark and
dusky sky. In spite of his distress and
pre-occupied. mi ad, poor Edward, who had,
probably without knowing it, much of
those two rare gifts, the poet's feeling and
the painter's eye, could not help stopping
a moment, on the centre of the bridge, to
contemplate so fine an effect of chiar'oscuro^
60 striking and beautiful a picture, composed
almost without colour, by the nice
contrast of light and shade.

"While he stood admiring the scene, he
was overtaken by the old man whom he
had heard, a short while previously, <sound>crying</sound>
shoes ! shoes !" under the window of his
father's shop; and whom he had passed
just before, whilst engaged in chaffering
for some of his commodities with an orange-woman,
whose barrow was stationed at
the end of the bridge.

The itinerant shoe-merchant was, as I
have said, well-known to the inhabitants
of Belford by the name of Old Isaac;
and, from his name, his calling, his keenness
at a bargain, as well as from his quick,
black eye, aquiline nose, and a greater
proportion of beard than is usually suffered
in this good kingdom of England to
adorn a Christian countenance, was com-^
only reputed to be a Jew. He was a
spare old man, of the middle height, somewhat
stooping, but with a picturesque and
richly coloured head, surmounted by an
old slouched hat. His patched and faded
garments were well-nigh hidden by two
enormous bags, in which he carried the
old shoes which he bought, and the new
ones, or soi-disantiiew — for he was a great-man
at a rifacimentOy and had the art to
'' gar auld shoon look mast as guide 's the
new " — which he sold.

Buy a pair of warm slippers, master.

i

this cold night," quoth Isaac. '' Wedding
slippers, fine enough for a lord."

Nothing, this evening," said Edward.

'' Have 'em a bargain, master," persisted
the man of shoes.

I am not in want of any," rejoined
Edward, moving on.

'' Wedding shoes, then ? — wedding
boots ? Must buy somewhat," continued
the vender, pertinaciously keeping up with
our friend's rapid steps, and thrusting
before his eyes the articles which he
named.

" I tell you that I want neither wedding
slippers, nor wedding shoes, nor any
of your commodities," answered Edward,
With some humour, endeavouring to
escape from his pursuer.

^^ Don't ye!" exclaimed Isaac, with a
knowing twinkle of his keen black eye.
Don't ye ! Well, then, buy for the want
that's to come. I've set my heart upon

having a bit of a deal with ye to-night,
and shan't mind bating a penny or two,
rather than balk my fancy. You shall
have 'em under prime cost," continued
Isaac, coaxingly ; " you shall have 'em for
next to nothing. Do ye have 'em ! We
must have a deal. You'll see that you'll
be married sooner than you think for.
Your time's coming. So you may as well
buy the wedding slippers at once. "What
do you bid for 'em ? Make an offer."

'Not a farthing, Jew. I am in haste.
You need not untie the bag. You have
nothing that I would take if you would
give it me. Let me pass on. I am not
going to be married. I want nothing of
you."

^^ Don't be too sure of that, Master
Edward Morris. You and I may come to
a deal yet. Jew, quotha ! No more a
Jew than yourself. If your eyes were not
turned another way, you might see me in

the aisle of St. Michael's Church every
Sunday morning and afternoon, as regular
as yourself. Jew ! 'Tis an extraordinary
compliment you idle folk pay to that
tramping race, that, whenever you meet a
body who takes care of the main chance,
and turns an honest penny, you call him
a Jew. Well, Master Edward, you'll see
that you'll come to me for your wedding
slippers." And, so saying, Isaac shouldered
his bag again, and left the path free.
At another moment, Edward would have
smiled at the old man's acute observation
of the direction of his glances in church,
and at his persevering endeavour to attract
a customer, founded upon that observation
; but his thoughts were too painfully
divided between his father and his mistress
— his duty and his love ; and, during
his rapid walk to St. Michael's rectory, he
could only resolve to be guided in all
things by the judgment and the feeling of
Elizabeth.

156 WEDDING SLIPPERS. ]

She received her lover with the gentle j
self-possession, the calm and serious sweet |
ness, which characterised her maimer, and ]
which had been partly, perhaps, the cause, ;
partly the result of the confidence placed ^
in her by Mr. Sumner. His father had,
to suit his purpose, forced himself to ad ;
vert to her situation and her origin in his
conversation with his son; but Edward
felt proudly that there was no trace of the
charity school or of the servants' hall in |
the lovely woman who stood before him,
with a simple and unaffected propriety — • '
in a higher rank it would have been termed
dignity — that would have beseemed a !
palace. His distress was immediately |
visible to her, and her anxious inquiries j
served to introduce his story. ]

"We must part, Edward; as to that |
there can be neither doubt nor question," ^
said she, in a low, steady voice, whilst the
tears trembled on the long fringes of her
large black eyes, and the rich colour went

f

and came on the finely-turned cheeks and
lips, which a sculptor would have been
proud to model. " We must part. I
have always known that it would be so —
always felt, without suspecting or dreaming
of this obstacle, that Mr. Morris would
find an insuperable objection to receiving
me into his family. I ought, perhaps,
knowing that, to have forbidden your
visits. But I was encouraged in my
attachment by one whom I am bound to
obey, and by whose orders I have acted in
this business ; and my own feelings led me
but too readily into the error. Oh, if it
were only for ourselves, this poverty would
be nothing ! Young, active, accustomed
to exertion, it would be delightful to labour
with you and for you — delightful to feel
that there was no superiority on your side,
except that of your respectable connexions,
and your manly and vigorous character.
But your father — your kind and excellent

father! — to tear him from his home, to
send him in his old age to serve as an
hireling — he, so long accustomed to respect
and consideration! — to banish him from
his friends, his neighbours, his native
town ! We must not think of it. The
sacrifice must be made. And you will
find your happiness, dear Edward — we
shall find our happiness — in his restored
comfort, and in the consciousness of
having done our duty."

Affectionate son as Edward was, and
determined as he had professed himself to
abide by the decision of his mistress, he
could not refrain from combating this resolution.
She listened to him with sweet
and mournful attention, as if willing to
hear all that he had to say ; but her determination
was unshaken. She had just
asked —

'' Since we must part, dearest Edward,
were it not wiser to shorten this pain''

when an odd-looking little note was delivered
to her.

Elizabeth read the contents once, twice,
thrice, and remained <sound>silent</sound> and perplexed j
as if hardly comprehending the meaning.

"It is very strange!" exclaimed she,
thinking <sound>aloud</sound>, and forgetting that she
was not alone; "very strange! What
can he want at this hour ?''

He !" exclaimed Edward, jealous (so
strange a thing is a lover's heart) of hex
whom he was upon the very point of resigning.
" He ! — what he ? From whom
comes that note ?"

From one who must be apprised of
this event''

Not, surely, fi*om Mr. Sumner? No;
from him it cannot be. Eut from whom ?
Who can have the power so to absorb your
attention at such a moment?"

Elizabeth paused an instant, and then
said, gently — " Come with me, and you

shall know. Although we are doomed to
part, to meet no more, you must always
be amongst the most valued, the most
cherished of my friends. I cannot afford
to lose your good opinion. Come with
me, and you shall know all."

She tied on her bonnet, wrapped herself
in a large cloak, and they passed through
the rectory garden into the churchyard.
The fine old Gothic building, with its grey
cloisters, its graceful porch, its towers, and
its steeple, rose in sombre grandeur from
the graveyard, covered with snow, by
which it was surrounded, the summit almost
lost in the frosty mists of the air; so
that the imagination added to the actual
height, gave a cathedral-like grandeur to
the edifice. A few yews and cypresses
were clustered in one corner, and a row of
stately limes, their larger limbs partially
covered with snow, which lay in long intersecting
lines, defining the forms of the

branches, led to an iron gate, which opened
into a narrow lane, leading to one of the
poorest and least populous suburbs of the
tovNTi. Along this lane Elizabeth passed,
sedulously attended by Edward.

" I ought to have told you before," said
she, in a low voice — ^^ only he whom it
most concerns forbade the disclosure, and
Mr. Sumner, I hardly know why, coincided
in his desire — that, although a charity girl,
I am not, as you have thought, an orphan.
I have a father, a most fond and affectionate
father, one whom I love dearly,
and who dearly loves me. He is a poor
but industrious man, following a mean occupation
; not so poor but that he makes
me frequent presents, and is most kind and
generous to the widow in whose cottage
he lives, and whom he mainly supports.
Still, I have always felt that he was not fit
to be your father, nor to be connected so
closely with a man so intelligent, so well-educated,
and so respectable in station as

VOL II M

Mr. Moms. I always felt that something
would prevent our union. And so, alas !
it has turned out."

By this time the clouds had so far
cleared away as to admit glimpses of a
keen and frosty moon, which shed a cold,
pale, desolate light upon every object ;
dwelling with tenfold desolation on a small
hovel, whose lagged thatch and windows
stuffed with ra2:s, as well as the broken-down
state of the little gate, (ajar perforce,
since, hanging by one hinge, it would
neither shut nor open,) which led into the
narrow front court, betokened the most
sordid poverty.

Up this court Elizabeth passed ; and,
<sound>knocking</sound>, with, as it seemed, a forced
resolution, at a low door, in little better
condition than the gate which formed the
outer barricade, was immediately admitted
by an infirm old woman into a dark and
dismal kitchen.

*^ I look for your father every minute.

Miss Betsy," quoth the tottering crone,
' for 'tis past his time o' coining in ; and,
if ye'll wait till I strike a light, ye may
walk into his room, and I'll kindle ve a
bit o' fire ; for you tender lasses, that live
in grand houses, can't bear the cold like
us poor folk that be used to nothing
better."

And, so saying, she fumbled out an old
tinder-box, and having, with some difficulty,
cherished a spark into a flame — for
her old and withered hand, and feeble
<sound>breath</sound>, seemed numbed and chilled by the
cold which she defied so manfully — she
lighted a wretched candle, led the way
into the next apartment — and endeavoured,
with a little damp straw, and a
few dirty chips, that had evidently been
long trodden under foot in some carpenter's
yard, to produce, in a small rusty grate,
from which the brickwork was breaking
away, something as nearly approaching to

M 2

a blaze as the state of the fireplace and
the nature of the fuel would allow.

Edward, in the meanwhile, took a
mournful survey of the sordid abode, contrasting
so strongly with the appearance,
the mind, and the manners of the lovely
and graceful woman who stood beside him,
the beloved of his heart. The hearth and
its appointments — the bit of old iron that
served as a poker, the broken dustpan that
officiated as shovel, the pipkin upon two
legs, and the lipless pint cup which did
duty as kettle, pot, and saucepan — this
niggard and beggarly hearth was but a
type of the rugged and scanty perishing
of the comfortless chamber. A joint stool,
a rickety table, and two tumble-down
chairs, one of them garnished with a
cushion, darned, patched, and mended,
until mending was no longer possible,
figured in the centre of the uneven, bricked
floor ; over the chimney, was a mug without

a handle, a teapot curtailed of its fair
proportions by the loss of half a spout, a
teacup and saucer of different patterns,
and two or three plates and basins, all
more or less cracked, and repaired, not
very artistically, with putty and white
paint. In one corner was the inmate's
humble bed — a chaff mattress, with one or
two rugs or horse-cloths, much the worse
for wear ; in another, the little pile of
straw, and chips, and rotten sticks, from
whence the fuel now smoking rather than
burning in the chimney had been selected ;
and, in a third, a dingy heap of old shoes.

The old woman, satisfied with her labour,
retired to her part of the dwelling.
Elizabeth was the first to break the pause
which succeeded her departure.

This, Edward, is the abode of my
father — of a father whom, in spite of all that
surrounds us, I have good cause to love.
Does not the sight of such misery serve to

reconcile you to the destiny that parts ns ?
Such, at least, is the effect which it ought
to have — which it has on me. I am not
fit to belong to your family. [Never should
I have cherished such a thought. Strange
that Mr. Sumner, knowing as he did the
whole truth, should have encouraged our
attachment ! Strange, most strange, that,
till now, the name and the existence of my
father should have remained a secret!
Well ! my presumption is fitly punished,
and you will turn with a freer heart to
one more worthy to share your home and
possess your affections."

'' Say not so, my own Elizabeth ! Were
it not for my paramount duty to my own
most kind and excellent father, all that I
see here would but supply a fresh motive
for our union. All speaks of poverty and
industry — nothing of crime. And, next to
the joy of offering you a comfortable home,
should I reckon that of rescuing one so

near and dear to you from penury and toil.
Oh. ! that I were now the free agent that
I thought myself yesterday ! Not another
night should your father spend beneath
this roof. If my wretched uncle,
Arnott, could but know the misery that his
wild spirit of speculation has brought upon
us all ! "

^^ If he could, Master Edward, I am
minded that he'd rather cry old shoes than
gamble in the share market," quoth
our friend Isaac, advancing into the room ;
depositing, with considerable care, his two
bags of shoes in their appropriate corner,
and emptying, with equal readiness, divers
rotten sticks, fir apples, and stumps of
gorse, gathered during his day's travel —
for apparently he had wended countryman
from the several pockets of his nondescript
garments. " If these Stock-Exchange
gamblers could but tell the sore hearts
they cause to their friends and kindred,

mayhap it might go nigh to reform 'em'
pursued Isaac. " So here you be, Master
Edward, come to make a deal, as I prophesied
; and ye ha' brought Bess wi' ye, to
clinch the bargain. So much the better.
Gie me a kiss, Bess. So thou best come
to help Master Edward to choose his wedding
slippers — eh, my girl'' And the
old man nodded his head, with a knowing
wink, and <sound>chuckled</sound> — " Come to choose
the wedding slippers ! "

Alas, my dear father, you little know,"
began Elizabeth.

^^ Alack and alack, wench ! 'No blacks
for me. I do know all the story ; ay, and
a great deal besides, that neither of you
know, wise as ye think yourselves. Come,
my good boy and girl, sit ye down
here by the fire. Bess looks as white as
the snow on the house-top ; and thou.
Master Edward, art not much better. Sit
down, and make yourselves comfortable.

I'll tell you aU about it." And the old
shoe-merchant drew his two chairs to
either side of his little fire, seated himself
upon a stool in the middle, flung on fresh
fuel, breaking the sticks with his withered
hands, and did the honours of his small
apartment with much hospitality. " Well,
Master Morris, for all I cry old shoes about
the streets, and my Bess (heaven bless her
sweet face ! ) was brought up at a charity
school, it ain't altogether for want of a bit
of money. Many a year have I been
scraping and scraping, and hoarding and
hoarding, to save her a portion ; and I
told her and Mr. Sumner not to let out
that she had a father, just for the pleasure
of the surprise like. So, in the meantime,
comes this affair of Master Arnott. Ay,
better cry old shoes than go gambling in
shares. So I happened to have the money,
waiting for a good security — nothing like
turning an honest penny — just when Master

Byrne was wanting it for your father.
So I lets him have it. Here's the paper,
see — what-d'ye-eall't ? — the bill of sale.
And I offered him my girl, with £15,000
to her portion ; not letting out who she
was. And here I've just got a letter from
him to Master Byrne, saying as how
'twill break your heart to marry her ; not
thinking, mind, that she's she. And I
repose as how you are come to say that
you won't have her, 'cause o' your father —
eh ? So she's refused o' both hands — eh,
Bess ? Well ! I love a good father, and I
love a good son ; he'll be sure to make a
good husband. And, if Bess don't make
thee a good wife, my lad, there's no faith
in woman. So take her ! — and take this
bit o' paper ; that's ten thousand pounds :
and there's five thousand that I promised,"
continued he, going to one of his corner
heaps, and taking a couple of dirty banknotes
out of an old shoe, ^^ and another that

I give, 'cause of these two refusals. A good
father makes a good son, and a good son
'11 make a good husband. And I've heard
to-day, from a real Jew, who knows a good
deal of what goes on on 'Change, that
Master Arnott is likely to get his money
back again. So now off wi' ye to Master
Morris, and tell him the news. And, harkye,
my boy, don't forget to come back for
the Wedding Slippers ! '

It is a poison tempered by himself." ■

Shakspeare.

^^ Nay, I know that the Stormy Petrel
is as pretty a boat, and manned by as ;
stout a crew, as ever sailed among the |
green islands of the Carib Sea, or coasted j
the bays and headlands of the main ; but i
a man's heart is made of flesh, Senor !
Captain, albeit it sail under the black ;
flag, and even your wild sea rovers may i

not be able to resist the smooth tongue of
this varlet. It is a soft spoken youth, I
tell thee. Give him three inches of cold
steel as soon as he boards thee, and fling
him off into the waves. The deep sea tells
no tales."

*^ As thou wilt!" returned the Buccaneer,
with a slight curl of his thin lip,
and a glance, from whose strange mixture
of gaiety and scorn the haughty Spaniard
involuntarily shrunk. *^ As thou wilt ! I
had destined his ghost to the honour of
guarding my own private hoard, buried
in the sand on an island that shall be
nameless. Eut 'tis easy to carry off some
captive for that purpose, for he must be
slain on the spot, observe, to be ready for
the performance of his duty."

And now, so far as looks might go, the
Planter's scornful sneer, — for he understood
rightly, that however glossed over
by levity, the superstition was a real

feeling, — retorted the ill-dissembled contempt
of the Pirate Captain.

Since thou mistnistest the tender
mercy of my dare-devils, Black Juan of
Cales with his stiletto, or the Bohemian
giant Brandt, with his boar spear, shall
put him out of pain or ever he sets foot
on the deck of the Stormy Petrel. The
stab shall come before the fear. But how
are we to make prize of him, Senor Don
Pedro ? Thou wouldst not have me send
a boat's crew to carry him off bodily from
thine own plantation ! I see that the
little boat is still at the cove by the
creek : — Canst thou not deliver him thyself
into our hands ?''

*^ Not for all the silver of Mexico !
Donna Gonsalva already misdoubt that
I love not her favourite page. She knows

too . 'No, good Grease," continued

Don Pedro, checking himself; ** I must
not be seen in this matter. I must despatch

Antonio to the Petrel in the little
boat, an hour or two before sunset, whilst
I myself remain at San Isidro, and in full
sight of my whole household. He will
come alone. Contrive to return the boat
to its moorings ; and hark ye, thou hast
flags of all nations — hoist the red cross
of St. George at the mast-head as soon
as the deed be done. He will come alone,
and without token. There is thy warrant,"
added the Spaniard, taking a heavy purse
from his girdle, and tossing it to the
pirate ; " there is thy warrant. And now,
the sooner we put land and sea between
us, the safer for both."

** Coward !" thought the bold sea rover,
as each turned to pursue his separate way. ,
*^ Insolent coward ! the red cross of St.
George, the ensign of England, to announce
a deed like this ! The craven is
liberal, however," muttered he to himself,
poising the purse of doubloons, after a

moment's pause. '^ Fear is a special paymaster.
Well, his job shall be done ; my
trusty mate, Miles Bertrand, shall manage
it, whilst I row stealthily to my own
little desert island, and add this gold to
my secret hoard. Miles knows no Spanish,
so that pleading and remonstrance will
stead the poor wretch naught; and, in
good sooth, that rugged mate of ours will
have no more remorse in striking down
the solitary boatman than I have in crushing
this beetle. 'Tis a foul deed, after all ;
but yon craven Spaniard must answer it."

Thus mused the Captain of the Stormy
Petrel, as he strode with hasty <sound>steps</sound> towards
the shore. The half-expressed
thoughts of his late companion, as he bent
his way inland, were not a jot more flattering.


'' Ruffian !" — so ran his soliloquy —
scoffing, mercenary ruffian, and artful as
mercenary; for had I consented to accompany

Antonio, who shall say how the
visit might have ended ? And yet'' continued
he, more calmly, ''of such tools
doth a wise man make the instruments
that shape his fortunes. To be fairly rid
of this young Antonio, now too, that, if I
read her rightly, Gonsalva hath discovered
all; and now that the speedy
arrival of the Governor at Vera Cruz will
take my fairest cousin from my ward,
robbing me at one stroke of beauty and of
wealth, of living and of love ! Why, it is
such a necessity that, if the Pirate had demanded
a statue of pure gold to guard his
island treasure, the robber must have had it.
Well, I have only now to find Senor Antonio,
despatch him on some feigned errand
to the Petrel, and be careful to keep in
view of the whole household until vespers
be past. I marvel if the masts of the
schooner be visible from the portico of San
Isidro, or whether I must ascend the roof.

VOL II. N

The red cross flag will glitter afar. I
must make good speed to find Antonio."
And quickening his pace, he hastened
silently towards the plantation.

The spot where these two worthies had
held discourse of life and death, deliberately
plotting the murder of an unoffending
and innocent fellow-creature, was one
of the most beautiful on the beautiful
shores of Spanish America. A clear and
sparkling rivulet gushed from the foot of
a tall rock, overhung by the luxuriant and
splendid creepers of the tropics, a grove of
feathery palms yielded their long foliage
to the sway of the western gale, mingling
their <sound>murmur</sound> with the pleasant <sound>sound</sound> of
running waters, and adding by their delicious
shade to the perpetual freshness
and verdure of the grassy margin of the
spring. Flowers of every hue hung from
the grey crag and the lofty palm trees, or
enamelled the turfs ground, whilst birds

and insects, gorgeous as flowers, flitted
from blossom to blossom, or basked in the
fervid beams of noon. How could evil
thoughts and evil deeds spring into life in
such a scene !

A few hours had passed away since the
interview which I have attempted to describe,
and now the evening sun shone
upon herb, and flower, and flowering tree,
illumining with a diamond-like radiance
the clear waters of the fountain, and bathing
in a flood of light the lovely creature
who stood upon its brink. She was
gazing upon a miniature which she held
in her hand, gazing so intently, that she
started to hear her own name, although
the speaker in following her thither did
but obey her mandate.

Donna Gonsalva !" said the page.

Antonio !" responded his fair mistress ;
Antonio, are we alone ? Art thou sure
that we are alone — that none can see or

N 2

hear us — above all, that my stem and
haughty cousin, my servant, as he calls
himself, — my master, for so I have long
felt him to be, — is at safe distance?
Dangerous were it, past all danger, if he
should hear that which I have to tell.
Where is Don Pedro, Antonio ?"

''I left him whiting even now at the
house, dear lady. He hath sent me on an
errand to the trader in the roadstead, to
bring from the vessel certain rich stuJQfe,
which he would, he said, have rowed
ashore himself, had he not been engaged
preparing letters for Madrid. He enjoined
me to use despatch, and I should be
already in a little boat, had not Nez conveyed
to me your command to meet you
here. You tremble, dearest lady; your
colour comes and goes. Is their aught in
which the poor Antonio can stead his sweet
mistress ? Hath any man dared to grieve
you ?"

"say, dear Antonio, this emotion
springs from joy, not grief. I weep I
know not why. Dost thou recognize this
picture ?"

Full surely. It is the portrait of my
honoured lord, your noble father."

And dost thou remember, children as
we were, how he sent for us to stand
beside his dying bed, and kissed and
blessed us, and bade us love each other ?
Oh, thou dost, thou dost — I see thou
dost ! None knew thy parentage. Thou
wast called an orphan — a poor orphan;
and Don Pedro, when he took possession
of this rich plantation of San Isidro, calling
himself my guardian, and claiming me as
his destined bride, would fain have sent
thee to a monastery, to college, to the
army — anywhere away from me ; but our
childish love was proof against threat or
artifice. We would not be parted, and
you remained at San Isidro as my page —
mine own dear and loving page. Oh, Antonio

! our love was an instinct. Prepare
for a strange happiness. Looking
to-day at this portrait, given to me on his
death-bed by my father, I touched a
spring, the back flew open and discovered
a letter. Prepare thyself for happiness
incredible, for joy past all joy, my Antonio
! That letter — thou know'st that
my mother died in the hour that I was
born — that letter told of a secret marriage,
during a brief sojourn immediately after
her death in the country of his ancestors ;
a marriage to one of humbler fortunes, the
daughter of a soldier of old Spain. She,
too, gave birth to a child, and shortly after
died. Antonio, dear Antonio ! canst thou
not guess the rest ? Thou art that child
my brother, dear Antonio 1 the rightful
heir of San Isidro. My brother — Oh,
what joy is in the name 1 Mine own
dear brother ! Wilt thou not speak tome,
Antonio?

'' Gonsalva, sweetest sister V^ — and the

happy brother and sister were locked in
each other's arms.

We must be cautious for a short space,
dear brother I" said Gonsalva, raising herself
at length from Antonio's tearful embrace.
'^ We must be cautious awhile, or
our grasping kinsman, who, as our father's
heir male, and as my guardian and destined
husband, has hitherto enjoyed the revenues
of this princely estate, would
scruple no artifice to retain it. I tremble
lest my emotion at the discovery may have
awakened his suspicions. Our calmness
must quiet them. We shall not long need
to dissimulate. Our powerful kinsman,
the Conte Almeida, is already on his way
to Vera Cruz, We will put these letters
into his hands the moment of his arrival.
His authority, as governor, will be absolute.
There will be no difficulty in
proving the marriage. Father Ignatius,
of the Dominicans of Seville, performed

the ceremony. I tell thee, Antonio, thou
shalt be recognized as heir of San Isidro !
as mine own dear brother ! How proud
I am of the name ! and now, away with
thee ! We must not awaken suspicion, —
'till tomorrow, farewell."

^^ Farewell, then, sweetest sister ! Sweetest
and most beloved? What grief it is to
leave thee even for one night ! Most beloved
and most generous Gonsalva, ."


Generous ! — say selfish, dear Antonio*
Wilt thou not save me from a hated marriage?
Am I not rich in a thrice-dear brother?
Generous, indeed! but this is no
time for chiding. Thou must away ; hasten
to perform thine errand ; delay no longer."
And they parted.

The fair Gonsalva, full of a generous and
overflowing contentment, took the shortest
path towards the plantation ; while Antonio,
scarcely recovered from the bewildering

joy and astonishment of her communications,
obeyed half mechanically the wave
of the hand by which she had indicated
that his way led to the sea-shore.

The sudden and impressive sense of happiness,
so perfect and so exquisite, seemed,
like some enchanting dream, too bright to
last. That he, the poor and homeless
orphan, the child of charity, with no friend
save his dear lady, should be the son of
honourable parents ; the brother of that
sweet and gracious creature, — privileged
to love and protect her, — to forestall her
every wish, — to make for her such sacrifices
as she had joyfully made for him, —
to prove himself worthy of the blood of
which he sprung — worthy to wield the
knightly sword of his fathers ! — such
thoughts swelled his heart almost to bursting.
He longed to pour out his whole
soul in prayer and thanksgiving ; and suddenly
pausing as he wound among the
rocks, he saw just above him a stone cross,

shining brightly in the last rays of the
setting sun, and struck into an upward
path which led to a small chapel on the
top of the cliff, built and endowed by his
father Don Rodrigo Hernandez, partly ingratitude
to the Virgin for an escape from
shipwreck, and partly to serve as a beacon
on that dangerous coast. Beneath was the
shallow cavern in which Don Pedro's boat
lay moored ; and so close as to be within
hail fi'om the shore was the Stormy Petrel,
the Pirate vessel.

Prostrate before the shrine of the Virgin
Mother, absorbed in prayer and pious meditation,
Antonio found the spirit-calm
which he wanted. Time had passed by
unnoted ; and he was roused from his devotions
by a rapid <sound>step</sound> below.

"ISo signal !" muttered Don Pedro, ashe
loosened the boat from its moorings.
No red-cross flag ! He must have reached
the schooner long ago. Hath the pirate

villain played me false ? Shall I hail him?
No ; — I'll row to the ship and learn the
truth at once."

By the time Antonio had descended the
steep and rugged pathway that led from
the chapel to the shore, Don Pedro, putting
his whole strength to the oars, had reached
the vessel. Apparently he was expected
there. The Stormy Petrel lay defined in
strong relief against the bright but transient
glow of a tropical sunset. Two
figures stood at the gangway, and as the
Spaniard mounted the ship's side, a boar
spear and a stiletto entered his body. The
horror-stricken page saw the steel gleam,
and heard the heavy plunge as the corpse
dropped into the reddening wave. The

murderer had fallen by his own engine.
This even handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips."

Note. — The leading incident of Schiller's beautiful
ballad of Fridolin, a good deal altered, will be recognised
in this story. Ah ! those great Poets who lived
before us — they stole all our best ideas.

k

Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid —
Some banished lover." — Pope.

Tap ! went a modest, timid, shy-sounding
<sound>knock</sound> against the old-fashioned oaken door
of William Marshall's domicile, in the
brief twilight of a September evening —
the hour of all others in which a pretty-young
woman might, with the least risk of
observation, pay a visit to a handsome
bachelor — the best hour to shield her from

the attacks of village gossip, or to cover
her own confusion, should her errand be
such as to challenge something like a jest
on the part of her host.

Tap ! tap ! again went the slender forefinger
; but although the reiterated summons
was a thought louder than the first
nearly inaudible demand for admittance,
it was equally unsuccessful in arousing
the attention of the master of the dwelling.

Eor this abstraction there was a reason
which the young and tender-hearted will
admit to be valid : the poor youth was in
love, and to enhance that calamity he had
quarrelled with the mistress of his affections.


William Marshall, at the time of which
I write, schoolmaster of Aberleigh, the
only son of one of the poorest widows in
the parish, was a person of great merit.
Some quickness and much industry had
given him a degree of information and refinement

unusual in his station, and his
excellent conduct and character had secured
the friends whom his talents had
attracted. In short, he was one of those
instances — more frequent than the grumblers
of the world are willing to admit —
which prove that even in this life desert is
pretty certain to meet its reward.

The ancient pedagogue of the village, a
man of some learning, who availed himself
of the large and airy schoolhouse to
add boarders aspiring to the accomplishments
of mathematics and the classics, to
the sturdy country lads, whom, by the will
of the founder, he was bound to instruct
in reading and writing, declared that this
his darling scholar caught up, untaught
and unfledged, all that he painfully endeavoured
to instil, by book and birch,
into the fortunate pupils whose fathers
were rich enough to pay for teaching and
whipping ; and he followed up this declaration

not only by installing him, at the
early age of seventeen, into the post of his
assistant, but by recommending him so
warmly to the trustees as his successor, that
at his death, which occurred about six years
after, "William Marshall, in spite of his
youth, was unanimously elected to fill the
place of his old master, and took possession
of the pretty house upon School Green,
with its two noble elms in front; as well as
of the large garden, orchard, and meadow,
which the brook, after crossing the green,
and being in turn crossed by the road and
the old ivied bridge, went cranking round
so merrily, clear, bright, and rapid as ever
rolled rivulet.

Now this, besides its pleasantness as a
residence, formed a position which, considering
the difference of the age and
times, might be reckoned, for our modest
scholar, full as good as the magnificent
proffer of the green gown, cow's grass, and

four marks a-year, made by the good
Abbot Boniface to Albert Glendinning,*
and by the said Albert Glendinning, to
the unspeakable astonishment and scandal
of the assistants, unceremoniously rejected;
since, in addition to the stipend paid regularly
as quarter-day came round, and the
prospect of as many boarders as the house
would hold, was the probable contingency
of the tax-gathering and rate collecting,
the timber-valuing and land-measuring,
which usually fall to the share of the
schoolmaster ; together with the reversion
of the office of parish-clerk, provided
always, that for a " master of scholars, "f
who taught Latin and Greek and took
boarders, such office were not held infra
dig,

William Marshall's humble wishes were

f " A scholar, sir ! I was a master of scholars." —
Lingo, in the disagreeable Surprise'"

gratified. He was a happy man ; for, in
addition to the comfort of having a respectable
home for the infirm mother to
whom he had always been a most exemplary
son, he had the gratification (so at
least said the gossips of Aberleigh) of
preparing a suitable abode for one of the
best and prettiest of the village maidens.

Ever since the days of Pyramus and
Thisbe, proximity has been known for the
friend of love ; and such was probably the
case in the present instance, since Lucy
Wilmot, the object of William Marshall's
passion, was his next neighbour, the brook
of which we have made honourable mention
being the sole barrier by which her
father's meadows were divided from the
garden and orchard of the school.

A more beautiful boundary was never
seen than that clear babbling stream,
which went wandering in and out, at " its
own sweet will," with such infinite variety

of margin : now fringed with alders, now
tufted with hawthorn and hazel, now
rising into a steep bank crowned with a
giant oak flinging its broad arms across
the waters, the reflection of its rich indented
foliage broken by the frequent
dropping of a smooth acorn from its dimpled
cup ; now sloping gently down into
a verdant bay enamelled with flowers of
all hues, the intensely blue forget-me-not
half hidden under the light yellow clusters
of the cross-leaved bedstraw, while the
purple spikes of the willow-herb waved
amidst the golden chalices of the loosestrife,
and large patches of the feathery
meadow-sweet, the heliotrope of the fields,
spread its almond-like fragrance and its
pale and feathery beauty to the very centre
of the stream, overhanging the snowy
blossoms of the water-lily as they rose from
their deep green leaves, and mingling with
that most remarkable of the many sedges

that border our English rivers, whose
flowers, placed so regularly on either side
of their tall stalks, resemble balls of ebony
thickly set with ivory spikes. Certainly,
of all possible methods of dividing or
uniting persons and property, this bright
and cheerful stream seemed the most propitious
to social intercourse, as William
and Lucy found by experience.

The green in front of the schoolhouse
formed a commodious natural playground
for the children, sufficiently near for safety,
and yet wide enough for all their sports,
the noble game of • cricket included : so
that those sharp little eyes which love so
dearly to pry into the weaknesses of their
elders, especially when those elders assume
the double relation of ruler and preceptor,
were, during the intervals of tuition, happily
engaged elsewhere; and really nobody,
except perhaps a lover, would believe
how attentive William Marshall became to



the COW which was tethered in the orchard,
how punctual in culling himself all the
fruit and vegetables needed from the garden,
how assiduous, above all, in watering
his mother's little flower-pot sloping down
to the stream ; whilst on her part it was
at least equally remarkable how often
Lucy Wilmot found cause to fill her pail
at the brook, or to feed the ducks, geese,
chickens, and turkeys, which she had dislodged
from their old home, the farm-yard,
to establish by the water side. !Never was
poultry so zealously looked after. It happened
to be a dry summer ; and it stands
upon record at the Brook Farm that Lucy
volunteered to fetch all the water wanted
for domestic use by the whole family.
To be sure," as her sisters would <sound>laughingly</sound>
observe, " they had sometimes to
wait for it, especially if it were towards
dinner-time, or before breakfast, or after
school broke up." And then Lucy would

blush, and declare that she would never go
near the place again ; and then, by way of
keeping her word, she would take up her
little basket of barley, and run across the
meadow to feed her chickens.

Halcyon days were these. What a
charming spot for a rural flirtation was
that mirror-like stream ! What tender
words floated across it ! What smiles and
blushes looked brightly down into the
bright waters ! And of how many of the
small gifts, the graceful homages in which
love delights, was that clear brook the
witness ! From the earliest violet to the
latest rose, from the first blushing cherry
to the Katherine pear, rich and ruddy as
Lucy's own round healthful cheek, not an
offering escaped the assiduity of the devoted
lover. Halcyon days were these to
our friend William, when an affliction befel
him in the very scene of his happiness — a
shadow fell across the sunshine of his love,

SO hideous and gloomy as to darken his
whole future prospects, to sadden and embitter
his very life. Like many other
swiffc and sudden poisons, nothing could be
more innocent in appearance than this implement
of mischief, which wore the <sound>quiet</sound>
and unoffending form of an unopened letter.


Hovering one day by the side of the
stream, waiting with a basket of filberts,
'brown as the squirrel whose teeth crack
them," as Fletcher has it — filberts firm,
juicy, and fragrant, the first of season
awaiting until the close of evening
should bring his Lucy to tend her poultry
under the great oak — she saw a letter on
the grass, and springing from bank to
bank on a spot a little higher up, where
the brook was sufficiently narrow to admit
of this sort of lover's leap, he stooped for
the paper, suspecting, sooth to say, that it
might be some billet-doux of his own, with

the design of returning it to the fair owner.
His it was not. On the contrary, the
epistle was sealed with a pretty device of
doves drinking from the same shallow
bowl — an imitation of the exquisite doves
of the Vatican — which he himself had
given to Lucy, his first pledge of love, and
directed in her well-known hand to
Mr. Willatts,

at the Eed Boot,

Bristol Street,
Belford.
Well did William Marshall know this Mr.
Willatts ! Well did he know and heartily
did he despise this dandy of the Eed Boot,
who — slim, civil, and simpering, all rings
and chains, smirks and grimaces, curls and
essences — skipped about in his secondhand
coxcombry, as if the vending of earthly
boots and shoes were too gross for so
ethereal a personage, and glass-slipper
maker to Cinderella were his fitting designation

! William always had disliked him,
in virtue of the strong antipathy which
opposite holds to opposite ; and now to
see a letter to him directed by Lucy, — this
Lucy — sealed too with that seal ! '' But
she would explain it ! of course she would !
she must, she should explain what motive
she could have for writing to such a creature
as that, after confessing her love for
him, after all had been arranged between
her father and himself, and everything was
prepared for their marriage before the
ensuing Christmas. He had a right to
demand an explanation, and ought not to
be content with any thing short of the
most ample and satisfactory account of the
whole matter."

Just as he had worked himself up to the
very climax of angry suspicion, his fair
mistress, with her eyes cast down upon the
grass, evidently in search of the lost letter,
advanced slowly towards the spot. She

started when she saw him, and when he
presented the epistle, with a greeting in
the true spirit of the above soliloquy, in
which a stern and peremptory demand for
explanation was mingled with an ironical
and contemptuous congratulation upon the
correspondent whom she had chosen, her
answer, between confusion at the discovery,
indignation at the j jealousy so openly avowed,
and astonishment at the high tone taken by
one who had hitherto shown nothing but
the gentlest tenderness, displayed so much
displeasure, vexation, and embarrassment,
that the dialogue grew rapidly into a quarrel,
and ended in a formal separation between
the lovers. Each party returned
home angry and grieved. William most
angry, if we may judge from his sending
the unlucky filberts, basket and all, floating
down the stream ; Lucy most grieved,
if the crumpled letter and defaced address
so nearly washed out by her tears that it



required all the skill and experience of the \
Belford postmaster to decipher the legend, j
may be accepted as evidence. ;

In spite, however, of this token of her '
fond relenting, the first tidings that i
"William Marshall heard of Lucy, were !
that she had gone on a visit to her god I
mother, twenty miles off. William, on his
part, staid at home instructing his pupils i
as well as he could. In spite of lovers'
quarrels the work of the world goes on. ]
To be sure the poor boys wondered why '■
their master, usually so even-tempered, ;
was so difficult to satisfy; and his fond I
mother could not comprehend why, when
she spoke to him, her son, always so ^
mindful of his only remaining parent, |
answered at cross purposes. Eut William, \
although a lover, was a strong-minded
man; and before a week had elapsed he
had discovered his own infirmity, and had j
determined to correct it. Accordingly he

opened his desk, took out the map of an
estate which he had just finished measuring
before the unlucky adventure of the
hero of the Eed Boot, and having compared
his own mensuration of the different fields
with the estimated extent, and completed
the necessary calculations, had just relapsed
into a reverie, when the interruption
occurred which formed the beginning
of our little story.

Tap ! tap ! tap ! <sound>sounded</sound> once again, and
this time a little impatiently. Tap ! tap !
tap!

*'Ah, my good cousin Kate'' said
William, at last admitting the poor damsel
who had waited this unmerciful while at
the door, of which detention our lover had,
one hardly knows how, a glimmering consciousness
: "I hope you have not been
long detained ! "Why did not you knock
louder ? Do you want my mother ? 'No ;
or you would not have come to the door

of my little room. You want me, Kate, I
see. So tell me at once what I can do for
you''

And smiling, blushing, and hesitating,
Kate confessed '^ that she did want her
cousin William ; that she had a letter

(William started and winced at the

very <sound>sound</sound>) — '^ a letter to write ; and she
was such a poor scholar, and the friend
who used to write her letters was away ;
so she had come to trouble cousin
William."

No trouble at all, dear Kate !" replied
William, recovering from 'this confusion,
and too much occupied with the recollections
awakened by the very name of a
letter to observe the embarrassment of his
pretty visitor ; " no trouble at all. Here
is my paper ready. I^ow begin. Is it to
your brother in London ? "

Oh, no !" replied the blushing damsel;
'^ not to my brother : to a friend''

Very well !" said William. '^ The days
draw in so fast that it will soon be dark.
Begin, dear Kate !"

And after a little hesitation, and playing
with a folded letter that she held in her
hand, Kate, in a very low, hesitating voice,
began to dictate : ^^ Dear Francis "

'^ Dear Frances," echoed her amanuensis,
unsuspectingly, in a still lower tone ; then
pausing, and looking up as expecting her
to proceed.

'stop!" said Kate; "only that it is
wrong to give you the trouble to begin
again — but that sounds so formal !''

"I think it does'' replied William,
dashing his pen rapidly through the
words ; and the abbreviation is so pretty
too. "There, continued he ; " Dear
Fanny ! — that sounds as well again !''

'* Fanny !" exclaimed Kate, half <sound>laughing</sound>
in the midst of her blushes. " Fanny,
indeed ! Why, cousin William !" —

And cousin William, awaking immediately
to the perception of the true state of
the case, dashed out the second beginning
as rapidly as he had done the first, and
<sound>laughing</sound> with a very good grace at his
own stupidity, wrote this time, in full
assurance of being right, —

^^ Dear Frank!"

^^ Fanny, forsooth !" repeated Kate, still
<sound>laughing</sound>.

" Well but, Kate, remember that I had
never heard of this friend of yours. To be
sure it was very, very stupid. But now shall
we go on with the letter ? or may I ask
who this Frank " —

^^ Fanny," interposed Kate, archly.

*swell! who this Francis is? Does
my good aunt know, dear Kate ? or " —

'' Oh yes, dear William ! Mother knows
and father knows, and both like him so
much ! Tt has been kept a secret till now,
because his friends are so much better todo

in the world than mine ! for he is a
tradesman, William, going into partnerships
with his late master ; they are so much
richer and grander than father, that we
thought they might not like their eldest
son to marry a poor working girl. But he
said they would only look to good character,
and so they say in this letter, and they
have consented ; and he told them how
you, my own cousin, had got on by your
own good conduct, William, and how
proud he was of knowing you "

" I know him, then !" interrupted
William, with pleased curiosity.

Yes, to be sure ! Don't you remember
our all drinking tea together at Farmer
Wilmot's last Sunday was three weeks ?
Lucy knew it all along."

&lt;* Frank! Frank Willatts?" inquired
William eagerly. " Was it for you, then,
that Lucy wrote that letter ?"

To be sure she did. And were you

208 THE VILLAGE AMANUENSIS. j

jealous of her, William ? And was that j
why she went away ? Oh, William, '
William ! to be jealous of dear, good
Lucy, because she kept my secret ! Oh,
cousin William !"

But William was too happy to be very
penitent, and Kate was too pleased and too
busy to dilate upon his offences. She
had her letter to dictate, and, with a little
help from her willing amanuensis, a very
pretty letter it was ; and so completely
in charity with all the world, especially
with the Franks of the world, was this
amanuensis, that, before he had finished j
Kate's epistle, he had written himself into |
such feelings of good-will towards her
correspondent as to add a most friendly
and cousinly postscript on his own account.

What were the contents of the far more
ardent and eloquent letter which William
Marshall afterwards wrote, and whether
he did or did not obtain his mistress's pardon



for his jealousy, and its fruits, we
leave to the imagination of our fair
readers. We, for our part, knowing the
clemency of the sex, incline to think that
he did.

VOL II.

Mine honour is my life." — Shakspeare



^^ Be waiting soon after dark, my dearest i
Leonora, at the balcony of you' apart |
ment, and when you see me holding np a
torch in the little boat upon the lake, steal
unobserved, if possible, from the castle,
and come to meet me at the water-side.
I must see you ; must pour my sorrows
into your sympathizing bosom; must take
leave of you — possibly for ever !
^^ Your unhappy Brother,

^^ Fernando Juan Carlos de Guzman."

For the twentieth, time, Donna Leonora
read her beloved brother's letter, as she
stood leaning upon the beautifully carved
stone work of the balcony, watching the
appointed signal. Her husband was absent
; and the mystery in the delivery of
the billet had excited the attention of her
serving maidens, Olivia and Ursula, and
had even awakened in their coarser minds,
accustomed to the not unfrequent flirtations
of Spanish beauties, — suspicions that
their grave and high-minded lady, hitherto
so inaccessible and so spotless, was, at
last, about to listen at least to one amongst
her innumerable admirers. The disguise
of the letter bearer, and the <sound>silence</sound> and
secrecy of his own approach, were, so far
as Don Garcia was concerned, wholly unnecessary.
But Donna Leonora, aware of
the untamed — perhaps untameable — impetuosity
of her brother's character (an
only brother, and most fondly beloved),

p 2

and of his impatience of contradiction,
and doubtful, also, how far what she had
to hear might be connected with the political
convulsions of these troubled times,
and certain of her husband's just reliance
upon her affection and prudence, resolved
to obey implicitly Don Fernando's directions,
to wait in the balcony until she
perceived the signal-torch, and then to
hasten to meet him by the edge of the

lake.

As she stood leaning on the carved stonework,
her guitar at her side, the beams of
the full moon striking on her rich jewels
and her commanding beauty, and illumining
the splendid mansion, of which she
was the undisputed mistress (from one of
whose opened windows peeped forth the
inquisitive and <sound>laughing</sound> serving maidens),
the contrast — that contrast so fi-frequent in
this world of contradictions — between the
splendour and gaiety of outward circumstances,

and the cares and anxieties of the
inner mind, the wide difference, in short,
between appearance and reality, was most
strikingly exemplified. To the eye she
was bright, fair, sweet, and <sound>calm</sound>, as the
flowers clustered in. their sculptured vase,
that waved above her head, diffusing
beauty and fragrance around her ; but, as
the flower-leaf is subject to influences from
without, shaken by the night wind, and
battered by the rain, so is that sentient and
delicate blossom, the human heart, liable
to be swayed by the changeful gusts of
passion and feeling ; and, even when in itself
equable and firm, it is but too often
torn and shattered by sympathy with the
sufferings and injuries of the objects of its
best affections. And so it fared with the
gentle Leonora at this moment, when,
awakening from a long reverie, occupied in
vain guesses as to the purport of the letter
which lay by her side, she glanced suddenly

down towards the lake, and saw the
signal-torch gleaming high above the
waters.

In a few minutes the brother and sister
were standing together, in earnest conversation
beneath a group of cedar, and
cypress, and Portugal laurel, through
whose dark foliage the moonbeams struck
in bright fitful gleams, as the cool breeze
of evening swayed the huge branches.

He insulted me, Leonora, before the
whole regiment ; called me a rash, hotheaded
boy; and when I sent the young
Conte de Merit to him, to demand an
apology, or to appoint the time and
weapons for a meeting, he refused to Stentor
him or answer him, otherwise than by
saying that his regard for my father's memory,
his old comrade in arms, alone prevented
him from putting me under arrest
for sending a challenge to my superior
officer ; that for this time he forgave me,

but that I had need look to it, for that the
next breach of discipline should be visited
upon me with all the rigour of military
law. And this from Manuel Hernandez to
a descendant of the house of Guzman •
And he survives, and I surface ! And all
redress is closed against me by military
discipline, forsooth ! Military discipline ! !
Well, I have removed that barrier, have
thrown up my commission ; and if, upon
my return to Madrid, he refuse me the
satisfaction that I require, I will leave
Spain — leave Europe I The world does
not want wages in which the son of an old
Castilian, even if he abandon his estates,
his rank, his country, may win for himself
enough to maintain life, without forfeiting
that without which life is worthless —
honour."

Alas ! my dearest Fernando! my most
dear brother !" exclaimed Donna Leonora,
in the deepest affliction ; " can you speak
thus of leaving your country, of abandoning

the princely name and the princely
home of our ancestors, of deserting now,
in the moment when she most needs the
defence of every loyal cavalier, the young
and innocent sovereign, in the assertion of
whose rights you took so vivid an interest ;
above all, can you think of forsaking me !
True, I have a kind and an honourable
husband ; but even his affection would not
suffice for my happiness, if you, the playmate
of my childhood, the companion and
friend of my maturer years, my dear brother,
my only living relation, were to become
a wanderer and an exile ! Speak to
my husband, Fernando ; he, too, is a soldier,
and a noble Castilian ! Consult him.
What was the commencement of this unlucky
quarrel ? Don Manuel Hernandez
has a lovely daughter, the Donna Seraphina,
respecting whom he is known to be singularly
tenacious. Surely, her name was not
mentioned between ye? "

His daughter, quotha ! '' replied the

fiery youth " I never saw her, have hardly
heard that such a person existed ! Don
Diego Velasquez and myself were speaking
of a stranger, clearly a lady of distinction,
a beauty whom we had met together
on the Prado, and whom I had subsequently
seen, oftener indeed than I cared to tell
him, at early mass at the church of the Holy
Trinity. He dared to compare with this
angel, pure, dignified, gracious, and graceful
; — I have never spoken to her, but I
am sure that she is all this ; there is an
evidence of bearing and of countenance, to
say nothing of the careful attendance of two
old domestics, whose appearance vouches
for the station and the character of their
mistress — he dared to compare with her a
Jewish girl, picked up in some of the
alleys of the city : and it was my indignation
at this insult, offered to a virtuous
lady, which provoked the interference of
Colonel Hernandez, who had entered unobserved

during the dispute. Don Diego
apologised. He is a slight boy ; a trivial
jester, who would crack jokes at his mother's
death-beds or his father's tomb : but
Hernandez ! And to refuse me all explanation
! all redress ! To disgrace me before
my comrades, and then to stand upon his
seniority ! his military discipline ! ^ The
day would come he said** when I should
repent my violence.' Death will arrive
before that day ! Farewell, my Leonora !
Women cannot comprehend these feelings !
Schooled before all his officers ! And he
expects that I shall submit ! that I shall
rejoin the regiment, to be pardoned, it maybe,
or schooled again ! By St. Ago,
the gentleman is modest ! Farewell, my
precious sister! my own Leonora. May
the Holy Virgin watch over you ! Forget
me, my best Leonora; I can never forget
you." And he broke from her affectionate
embrace, leaped into the boat that

awaited him, and rowed rapidly to the opposite
shore ; where Jose, his faithful domestic,
attended with his horses.

The weather was singularly fine even

for that delicious climate. The moon,

«

nearly at full, reigned in the clear and
deep-blue sky like a milder sun, throwing
a silvery light upon the wild and beautiful
scenery, the deep and richly wooded glens,
threaded by mountain streams, and surmounted
by the abrupt precipices and rugged
steeps of the Sierra Guadarrama, into
the defiles of which a few hours' riding
had now brought them. Even the stormy
passions of man were insensibly soothed
by the peaceful sights and the harmonious
<sound>sounds</sound> of nature, the <sound>calm</sound> sweetness of the
night, the <sound>lulling</sound> <sound>sound</sound> of the wind amongst
the willows, and distant fall of waters
gushing from a rock, and the balmy odours
of the costumes, the wild thyme, and the
thousand aromatic herbs that sprang

around him on every side. Unconsciously
his anger was yielding to milder thoughts,
as he wended his way, taking, at the guidance
of Jose, or the will of his steed, the
nearest but least-frequented road to Madrid
; when, on emerging from a grove of
cork-trees, and entering a straight and
narrow valley where the rude cart-track
woimd between tall and almost inaccessible
crags, celebrated as the resort of the banditti,
formed in these times of civil war by
the refuse of either army, he was startled
from his meditations by the <sound>repeated</sound> <sound>sound</sound>
of a pistol-<sound>shot</sound>, and the <sound>shrill</sound> <sound>screams</sound> of
female <sound>voices</sound> ; and saw right before him,
in the moonlight, a carriage drawn by
mules, with one or two unarmed attendants,
who, overpowered by superiority of
numbers, and the suddenness of the attack,
were on the point of surrendering to
half-a-dozen ferocious - looking savages,
armed to the teeth, who were so intent on

their booty, that they did not perceive the
new-comers.

" Carry off the trunks, Pablo ! Take
care of the lady, Joachim ! She looks like
one for whom we may demand good ransom,"
cried the ruffian, who seemed to be
their leader.

The reply to this injunction was a shot
from Fernando' s pistol, which levelled the
wretch to the earth. The faithful Jose
seconded his master : the driver of the
carriage and the attending servants, encouraged
by the unexpected succour, rallied
round their lady ; and, in a few minutes
the assailants, dismayed by the loss of
their captain, and alarmed also by the
<sound>sound</sound> of horses advancing along the highway,
fled the field.

Don Fernando advanced to the trembling
and frightened travellers (for there
were two females ensconced in the caleche),
whom he had rescued from worse than
death.

^^ The beauty of the Prado !" cried hein
ecstacy; " the lovely devotee of the
Holy Trinity!"

^^ Seraphina, my beloved daughter !" exclaimed
the newly-arrived cavalier, joining
the group — '^ and you, senor, her protector,
her preserver — how can we repay
such services ? Don Fernando ! Is it
indeed, Don Fernando de Guzman?"

"Colonel Hernandez!" — and, without
their at all knowing how it happened, the
two brave hands were joined in the most
cordial grasp of affectionate amity.

" Well, is not this better now, than
fighting for neither could tell what ? "
said Don Manuel, after a few minutes
passed in the warmest expressions of gratitude
on the part of the father and
daughter. '* You will understand, my
good young friend, that I had heard
enough of your conversation with Don
Diego, to be convinced that you were
speaking of Seraphina, without exactly

knowing the degree or the manner of
your acquaintance with her. This occasioned
my taking up the matter with
undue warmth. Upon discovering, however,
how matters stood, I was actually
on my road to your excellent sister. Donna
Leonora, to commission her to mediate
between us ; and, as you confess to having
left her in some trouble, why, I think,
with your permission, we had better proceed
thither now. She will forgive our
untimely visit for the sake of its object."

There is little need to say with how
much delight Don Fernando acceded to
this proposition ; or how much more delicious
the silver light of the moon, the
lulling soit of wind and Waters, and the
balmy scent of the shrubs, which hung
heavy with the night dew from the romantic
defiles of the Sierra Guadarrama,
seemed to the lover, when traversed at the
side of his beloved.

It was long past midnight when they
arrived at the castle, to the unspeakable
pleasure of its fair mistress, and a little to
the disappointment of her waiting maids,
who found, to their no small amazement,
that the cavalier of the signal-torch was
no other than their lady's own brother.

Therefore his age was as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly."

Shakspeare.

^^ ^N'o, Oscar ! no ; your young master
is deer-stalking to-day. Don't you hear
the gun, which has startled Jessy so woefully
? He does not want you just now,
Oscar. His view, before firing that startling
gun, which, wo is me ! will have
more than frightened the poor, pretty

VOL IT. Q

deer; for Allan is such a shot, that he
seldom misses his aim, — his view, before
he frightened Jessy, and awakened the
<sound>echoes</sound> and brought down the red deer
with that sudden <sound>shot</sound>, was to creep towards
them <sound>quietly</sound> and stealthily. He
does not want the good hound, Oscar, today
! Oscar must stay with his mistress."
And as the lovely Agnes Macdonald
spoke coaxingly these coaxing words, her
small, fair hand thrown around Oscar's
neck, as he stood beside her, the noble
animal looked up in her face with his
bright, intelligent eyes, delighting in the
sweetness of the voice, comprehending, or
seeming to comprehend, the meaning of
the words, and acquiescing most contentedly
in her decision. There was, certainly,
no great hardship in standing at the
side of Agnes Macdonald, the beautiful
and the kind ; and with looks that spoke, as
plainly as looks could speak, his affection

and his gratitude, her honest and faithful
favourite (somewhat of the largest and
roughest for a lady's pet), lay down in
calm and <sound>quiet</sound> happiness at her feet.

Her fair companion, the high-bon and
graceful Jessy Stewart, who, startled, as
Agnes had truly said, at the sudden
<sound>sound</sound> of Allan Macdonald's gun, had
been standing in some dismay behind her
friend, now that the shock was passed,
advanced smilingly, and found a seat
upon the bank beside her.

'^ How fond you are, Agnes, of that
huge dog I What would the exquisite
who hovered round you in London and in
Paris say, if they saw you in full dress
too, not as I am, snorted and plaided like
a Highland lassie, with your jewelled
hand resting upon that shaggy head, and
his long, rough body reclined upon the
satin skirt I What would they say to
I •a2

that, ^ my dainty laddie,' as old Cannot is
wont to call you''

"And what matters what they say or
think, Jessy ?" responded the warm-hearted
maiden, kindling into a dignity of youthful
beauty and unconscious stateliness,
pure, delicate, and graceful as the attitude
of a swan upon mountain or lake, or the
station of a doe amongst her native glens.
What care I for the exquisite of Paris
or of London ? Not half as much as for
the mountain posy which you have been
collecting — the harebell, and the heather-sprig,
and our own elegant and abundant
Scottish rose. What is the worth of a
'wilderness of' such monkeys,' compared
to that of our noble, faithful Oscar? What
would be the amount of their services ina
whole century, measured with those
which he has rendered to us ? Why, did
you never hear," continued Agnes, observing

the surprised look with which her
friend regarded her evident excitement;
*' did you never hear of poor Oscar's exploits
in the hard winter, live years back?
'No ; you were in Germany at the time :
and it was before Allan's attachment and
your return of affection (nay, Jessy, a
princess would have no cause to blush for
loving such a man as my brother) ; it was
before this affiance, so gratifying to us all,
had given you a daughter's interest in the
affau's of our house. If you are not afraid
of a long story, I will tell you why it is
that, from the oldest to the youngest, wo
all consider Oscar, not merely as a noble
animal, but a benefactor and a friend.

" You know the pride and delight of
our family, my little sister, Jean ; but you
did not know the beloved and venerable
relative, my dear and excellent grandfather,
of whom she was, from the moment
she could totter across the room, climb
into his lap, and hang prattling round his

necks the prime pet and favourite. He
doted upon the sturdy, hardy, merry little
girl, with her joyous smile, and her joyous
temper, so fearless, open, frank, and
kind; and she, in her turn, idolized the
fine, cheerful, benevolent old man, her
most alert playmate and most indulgent
friend ! Oh ! how they loved each other !
And what a picture it was to see them together
! He, at nearly eighty, still upright,
robust, and vigorous in foi-m^ with
a regular, oval countenance, high, noble
features, hazel eyes, bright and keen as a
falcon's, a mouth of feminine sweetness, a
fine open forehead, a magnificent baldhead,
and long curling hair, as white as
the snow on Ben IS'evis, contrasting with
his clear, ruddy complexion the very hue
of a ripe peach. Oh, what a sight it was
to see that beautiful old man, so full of
health, and life, and glee, and kindliness,
tossing about that rosy, <sound>laughing</sound> child
with the activity of youth ! never weary of

humouring her pretty fancies, and going
even beyond her in innocent mirth, and
fun, and frolic. How Jeanie loved him !
How we all loved him, the dear and venerable
man ! so generous and frank, so open-hearted
and guileless himself, so unsuspicious
of guile in others; so full of
honourable thoughts and disinterested and
affectionate feelings ! how proud we all
were of a relative, whose cheerful and
venerable age accorded so well with his
virtuous and active youth !

The Southron, estimating little except
the conventional benefits of wealth or
station, are apt to sneer at our pride of
ancestry; and perhaps we may a little
overvalue that mere string of names, that
long roll of parchment, a pedigree ; but a
progenitor like Sir Allan Macdonald, or,
as he preferred to be called, Kilburnie, — a
living example for all that is true, and
just, and honourable, and kind, cannot be

too pigmy appreciated. His family, his
clansmen, his very countrymen, were
proud of the good old man, whose sweet
and genial temperament diffused gaiety
and happiness around him. He was a
blessing to the whole country. You will
be a happy woman, Jessy, if my dear
brother, the heir of his estates and his
name, should (as Heaven grant he may)
fulfil the promise of his youth, and inherit
also the frank and winning virtues to
which his grandfather owed his extensive
and remarkable popularity.

^^ Sir Allan being a widower, and my
mother a widow, she and her three children,
Allan, Jeanie, and myself, lived
with him at Kilburnie; Jeanie, younger
than either of us by ten years, and a posthumous
child, being, as I have said, his
playmate and companion; whilst Oscar,
then in his prime, whom my grandfather,
still a keen sportsman, valued above all

greyhounds for his speed (if my venerable
kinsman, in his universal candour and
charity, had a prejudice, it was against
the sleek, high-bred, fine-limbed dogs,
which form the pride of the southern
courser, and Oscar had won a cup from a
round dozen of competitors from !Newmarket,
brought on purpose to oppose
him), and whom Jeanie delighted in for
his gamesomeness, was the constant attendant
of their long rambles.

^^ In spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
in every season, and in all weathers,
would the active old man sally forth with
the hardy little girl, sometimes holding
him by the hand, or when weary, carried
in his arms, and the good hound, Oscar,
bounding on before them. He had an innocent
pride in dropping in with Jeanie in
his hand at houses at a considerable distance,
particularly at the residences of his
daughters and grandchildren (for his

daughters, older than my father, an only-son,
and early married, had scattered his
descendants over the country), and replying,
with a chuckling glee, when questioned
about horses and servants, ^ that he
had walked; that he left such effeminate
as coaches and flunkies to those who
needed them, and was ready to dance a
reel with the youngest lassie present ; and
it should go hard but he would tire her
down : and Jeanie herself will keep it up
with any lad of her inches ; won't you,
Jeanie ?' and the vaunt would end by the
good old man tossing Jeanie upon his
shoulder, and cutting the Highland fling
to his own music.

This was his delight : a ball was
nothing without his presence. If you
had but seen the nod and the wink, the
fulness of his glee, the overflow of his
good-humour, his archness in suspecting,
and sagacity in detecting which lad and

lassie would like to come together for the
dance ; ay, and sometimes for longer than
the dance ! How he would reconcile old
feuds, and cement new friendships ; ay,
and how he would use the influence of age,
and character, and property, even to the
very stretch of his interest, to smooth
difficulties, and turn dim and distant wishes
into present realities ! Many a hopeful
youth has owed his prosperity, many a
gentle maiden her happiness, to the unwearied
benevolence of the kind and
men Sir Allan.

One Christmas he went to Glencora,
accompanied, as usual, by Jeanie and
Oscar, to keep the birthday of his favourite
daughter. Lady Macleod. My brother
was detained at home by a slight indisposition
; and the weather was so severe,
that my mother, always delicate, was afraid
to venture, I myself being too young to
be regularly introduced, and too tall to

pass for a child. Sir Allan had fixed to
return on Xew Year's Eve, the succeeding
day being always one of high festivity
at Kilbumie, the servants and neighbours
dining in the great hall, and the
whole castle being alive with festivity and
jollity.

It was an occasion on which we felt that
he would be very unwilling to absent himself,
and yet the day fixed for his return
was so tremendous, that we took for
granted Lady Macleod would detain her
honoured guest at Glencora. Snow had
fallen during the whole of the preceding
night, accompanied by a drifting wind, so
that to send carriages and horses was impracticable,
every vestige of the road, a
wild mountain-track, at the best, was impassable,
or my brother would have gone
under the pretence of fetching Jeanie ; for
we all knew well, that the only shade that
ever crossed the brightness of our dear

grandfather's countenance, was occasioned
by his suspicion of being taken care of, —
an affront which the hardy sportsman
would have regarded with as much jealousy
and displeasure as would be evinced by a
veteran of the wars at any precaution that
should imply a doubt of his personal prowess.


This consideration alone deterred my
brother from setting forth to Glencora in
person ; and as the day grew wilder and
wilder, all around, hill, plain, and valley,
covered with a sheet of fragile, glittering
white, with scarcely an hour's intermission
of incessant snowfall, and the night closed
in with bitter gusts of wind, which blew
the frozen and feathery particles against
the face with blinding violence ; even my
mother, a nervous and timorous woman,
with a revered parent and a beloved child
at stake, made up her mind to believe
that, as it was evidently impossible that

the expected guests would reach Kilbumie
Castle on the morrow, its master would be
content to remain where he was. Weather
less formidable, so that it might laye
afforded some chance of his finding the
road, or some probability of the arrival of
his guests the next day, would have been
more alarming. To have stirred out in
such a fall as this seemed impossible. So
we went to bed in comfort.

'' About an hour after midnight we were
awakened by a tremendous <sound>noise</sound> at the
gate of the castle, a mixture of <sound>scratching</sound>
and <sound>howling</sound>. Upon opening the door, it
was found to be our friend, Oscar, who,
instantly singling out my brother, leaped
upon him with a piteous <sound>cry</sound>, and then
went on a little way beyond the gate, returning
to see if Allan followed him (who
delayed a few minutes to furnish himself
with a lantern, and men with hurdles,
mattresses, and ropes), pulling him by the

coat-skirts with the most urgent <sound>whine</sound>,
wagging his tail when he began to move,
and enticing him forward by every means
in his power. Oh, I shall never forget
the poor dog's piteous ways, his trembling
earnestness, his eager looks, and the expression
of his anxious <sound>cry</sound> — no human
voice could have conveyed his meaning
more distinctly. Xever shall I forget that
moment, nor the hour of agonizing suspense
that followed."

" They were saved?" inquired Jessy,
anxiously, breaking <sound>silence</sound> for the first time.

'' Oscar led his party to a hollow by the
hill-side, about three miles distant ; and
there the venerable old man was found
leaning against the rock in a half-recumbent
posture, so as to shelter the child,
who was clasped to his bosom. The snow
was gathering around them. Sleep had
crept upon both, and, in another hour, all
help would have been unavailing,"

" But they were saved ?" again inquired
Jessy.

Thanks to Oscar's fidelity and intelligence,
they were. By proper care, they
both recovered sufficiently to dance at the
proposed festival on Old I^ew Year's Day.
Our dear grandfather lived in health and
happiness until last year, just before we
had the happiness of renewing our friendship
with your family ; and Jeanie is, you
know, as lively and as lifelike a little personage
as treads this most excellent earth.
And now, my dearest Jessy, do you wonder
that Oscar — look at him, poor fellow, he
knows that we are talking of him ! — Do
you wonder that this noble and sagacious
animal should be my pet?"

I

Gaoler, look to him ; — tell not me of mercy."

Shakespeare.

Else, I beseech thee, Isidore ! If the
peace and comfort — (why do I name such
words) — if the very existence of thy poor
wife be dear to thee — I implore thee flee !
By the memory of our young loves, by
the happy days we have known together —
by that closer and dearer tie, the sorrows
that we have shared — ^by the precious
VOL n. K

boy at whose couch, we watched in vain —
by the smiling girl who now lies lapped
in the unconscious sleep of infancy — by
the dead for whom we mourned — and by
that living blessing whom God in His
mercy sent to compensate that mighty
woe — by a father's hopes and a father's
duties I conjure thee, flee ! See, I am
tall — the cloak hangs nearly as low over
thy ancles as over mine, thou need'st but
droop a little thy manly form as if in
grief — oh ! what wife could walk erect
from the prison of her husband ! — thou
hast but to di'aw the capote over thy brow,
and to let fall the veil, and hold thy
handkerchief to thy eyes — alas ! did I
ever leave thee other than weeping? —
and thou wilt pass undiscovered. Or
suffer me to arrange this hair, and thou
mayest defy detection. Dost thou not
remember how often in our wooing days
W8 have passed for brother and sister?

How often thou thyself hast vowed, Avhen
thy comrades have been vaunting the
delicate bloom of their blue-eyed maidens,
that thou didst rather prize the swart
skin and jetty eye of the rich South than
the dainty red and white of their rose-tipped
beauties. Alas ! it was the love
in that eye that won thy heart. And
canst thou now resist its appeal, now that
love and life hang upon thy consent ?
Flee, my Isidore ! if thy wife, if thy child
be dear to thee, wrap thee in this disguise
and flee ! "

And leave thee here to perish ! "
Nay, my husband, nay ! not to perish,
but to join thee speedily in some distant
land, and live a calm and blissful life in
safety and in freedom. Wrap thyself in
this cloak, and away. Away then, I
conjure thee! The patrole ^vill soon go
their rounds, and the sentinel who is now
on duty will be changed. Nay, I have

R 2

not taken him into our counsel. Look
not reproachfully. But well I know that
Andi-e Dual will show nought but respect
and sympathy when he sees me, or one
whom he takes for me, pass in soitow
from the place. Dally no longer. Lisette
waits without to conduct thee to her
mother's abode, one of the old niches
about K'otre Dame, where thou lightest
be safe for ages. There thou shalt stay
until the search be passed, and then we
will depart for America-nay, wherefore
shake thy head ? I shall be safe and free.
Be sure of that. The Imperial Josephine,
although even she may not venture to
intercede for one who has so transgressed
the hard iron martial law as to challenge
his superior officer, will yet full surely
protect her favoured hand-maiden — one
whose wedding she was graciously pleased
to honour with her presence, — from the
effects of her wifely love. Alas, was I

not the wretched cause of this calamity ?
Is it not through thy love for me that
thou art still in prison? and wilt thou
deny me the blessed privilege of setting
thee free ? "

And no longer able to resist her persuasions,
Colonel de Goui^billon did submit
to array himself in Adele's garments, and,
having safely passed the sentinel on
guard, was in a few minutes following
the steps of Mademoiselle Lisette from
the prison of La Force to the precincts of
notre Dame.

The escape was complete and successful
: but an unexpected circumstance
rendered poor Adele's stratagem unavailing,
and replaced Isidore once again in
his dungeon, and in all the peril attendant
upon a breach of military law under the
iron rule of Napoleon.

******

It was a right queenly chamber tha

boudoir, into which the soft air of an
April morning stole so wooingly ; and yet
its pervading beauty spoke rather of
elegance than of splendour. The prevailing
taste of its fair and gentle mistress
was everywhere visible. Flowers, pictured
to the life by the deft needle of the embroidered,
bordered the pale pink hangings,
which shed a tender blush over the
apartment ; flowers, bright from the loom
of Arras, seemed strewn in gay confusion
over the rich but delicate carpet ; flowers,
fresh from the dewy gardens, glowed in
the flower-painted jars of Sevres porcelain,
which crowded the marble tables, whilst
plants, the fairest and choicest of the hothouse
and conservatory, were grouped in
alabaster vases, catching the soft light of
the veiled windows.

On a Grecian couch, near a half-curtained
recess, sat a gracious and graceful
lady, the fitting inmate of this scene of

enchantment. Her dress, even to the
lilies in her bosom and the Provence rose
in her hand, was of pure and spotless
white, the most exquisite in texture and
most becoming in form. Her shape and
features were faultless in contour and expression.
If the bloom of youth were
faded, it was more than replaced by
sweetness and sensibility. At the moment
of which we write, that lovely countenance
wore the gentlest look of pity as she
addressed a sad and <sound>weeping</sound> lady, who
had just been admitted to her presence: —

Ma pauvre Adele ! I had heed and
believed that you were still the joyful
occupant of your husband's prison. I
never thought to be so sorry to see you at
St. Cloud. Colonel de Roussillon is then
retaken?"

Not retaken, may it please your
Majesty : he accomplished his escape in
safety, and reached a retreat where he

•

might have remained undiscovered until
the day of doom; but the sentinel who
watched the door of his cell on the evening
of his departure was to be held responsible
for his prisoner. Had not Isidore surrendered
himself, that poor soldier must
have now been the victim ; and dearly as
I love my husband, or rather, because I
do love him dearly, I could not have
wished him so saved. He is again in
prison, and the sentinel free."

" Was that sentinel an accomplice in
the escape ?"

!N'o^n my word of honour, gracious
Madam. He was my foster brother, the
son of my good old nurse, and would not,
as we well knew, raise the veil, or pull
away the handkerchief from, as he supposed,
a weeping life, as a rougher warder
might have done ; but we took more than
common pains to preserve him from all
suspicion of our plans, for his sake and

our own. Poor Andre ! he at least will
escape !"

*^ And after all, what was the cause of
this unhappy challenge ?"

" Alas ! alas ! royal Madam, I was the
thrice unhappy and most unconscious
cause ! "Walking on the Boulevard Italien
with Madame le Vasseur, General Pillared,
heated, as he says, by wine, and mistaking
me for my cousin, Pauline de St. Brie
(your Imperial Majesty has often noticed
our sister-like resemblance), to whom, as
it now appears, he has been for some
months secretly married, accosted me in a
manner which occasioned me the most
lively alarm. My husband came up at the
moment ; the General, certainly not himself,
and hardly aware of his mistake,
treated the matter with provoking levity.
Madame le Vasseur's presence and my
tears, put, for the time, an effectual check
on Isidore. He hurried us home, and then

wrote that unhappy letter, — that challenge
to a superior officer, — which falling, I
hardly know how, into the hands of the
minister at war, constitutes the sole and
fatal proof of his breach of martial law ;
for General Pillared, as much distressed as
man can be, and full of self-blame and
self-accusation, denies all recollection, except
of his own misconduct. ! if that
fatal letter could be regained or destroyed !
or if the real facts of the case could be
brought under the notice of him in whose
word will lie the final sentence, — the awful
doom of life or death. ! if he could

Here a slight movement of caution, and
perhaps of uneasiness on the part of Josephine,
and a <sound>noise</sound> like the <sound>rustling</sound> of

papers, suddenly stopped Adele's pleadings,
and directed her attention to the half
curtained recess. It opened on a small
turret chamber, fitted up as a private
study, and at a writing table, folding a
letter, sat a gentleman, plainly dressed ina
single-breasted green coat, a white kerseymere
waistcoat, and the ribbon of the
legion of honour at his button-hole. His
little cocked hat was on a chair at his side;
and although his noble head was bent over
the letter which he was folding, Adele felt,
at once, that it was no other than Napoleon.
Papers were strewed before him,
and amongst these the eyes of the trembling
wife rested upon her husband's well-known
writing, the challenge upon which
his fate and hers depended.

The Emperor paused in his occupation,
and applied to his snuff-box for his habitual
luxury; his countenance was calm
and untroubled, and, but for a momentary

glance towards the curtained doorway, it
might have been doubted if he were conscious
that he was not alone.

" Speak I" whispered Josephine, encouragingly.
" Plead your husband's
cause !"

Five minutes before, Madame de Gour-dillon
would have given her right hand for
such an opportunity. Now it had amved,
and between reverential awe of her great
master and the tremendous interest which
she had at stake, she knelt before him,
weak and wordless as a child.

'' Pardon, Sire ! pardon ! " Her voice
died away, and had not a passion of tears
come to relieve her she would have fainted.

Napoleon made no answer. He was
about to seal the letter which he had
folded, and selecting a paper from the
table, he first used it to light the wax
taper which stood in a richly chased golden
candlestick by his side, and then flung it

into the brazier, tapping his snuff-box ashe
watched the burning fragments, and
glancing upon the happy wife, and her
sympathizing mistress, with a smile exquisite
in its sweetness and beauty. Perhaps
at that moment his sensations were
the most enviable of the three.

'Need I say that the paper which he had
destroyed was the only proof of Isidore's
guilt — the all-important cartel ?

For love thou know'st is full of jealousy."

Shakspeare.

It ^as on a bright balmy eying
towards the end of July, that half the
population of this sunny side of Berkshire
were pouring through the suburbs of Belford
Eegis, on their return from the annual
festival, popularly called the Cherry Fair,
because it forms the great mart for the
waggon-loads of that luscious fruit, which

blacken the orchards, skirt the beech woods,
and dot the commons, of that wild and
beautiful tract of country which runs along
the northern banks of the Thames. Carriages
of every variety, from the lordly
landau (our story bears date some five and
forty years back), with its four prancing
steeds and its liveried outriders, to the
humble caravan crowded with women and
children, already fretful from the fatigue
which, in lower as in higher life, treads so
close upon the heels of pleasure ; all sorts
of wheeled vehicles — chariots, phaetons,
curricles, gigs, and carts; horsemen of
every rank, and foot-people of all ages and
denomination; some tipsy, some sober,
some merry, some sad, all came pouring
from the fair ; and the stu* and movement
of the different groups, the <sound>sound</sound> of so
many passengers, talking, <sound>laughing</sound>, hallooing,
and <sound>whooping</sound>, mingled with the
distant <sound>noises</sound> of the scene of action, where

the <sound>ringing</sound> of bells, the <sound>beating</sound> of drums,
the lowing of cattle, and the <sound>blowing</sound> of
trumpets, contended with, and at times
nearly overpowered, the mingled <sound>hum</sound> of
the multitude, formed a scene, which,
lighted by the bright beams of a midsummer
sun, and fanned by the pleasant evening
breeze, had something peculiarly exhilarating
in its aspect and character.

Standing upon the hill which parts Belford
Eegis from Aberleigh, and looking
towards the old town, its towers and steeples
glittering in the sunshine, its venerable
buildings mingled with groves and gardens,
and crowned with terraces of a lighter and
gayer style of architecture, the clear waters
of the Bennet spanned by noble bridges
and crowded with barges and pleasure
vessels, whilst river, bridges, streets, and
quays, were all alive with the gay and
stirring population, rolling its apparently
inexhaustible tides upward from the good

to\ni, and then onward through broad
avenues and tufted lanes, into the neighbouring
country beyond ; looking from the
point, it was scarcely possible for the coldest
observer not to be gratified by a spectacle
so full of innocent, although somewhat
boisterous, gaiety, and wide spreading
enjoyment.

Among the most gratified of these spectators
was a somewhat stern-looking dame,
who sat in her own porch before a small
farm-house, just without the suburbs of
Belford Eegis, and took off her spectacles,
and laid aside her knitting, to survey her
pretty grand-daughter Susan, who, followed
by two fine boys, her brothers, one beating
most lustily a child's drum, the other
shouldering with great pride and valour

a toy musket, approached slowly from the
fair.

Susan Wharton was one of the prettiest

lasses of the country side, and her sweet-vol

II s

ness and modesty equalled her beauty. She
and her brothers were orphans, but had
been carefully brought up by her father's
mother, the venerable matron of the
knitting-needle and the spectacles, who,
having a small but excellent pasture-farm
close to the town, and being an active,
stirring, bustling dame, accomplished in
all the arts of the dairy, contrived to make
a good living for herself and her grandchildren
by supplying the inhabitants with
cream, milk, butter, and other pastoral
luxuries. Lone woman though she were,
the world had gone well with her, and she
had scarcely known a care since the sudden
and almost simultaneous death of her son
and her son's wife, except indeed the
dread occasioned by the perversity and
headstrong temper of Eobert Goring, her
pretty grand daughter's favoured suitor,
who, whenever a fit of jealousy came
across him, which was far oftener than

ought to have occurred, considering the
reserve and prudence of his fair mistress,
(but when did jealousy listen to reason !)
was sure to avenge himself by threatening
to turn soldier ; a threat of all others most
grievous to Dame Wharton's ears, whose
eldest grandson, having enlisted during his
father's life, had thereby occasioned to his
affectionate relatives a species of trouble
and anxiety unknown in the traditions of
that peaceful family since the time of a
certain Rupert Wharton, some 
of poor James, who had
followed the fortunes of his illustrious
namesake, and fallen in the king's service
during the civil wars.

Jem's delinquency, and the threat to
follow his example so frequently held outby
Eobert Goring, had so strongly impressed
Dame Wharton's imagination, that
her natural pride and pleasure at the sight
of her blooming grandchildren was some

2

what lessened by the martial array in
which the two boys presented themselves.
I suppose it 's some foolish present of
Eobert Goring' s,'' said the good dame to
her faithful adherent, Jenny Stubbs, a
short damsel, who assisted in the care of
the cows, as well as in carrying milk and
better about the town, and had been left
to attend her mistress during the absence
of her gi-grandchildren ; ' ' It 's certainly
some folly of Eobert' s, for I am sure that
Susan would never have given the boys
such nonsensical toys, fit only to put war,
and soldiering, and such nonsensical notions
into their' heads, poor children ! But
where is Eobin ?" added she, as Susan approached;
sand what ring is that upon
your finger ? You have not gone to church
without leave or licence, to be sure, Susan,
now that all 's arranged for your being
married at Christmas, when Eobert is settled
in his own little farm? I wonder

what his uncle, Master Goring, the cooper,
who has been as good as a father to him,
would say to that. Speak, child, can't
you ? Are you married ? — yes or no ? or
has Eobert bought the ring beforehand,
and got you to put it on in this way to
make a fool of your old grandmother ?'^

^* No, indeed," returned Susan ! ^^ I
would not have done anything so disrespectful
to you, grandmother, for twenty
Robins. This is no wedding-ring."

No ?" said her grandmother, assuming
her spectacles to take a second view of the
slender finger and the glittering gem which
encircled it; and comparing both with her
own hard, ruddy hand, ^^ Xo !" exclaimed
she, eyeing it more intently, ^*this gimcrack
isn't such a ring as I was married
with. But why dost wear it upon thy
wedding-finger, child? and who gave it to
thee ? Eh ? Eobin ? Ah ! he's a foolish boy
to throw away so much money. I warrant

it cost a good half-guinea. And the boys
and their nonsense ! Ah ! those young
heads ! I warrant he's been finely cheated !
Eobert bought it in the fair ?"

No indeed, grandmother !" responded
Susan.

Not Eobert ! Who then ? " inquired
Dame What-ton, with great sternness. ' ' How
dare you accept a present from any one
else ? Ah, child ! child ! she that takes
rings from fresh acquaintance little deserves
that an honest man should seek to
put one upon her wedding-finger. Who
gave it to you, hussy ? speak, I say ! Who
gave you the ring ?"

I must not tell you his name, dear
grandmother," began Susan, with great
agitation ; ''I have promised not to tell !
You wrong me, grandmother ! indeed you
do !" <sound>sobbed</sound> the <sound>weeping</sound> beauty. " It
was no fresh acquaintance ! Indeed, indeed
it was not ! but I cannot tell his

name. I have promised not to tell anyone,
not even Eobert or you !"

Athk me," interrupted the young gentleman
with the musket, interposing between
his angry grandmother and his
frightened sister, with an alacrity and
boldness of bearing, which together with
his readiness and shrewdness of speech
contrasted <sound>laughably</sound> with an infantine lisp,
from which IS'ed, his younger brother, (he
of the drum,) was perfectly free.

Athk me, grandmother, and don't
thcold poor thither Thuthan ! Athk me ;
I know the whole thtowy," pursued Master
"Willy, shifting his weapon most energetically
with both hands from shoulder to
shoulder.

Brother Jem, the roger 's come to Belford
!" bawled Ned, <sound>shouting</sound> at the top of
his voice to overcome the <sound>noise</sound> of his own
drum.

Yet," resumed Willy, " when brother

Deem put the wing on thither 
finger lie pwomethed to make mea
drummer, a weal drummer, not a than,
like IN'ed, but a weal drummer"

" And me a fifer !" shouted Ned, still
accompanying himself with his noisyan-
instrument.

^^ Hath thorn hath ever I with hath tall
hath the musket; provided," resumed this
discreet keeper of secrets, " provided we
never thai a syllable of with being at
the fair ! A weal drummer ! think of
that !"

" And a real fifer !"

'^ Drummer and fifer, fifer and drummer,"
shouted the boys in chorus ! '^ And
brother Deem can make me a drummer,"
added Master Willy, in a confidential
whisper addressed to his grandmother, " for
he 'th a therdzeant and earth a thwath ! —
a therdzeant with a think thwath !"

'' Not silk," interposed Ned ; ^ Worsted."

Think, I that " rejoined Willy.

And the one beating a grand tattoo, and
the other shouldering arms, off the two
boys marched, each shouting at the top of
his childish voice, " Think !" " Worsted !''
'' Worsted !" " Think," until the <sound>sound</sound> was
lost in the distance.

Jem a serjeant ! and at Belford ! But
why not come here, Susan ? and why desire
you to keep his being there a secret ?
I don't see any msdom in such secrets,"
said the good dame, shaking her head.
'' And poor Eobin, what '11 he say, I wonder
? And why does Jem desire you to
wear this foolish ring ? It 's enough to
make the lad enlist in good earnest."

"Why, dear grandmother, that's the
very thing that Jem wants; not that he
should enlist in reality, grandmother;
nor that he should go for a soldier ; but
to cure him of these threats and jealousies.
Somebody told James, who came to Belford

this morning reciting, how foolish
Eobin had been about Harry Goddard
and George Elton, and everybody who
spoke to me or looked at me, whether I
spoke to them or not. So when I met
him, and — oh dear, grandmother, what
a fine stately man he is grown ! — and
when he found me out (for he hardly
knew me at first), and had kissed me
and hugged the boys — how pleased he
was with Willy — she insisted on my
taking this ring, which he received from
some great lady to whom he had done
a service abroad, and brought it here that
it might be sold and serve for my 
: he insisted on my wearing
it on my wedding-finger, and not satisfying
Eobin' s curiosity farther than by
telling him solemnly that no lover gave it
to me ; so that either he might put such
a trust in my word and my truth as a
husband ought to put — or, if that were

too good to happen, that he might enlist
in James's own party, and so be let off
tomorrow after having a good fright.
I was not willing to play poor Eobin
such a trick ; for you know, dear grandmother,
there was little chance if he
saw the ring but he would fly off ; only
James insisted on the misery of a jealous
husband — and so — ''

'' And so Eobert did see the ring, and
did fly off? I thought something was
amiss when you came home without
him," said the grandmother.

*' Yes 1" sighed Susan, " he did see the
ring, poor fellow ! as soon as ever he rejoined
me : he had been to help his aunt
and cousins into their cart when I met
James ; he did see the ring, and asked me
over and over again how I came by it,
and who gave it to me. Willy and Ned
were gone with James to see Punch and
the wild beasts, or else — but I had promised

James not to tell. And, thank
Heaven, Eobert said nothing of enlisting
this time. So that I hope all will go
right."

heaven send it may'' said her
careful grandame; " but I love no secrets,
and playing at enlisting is playing with
edge-tools. Hearken, Busy ! if Eobert
should come here to-night, send him to me.
I must go see after the skimming!" and
with a nod as eloquent as Lord Burleigh's,
the good dame repaired to her dairy.

Susan, although somewhat comforted
by Dame Wharton's last speech, could not
quite get rid of certain apprehensions
that clung about her. She hummed
unconsciously her grandmother's favourite
ditty—

'' I hate yon drum's discordant sound,
Parading round, and round, and round " —

whenever the distant <sound>noise</sound> of the recruiting

party reached her from the to^ni, or
the <sound>din</sound> of poor "Ned^s new toy <sound>echoed</sound>
through the mansion ; and over and over
again did she lament the attractions of
Punch, and of the lions, elephants, and
monkeys which had detained "Willy from
her side at a moment when his genius for
explanations would have been invaluable
to her unhappy lover ; for accustomed to
love Eobert, faults and all, and almost
persuaded to consider his rash and violent,
but often repented and easily
appeased jealousy, as a proof of the
strength of his passion, the soft-hearted
beauty was more alive to the danger
of losing her betrothed than to the peril
in which this solitary failing might place
her future happiness. She even contemplated
the possibility of sending Willy
in quest of her luckless swain ; but again
the great show of wild beasts stood in
her way. It had so happened that poor

Eobin himself, always generous, especially
to the boys whom their sister loved so
dearly, had presented them the Christmas
before with a Dutch toy called a
noah's Ark, consisting of a curiously
fashioned compound of boat and house,
filled not merely with the quaintly
habited wooden figures representing the
Patriarch's family, attired with an amplitude
of apparel and a splendour of
colouring which did honour to the Hollander's
fancy, but with a variety of pairs
of animals decked in hues almost as splendid
and quite as unlike nature as those
with which the Dutch artist had bedecked
our antediluvian progenitors. Over this
toy, preserved for them with great care
by the grandmother, the young students
in natural history were quietly seated,
so deeply engaged in comparing those
beasts which they had seen in the morning
with their wooden prototypes in the

Ark (where, by the way, they were most
artificially stowed one above the other,
the receptacle being scarcely capable of
containing them when shoved in en masse
whence divers accidents to leg and tail,
head and horn), that nothing short of a
proposal to revisit Signer Polite's menagerie
could have stirred them.

I hate yon drum's discordant sound,
Parading round, and round, and round,"

half <sound>sung</sound>, half <sound>sighed</sound>, poor Susan.

I hate yon dwom'th discordant hound,
Parading wound, and wound, and wound,"

gaily echoed Master Willy.

No, Ned," added the young gentleman,
snatching from his little brother's
hand a mutilated nondescript, minus three
legs, one tail, and half a head, and proffering

in its place another monster cut
asunder in the middle like Baron Munchausen's
horse, and presenting a formidable
home head and two fore legs, sans
the body and hind quarters usually found
in quadrupeds of all descriptions.

'' That'll a mistake. Thigh with the
other thee."

"That!" rejoined !Need, "that's as red
as Cherry's calf. It's a lion."

A lion !" repeated Willy contemptuously
; "a lion with homth ! Look at the
wam'th hornth ! Thither Thuthan, look!
It'th a warn. Thee the hornth. Grandmother
calleth Dzonth the chandler hath
crooked hath a wam'th horn. It 'th a warn !
Look, thither Thuthan ! those thee are
black, and those may be wed. Ith'nt it a
wan, Thuthan? Ithn't led wong?'

Susan suggested that, so far as could
be judged from the relics of the animal,
both were probably mistaken, those interesting

remains bearing most resemblance
to a cow — an undignified solution of the
enigma which, united both disputants
against their fair referee ; and Dame
"Wharton returning fi'om the dairy, and
summoning the boys to supper and to
bed, Susan reluctantly abandoned all hope,
for that evening at least, of undeceiving
her devoted but irascible lover.

Before dawn the next morning the
young damsel, who slept in a small chamber
of which the casement overhung the
garden, heard a low tap at her window,
accompanied by the peculiar bird-like
<sound>whistle</sound> which had so often summoned the
rustic Juliet, late and early, to the brief
delight of a stolen dialogue with her enamoured
Eomeo.

Wrapping a large cloak about her,
Susan stood leaning her hand against the
open window.

'^Eobin! dear Eobin !'»

VOL II. T

Eobert could not see the rosy lips wych
spoke these few and simple words, but the
tone, sweet, gentle, caressing, affectionate,
implied all that could be imagined of truth
and tenderness. It was a tone as sweet
and open as her own sweet smile. He
mustered all his indignation to resist the
charm, and succeeded.

I come here, Susan," said Eobert, in
low, resolute accents, ^^ to ask you, for the
last time, from whom, and for what purpose,
you received the ring which I saw
you wear yesterday. By Heaven, I see it
now glittering in the moonlight. Answer
this question, or we part for ever."

** It is a question, Eobin, which I have
promised not to answer at present. I can
only tell you that I received it from no
one who can interfere with our attachment.
More I must not, cannot, tell !"

*must not! cannot! say will not''
rejoined Eobert, in a voice of deep and

concentrated anger. " Say will not, Susan!
Once again, and for the last time, I ask
you this plain question, — From whom did
you receive this gewgaw ? Answer ! or
may my right hand be struck off before I
place the wedding-ring on your finger!"

" Oh, dearest Eobin ! grant me but a
few short hours. Believe my word, dear
Eobert. Confide in my affection, in my
faith!" exclaimed the poor girl, as her
lover turned furiously away ; "or ask my
grandmother," added she ; or inquire of
Willy ; they are bound by no promise,"
continued she, not regarding in her
anxiety how much she was infringing her
own. But if she did break her word it
was to little purpose ; the jealous lover
fled from the garden hearing or unheeding
; and although no threat of enlisting
had been spoken, no farewell had been
breathed, she remained persuaded that he
had taken his measures, and with something

T 2

Very like a presentiment that her brother's
hasty plan would, as deception, however
well intended, often does, lead to evil
rather than to good. And so it proved.

Before noon on the next day tames
Wharton learnt that Eobert Goring had
enlisted the night before, not with his
party, but with one belonging to another
regiment stationed in Belford for the
occasion of the fair; that, immediately
upon ascertaining that Susan still refused
to answer his question, he had repaired to
his Sergeant Kite to announce his continued
desire to enter the service ; that as
soon as admittance could be obtained, he
had been examined and attested before the
mayor and other magistrates ; and that he
and the recruiting party were by that time
some miles on their way to the depot of
the regiment. It was in the very heat of
the Peninsular War ; men were scarce,
especially men so tall and finely formed,

SO spirited and so active as poor Eobert.
It was impossible to procure his release,
and James and his sister were left to
bewail the ill consequences of his unlucky
experiment, and Dame Wharton to lament,
again and again, the evil destiny which
led her descendants, and those connected
with them, to go, as she phrased it, a
sogeinng. The only comfort she derived
upon the occasion (next, perhaps, to that
general scolding of the guilty and the
innocent, the efficacy of which as a consolation
under affliction is well known to most
ancient dames well to do in the world, who
wear spectacles, knit stockings, and love
their own way), her prime comfort consisted
in cutting IN'ed's drum to pieces, to
the great improvement of the tranquillity
of the rustic homestead, and in throwing
"Willy's musket into the fire.

Tears passed away. The poor boys

grown into fine stout lads, tended the cows
and carried the milk through the streets
of Belford Eegis; exhibiting no more dangerous
warlike propensities than an inordinate
ambition on the part of "Willy to
possess a gun for the purpose of shooting
sparrows. !Nothing had been heard of
Eobert; and James Wharton, now serjeant-major
of his regiment, remained at a
distance, sharing the perils and the victories
of the British army. Still, however,
Dame Wharton, all peaceful as were her
inclinations, had the ill luck to find the
destinies of those she loved unexpectedly
influenced by the warlike spirit of the times.
Poor Susan, restless and unhappy at home
had entered into the service of her noble
landlord's daughter, as her own woman ;
and, during the short peace which preceded
Napoleon's return from Elba, the Lady
Anne had been wooed and won by one of
the gallant staff which surrounded the

great Duke ; and too much attached to her
husband to remain at a distance from, the
field of action, the young bride and her
favourite waiting-maid were actually in
Brussels during the crowning victory of
Waterloo.

You are a soldier's sister, Susan's said
the Lady Anne to her attendant, with her
usual sweet grace, a few days after the
great battle ; '^ have you any objection to
go with me this morning to the military
hospital? A private belonging to my
husband's division threw himself between
him and a French cuirassier who was
about to cut him down with his sabre, and
received the blow destined for Sir Charles.
Of course every care has been taken of
him, and he is likely to recover, poor fellow,
thank Heaven ! but I wish to carry him a
few comforts, to see with my own eyes

that he is kindly attended, and thank
him with my own lips for preserving a
life dearer than my own. Charles has
sent to the surgeon to be in waiting : so
order the carriage, and we will set forth."
Laden with comforts and restoratives,
mistress and maid proceeded to the hospital,
neither of them perhaps quite prepared for
the inevitable horrors of the scene. Crowds
of soldiers, for the most part severely
wounded, filled the apartment into which
they were ushered. Pain and death
seemed busy around them. Sufferings,
only the more affecting for the bravery
with which they were borne, spoke in
every countenance. Young, timid, and
softly-nurtured, the Lady Anne, overcome
by such a realization of the miseries of
war as her imagination, even so close to
the scene, had hardly pictured, delivered
to the friendly surgeon a slip of paper
upon which the name of her husband's

preserver was written. He led the way to
a bed near a window.

'* Poor fellow ! his wars are over ! say,
nay, your Ladyship must not misunderstand
me. His life is in no danger ; but
he has been compelled to submit to amputation:
and as his friends are said to be
well off, why the empty sleeve, in his ease,
will be only "

His speech was checked by a sudden
<sound>exclamation</sound>, almost a <sound>shriek</sound>, from his
patient.

'' Susan ! Susan Wharton ! my Susan !"

"Eobin ! dearKobin!"

Lady Anne knew the story, and witnessed
the recognition with the sympathy
of a young unpractised heart. She too
had loved a soldier ; and the poor sufferer
now before her had received his hurt in
that dear soldier's defence. Tears contended
with smiles as she gazed upon the
couple, already reunited, for Susan was

hanging over the couch, and her hand
was locked in that of Eobert. He looked
at her wedding-finger : the ring was gone.

^^ Eobin ! dear Eobin !'' Her voice
failed her.

^^ I know what you would say, Susan !''
replied Eobert. " It was your brother
James. "We met in Spain and he told me
the whole truth. Do you remember my
wicked vow ? I am a poor maimed object
now, Susan; I have no right hand to
put the wedding-ring upon that dear
finger "

'' But you can put the ring on with the
left, dear Eobin ! You can put it on with
the left !" said Susan, smiling through her
tears : and never, in spite of pain, and
wounds, and danger, and suffering, throbbed
two happier hearts than those of the reconciled
lovers, in the crowded wards of
the Brussels hospital.

If thou be he, then art thou prisoner '

Shakspeare

There have been prisons of more pretension,
as witness the cells of the Inquisition,
and places of exile of grander name,
the frozen deserts of Siberia for instance,
or the sweltering swamps of Surinam ; but
for a chill, barren, heart-breaking monotony
— a weary, dreary, dragging on of life,
when all that renders life bearable is taken

away, commend me to a Passion fortress
during the reign of that literary coxcomb,
small poet, eminent soldier, sad despot, but
tolerably amusing, and by fits tolerably
well natured personage, Frederick, misnamed
the Great. To be sure the inmates,
if it be true that the misfortunes of others
convey some consolation in calamity, had
the wretched comfort of knowing that from
the whole country, flat, dull, and ugly
enough at the best, being little better thana
camp or a battle plain ; the towns and
cities, huge barracks ; and every citizen,
from the tottering great grandfather to the
infant in the cradle, a soldier, past, present,
or future, responsible for the slightest infringement
of an all but impracticable
military code ; there was not an individual
in the kingdom who might not be in an
instant imprisoned like themselves. But
without venturing to dispute the general
truth of Eochefoucault's celebrated maxim,

it may be doubted whether the captive,
pacing for the millionth time the stone
floor of his dungeon, and vainly trying to
divine the fault for which he was incarcerated,
could derive much pleasure from
reflecting that half his friends and kinsmen
might at some future day be in equal
jeopardy.

Next in discomfort to the prisoners
within those dismal cells, were the jailers,
who kept ward without, and who, cooped
up between the walls of the fortress, were,
as compared to those whom they guarded,
pretty much as birds in an aviary compared
with the same order of feathered
bipeds in a cage. At Spandau the commandant.
Major Klein wits, an invalid
soldier, found so much difficulty in obtaining
assistants for Hans Klaus, who had
the dungeons in charge, that he thought
himself lucky in gaining the service of a
pretty youth, who called himself Wilhelm

Steinfort ; an orphan, who, having recently
lost an only brother, cared, he said, nothing
for the world without the walls, and showed
great zeal in assisting Klaus ; who, lame
from the consequences of an old wound,
found much difficulty in passing up and
down the steep stone stairs, whilst carrying
their scanty meals to the miserable inmates
of the cells.

Two or three, distinguished by triple
padlocks, each boasting its different keys —
keys whose intricacy and convolutions
seemed dim forebodings of the wonders of
Branch, — were reserved by Klaus for his
own especial attendance. One should think
that Wilhelm saw enough of the poor
captives ; but these prisoners seemed to
excite his curiosity not a little. One
morning, taking advantage of a fit of good
humour on the part of his master, and of
his master's lady and mistress, Madame
Klaus, he prevailed upon him to allow

each of the poor wretches a solitary walk
in a small yard, closed in on every side by
the steep walls of the fortress, and scarcely
even at noon-tide admitting one glimpse of
the blessed sun ; and as they emerged,
pale and haggard, into the light of day, he
brushed the tears from his eyes, and gazed
upon their wasted forms and wan complexions,
with the eagerness with which a
mother would seek for a missing child.
Apparently Wilhelm's search had been in
vain. One prisoner amongst those most
carefully guarded, and one alone, had not
shared an indulgence too dangerous for
repetition. Wilhelm, as soon as he ascertained
the fact, hastened to the triply
locked door. '^ Max !" and the <sound>exclamation</sound>
of surprise and joy with which that
earnest <sound>whisper</sound> was acknowledged and
reciprocated told at a word that the search-was
at an end.

For three weary days, days which,

although really of the shortest in January,
seemed long as those of June, the triply
barred door, with its panels of oak and
studs of iron, remained betwixt them, a
tantalizing and inexorable barrier. At last.
Chance, always the good friend of those
who watch to avail themselves of the opportunities
which she presents, took the
guise of a north-east wind, which affected
Hans's wounded leg with as many aches
and twinges as Prospero inflicted upon
Caliban ; and visited the wife of his bosom,
Madame Klaus, with such a fit of rheumatic
gout, most aristocratic of diseases, as would
have done honour to a baroness of sixteen
quarters. Hans Klaus could not have
walked across the court to have exchanged
the warder's keys for a field-marshal's
baton ; and Dame Gertrude could not have
undone the easiest of the three padlocks to
have been made first lady of the key to
the empress. So they were forced to delegate

the office of bread-ands water carrier
to the young boy Wilhelm.

Max ! " " Agatha ! '' And the twin
brother and sister, for such they were, lay
bathed in tears of mingled joy and sorrow,
in each other's arms.

" How came you here ?" asked Agatha,
when their emotion had in part subsided ;
*^ You, Max von Lindorff, the King's Page,
the favourite, trusted and beloved almost
like a son ! What can have been your
offence ? How came you here ?"

I can as little guess the cause of this
imprisonment as you, sweet sister ! I
had served the King with wine the night
before, as he sate at supper with M. de
Voltaire and other gay and witty Frenchmen,
himself gayest of all. The next
morning Adolf von Eosenthal — Agatha,
I cannot see your blushes, but this trembling
hand tells of feelings which he
would be right glad to hear! Adolf

VOL. II. U

avowed his love, and craved my intercession;
and I was in the act, after one or
two attempts, of sealing a letter to yon,
when the officer on guard. Count "Waldemar,
entered my apartment, put me under
arrest, and whirled me off here to Spandau
without a moment's pause. As little as
yourself can I guess the cause. And now
let me ask of you the same question. How
came you hither, sister mine ?"

Agatha hesitated, and the little hand
which had before betrayed her consciousness
again trembled, as the brother pressed
it in his : '' The Baron von Eosenthal" —
she faltered ; and her brother filled up the
pause.

"Adolf! aye, doubtless, he ascertained
my destination from Count Waldemar, and
then communicated the intelligence to you.
No truer friend than Adolf von Eosenthal !
and yet I would not be sure that my calamity
was altogether unwelcome, since it

procured liii admission to his lady love.
But now, dearest, away ! Dally here no
longer ! leave the dungeon and the fortress
! lay aside your disguise"

*' Instantly, dear Max," interrupted she,
<sound>laughing</sound>, and beginning to divest herself
of cap and doublet, and to replace them
by her brother's habiliments : '^ Instantly !
we have not a moment to lose. It was for
this that I came ; I shall remain in the
cell, and you must pass for me, as, aided
by the dark wintry weather, and our remarkable
resemblance of figure, voice, and
face, and these, my boyish garments, you
well may do. "Walk boldly into Dame Gertrude's
apartments, and proffer to fetch
from her gossip, Claudius, the miller's
wife, the decoction of herbs, strange as
the compound of a witch's cauldron, which
she wants for her rheumatism. Once clear
of the walls of Spandau, make straight
for the frontier, and all will go well. No

u2

remonstrance, no hesitation, no delay.
This purse, too ; take this purse ! I shall
be safe, I tell you ; and when we shall
have found out your crime, there will be
some chance of proving a pardon. All
will be right, provided you be manageable !
Away with you, Max T' And, in spite of
contention and remonstrance, the brother
was forced away, and the sister remained
in his place, under a mixture of feelings
that found vent first in hysterical <sound>laughter</sound>,
then in hysterical <sound>sobs</sound>, and settled down
at last into a trembling <sound>silence</sound>, a breathless
pause of suspense and expectation,
during which she seemed to hear her own
heart beat, as she stood in the gloom and
darkness.

Gradually, however, she became aware
of <sound>sounds</sound>, the <sound>clang</sound> of gate and drawbridge,
the <sound>clattering</sound> of arms and trampling
of horses, which, piercing as they did
through the massive walls of the inner

couii:, indicated no common confusion in
the fortress ; so that when Klaus, accompanied
by a corporal's guard, made his appearance
in the doorway, she was, to a
certain degree, prepared for the discovery
of her scheme and the recapture of the prisoner.


The jailer, however, appeared still in a
state of mystification. ^^ I knew that I
should find Master Max safe in his apartments''
muttered Hans Klaus, with considerable
exultation. ^ ' My birds seldom get
out of their cages. Come along, can't you ?"
cried he, in a sharp voice, to the corporal,
as he swung along upon his crutches, with
an activity wholly belying the incapacity
of motion of which I spoke a few sentences
back, that extraordinary and preternatural
activity belonging to a lame man,
when the one motive, the key of the clock,
has been found, and the machinery has
been fairly set in motion. '^ Get on, I

tell you," cried the jailer to the corporal;
I knew that I should find him. A prisoner
escape from Spandau, indeed ! That
seems likely !"

Agatha had seen and heard enough to
take her measures. Max has been met
and stopped, and brought back, thought
she, and we are to be confronted. IS'ow
Heaven send him a good gift of impudence,
and surely that is a commodity in which a
court page can hardly be defective, and we
shall baffle them yet.

So thinking, she followed Klaus to the
guard-room, fully prepared to find that her
brother had been arrested, but a little disconcerted
to see seated in an arm-chair at
the head of the table, the identical adust,
stiff, soldier-looking personage, with his
cocked hat, jack-boots, and shabby unison,
known to his loving subjects as Frederick
the Great.

Here, an' please your Majesty," said

Klaus, pointing with his crutch to the
youth in his page's dress, whom he poked
forward as he spoke, '^ here is my prisoner,
Maximilian von Landor. The other boy
is, as I said before, a lad called Wilhelm
Steinfort, whom I and my old dame, waxing
somewhat stiff, have hired to scrub
down the courts, cut wood, and carry
water. He was only going some quarter
of a league for a decoction of"

'^ Bah ! " interrupted the King, " we
did not come here to inquire into thy wife's
rheumatism. Why, truly, Eosenthal, I
think there be two of them. Come hither,
master page."

Both youths advanced to the table.

I called Maximilian von Lindorff
only," added Frederick. '^ Which of you
answers to that name ? "

*^ I do," replied two <sound>voices</sound>, equally musical,
to the right and left.

'' Indeed! Who was your father ? "

'ernest von Lindorff, a Lieutenant-general
in your Majesty's service," answered
the two <sound>voices</sound> in duet.

'^^Hiat is your age? "

Seventeen the twentieth of last July,"
said both.

Which of ye is the real prisoner ?"

'^ I am," replied the two.

Wilhelm ! Wilhelm ! The boy is
crazy," interposed the jailer.

'hold your peace. Master Klaus," said
the King quickly ; " according to their own
confession, here was one prisoner upon the
point of escaping."

I am the prisoner," reiterated both.

Which of ye hath a sister, the Fraulein
Agatha?"

"I have!"

"Let me finish my sentence," quoth
his Majesty. "Don't be in such haste,
young Sirs, you are coming to your
sentence fast enough. And you, Master

Jailer, let me see no more winking and
nodding, and sign-making to the young
boy whom thou call'st "Wilhelm, but who
answers to the name of Max. Canst not
thou let him go to the gallows his own
way. Take care of thine own neck,
Master Klaus, which may be in jeopardy
here for playing fast and loose with thy
prisoners. Hearken, young Sirs," pursued
his Majesty, resuming the examination.
Which of ye hath a sister, the Fraulein
Agatha," — there he paused a moment, and
both were preparing to answer, '' I have ;"
the words were forming on each rosy
mouth ; when he continued deliberately —
who is in love with my aide-de-camp
here, the Baron Eosenthal ?"

The reply, which, as I have said, hung
trembling on either tongue, was suddenly
cut short as the one face covered with
blushes, after a shy stolen glance at the
fellow culprit's half amused, half sympathizing

countenance, seemed sinking
to the ground with shame; whilst
Eosenthal, provoked, astonished, and
confused, looked almost as guilty as the
prisoners.

The King went on with his questions.
You have such a sister, then, as the
young lady who is in love with the Baron ?
eh? Did you speak, my Lord?" said
Frederick, interrupting himself, as Essential,
vexed at heart for the vexation of his
blushing lady love, uttered an impatient
quirk behind the royal chair. '' Hum ! I
thought you wished to suggest some enquiry.
Monsieur le Baron. You did not,
you say ? Well ! then you have such a
sister as this Fraulein Agatha, the inamorato
of the Baron here ? And this leads
us to the crime, for crime it is," continued
Frederick, with a degree of seriousness
which communicated a corresponding degree
of apprehension to all who heard him.

*^ Do you know anything of this bit of
paper ?" asked he, sternly, producing from
his pocket a scrap of writing, of which the
top and the bottom and one comer seemed
to be torn off.

^^ Would you believe, gentlemen?" continued
the Majesty of Prussia, turning
rapidly from Major Kleinwitz to Baron
Eosenthal ; '' would you think it possible,
that the son of a brave soldier like Lin-doff,
who died in my arms, on the field of
battle — that his son, brought up in my
household, treated as a child of my own,
should write of me in terms like these ? —
in terms amounting to treason," added he,
waxing warmer as he described the guilt
of the culprit. " "Which of ye owns this
scroll ? Let none own it lightly, for it
will be found to contain no slight matter.
Bead it, Kleinwitz. I picked it up myself
under the boy's window at Potsdam. I

know the-writing well, having before now
employed the ingrate as my amanuensis.
Head."

He fixed his eyes on the culprits, who
listened with surprise and alarm as Klein-wits
read. Thus ran the scroll : —

So much for Rosenthal's petition,
sweet sister, which I pray you to answer
favourably. You cannot do otherwise, for
I know that you have long loved him. For
other matters we go on much as usual.
The tyrant"—

sphere," said Kleinwitz, 'some words
are missing, — ' got drubbed most famously
last night by' "

*^ And here some more. Sire," continued
Kleinwitz, compassionately; " this scrawl
is imperfect."

" Go on !" was the stem command.

May this country soon be rid of him."

That meaning is plain enough, Major

Kleinwitz. Is it not?" said the Monarch
coldly. " There is no riddle there. The
treason is plain and simple and so shall bethe
doom."

*' Suffer me to complete the sentence,"
said one of the culprits producing from
the page's dress a morsel of paper which
exactly fitted the scrawl in question.

Sister !" cried Max in great perplexity,
tugging at her sleeve — the sleeve of
his own doublet upon Agatha's arm ;
^^ Sister, for Heaven's sake ! better die !"

^^ Better live. Max !" returned his sister,
smiling. " I know what I'm about, and
the truth shall out, the truth, and the
whole truth. Max! Head, Major Klein-wits.
No, not that nonsense at the beginning,"
added she, with a renewal of the
shamefacedness which did so much injustice
to her page's attire.

'No need to read that nonsense ! Begin

there!" And the good natured commandant
read: —

u-yy-g gg|. Qj^ much as usual. The tyrant
of [literature Voltaire'] got drubbed last
night most unmercifully by [our good old
Fritz?] Be it ominous, and the country
soon rid of him [for everT]

'' Pardon, Sire, the impertinent expression
! It was a boy's flippancy, repented
as soon as written, torn away, and, as I
believe, destroyed. Pardon that impertinence,
and, above all, forgive her whose
only fault was a too deep love of her twin
brother. Pardon, Sire, I beseech thee."

" Did old Fritz give Voltaire a sound
drubbing, Max, in the match of wit we
played last night ? Good faith, I believe
he did 1" chuckled the King. " And thou
wilt be glad to be quit of him ! Well, if
that be the worst treason we meet with,
the fortress of Spandau may go empty.

Here is one fair prison-breaker though,"
added he, drawing Agatha gently towards
him, " and the best way to dispose of her
will be to give her her choice of warders,
Hans Klaus or Baron Rosenthal."

because she observes. Her dialogues are short, epigrammatic, and occasionally
brilliant encounters of wit, and a vein of good common sense runs

Diary And LETTERS

OF

MADAME D'ARBLAY,

ArTHOE OF "Evening," "CECILIA." &amp;c.

DfCXUDETG THE PERIOD OF

HER RESIDENCE AT THE COURT OF QUEEN CHARLOTTE.

In announcing a new and cheap edition of Madame D'Arblay's
celebrated Diary, the publishers cannot convey a better idea
of the nature of the work, to those who are unacquainted with
it, than by extracting the opening passage of Miss Burney's
Journal, which was commenced in 1768, and continued, with
but few interruptions, during the greater portion of the writer's
long and eventful life : —

To have some account of my thoughts, actions, and acquaintance, when
the hour arrives when time is more nimble than memory, is the reason which
induces me to keep a Journal — a Journal in thick I must confess my every
thought — mist open my whole heart"

"When we call to mind that the person who formed this resolution,
and adhered to it during the most important period of her
brilliant career, was one of the most remarkable and justly celebrated
women, not merely of her own, but of any time or country
that her family position, no less than her celebrity, commanded
for her an intimate intercourse with all who were illustrious in
English Literature and Art during their most illustrious era,
and that the results of such resolution are here given to the
world precisely as they left the hand of their writer (the omissions
required by personal and family considerations being alone
excepted), the interest this work must excite, can scarcely be
increased; yet it ought to be stated, that, shortly after the
publication of her second work, •' Cecilia," she was spontaneously
offered by Queen Charlotte a situation about her
Majesty's person, which brought her into daily intercourse with
every individual forming the Court of George III. During

this remarkable period of her life, IVIiss Burney never omitted
to note in her Journal such events and conversations of the
past day as she deemed worthy of record, and might be given
without any violation of confidence ; and these sketches of the
Court of George III. during the important era in question form
part of the work now announced.

The Correspondence, which takes its place chronologically
with the Diary, includes, besides a large number of Madame
D'Arblay's own Letters, a selection from those addressed to herby
the various distinguished literary and other persons with
whom she was intimate.

EDINBURGH REVIEW.

Madame D'Arblay lived to be a classic. Time set on her fame, before
she went hence, that seal which is seldom set except on the fame of the departed.
All those whom we have been accustomed to revere as intellectual
patriarchs seemed children when compared with her ; for Burke had sat up
all night to read her writings, and Johnson had pronounced her superior to
Fielding, when Rogers was still a schoolboy, and Southey still in petticoats.
Her Diary is written in her earliest and best manner ; in true woman's English,
clear, natural, and lively. It ought to be consulted by every person who
wishes to be well acquainted with the history of our literature and our
manners."

EMBELLISHED WITH PORTRAITS OF EVERY QUEEN,

BEAUTIFULLY ENGRAVED FROM THE MOST AUTHENTIC SOURCES.

In announcing a cheap Edition of this important and interesting
work, which has been considered unique in biographical
literature, the publishers again beg to direct attention to the
following extract from the author's preface : — " A revised
edition of the ' Lives of the Queens of England, embodying
the important collections which have been brought to light
since the appearance of earlier impressions, is now offered to
the world, embellished with Portraits of every Queen, from
authentic and properly verified sources. The series, commencing
with the consort of VVilham the Conqueror, occupies
that most interesting and important period of our national chronology,
from the death of the last monarch of the Anglo-saxon
line, Edward the Confessor, to the demise of the last sovereign
of the royal house of Stuart, Queen Anne, and comprises therein
thirty queens who have worn the crown-matrimonial, and four
the regal diadem of this realm. We have related the parentage
of every queen, described her education, traced the influence
of family connexions and national habits on her conduct, both
public and private, and given a concise outline of the domestic,
as well as the general history of her times, and its effects on
her character, and we have done so with singleness of heart,
unblessed by selfish interests or narrow views. Such as they
were in life we have endeavoured to portray them, both in

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

FROM THE TIMES.

These volumes have the fascination of romance united to the integrity of
history. The work is written by a lady of considerable learning, indefatigable
industry, and careful judgment. All these qualifications for a biographer and
an historian she has brought to bear upon the subject of her volumes, and from
them has resulted a narrative interesting to all, and more particularly interesting
to that portion of the community to whom the more refined researches of
literature afford pleasure and instruction. The whole work should be read,
and no doubt will be read, by all who are anxious for information. It is a lucid
arrangement of facts, derived from authentic sources, exhibiting a combination
of industry, learning, judgment, and impartiality, not often met with in biographers
of crowned heads."

Morning Herald.

A remarkable and truly great historical work. In this series of biographies,
in which the severe truth of history takes almost the wildness of romance, it is
the singular merit of Miss Strickland that her research has enabled her to throw
new Hight on many doubtful passages, to bring forth fresh facts, and to render
every portion of our annals which she has described an interesting and valuable
study. She has given a most valuable contribution to the history of England,
and we have no hesitation in affirming that no one can be said to possess an
accurate knowledge of the history of the country who has not studied this truly
national work, which, in this new edition, has received all the aids that further
research on the part of the author, and of embellishment on the part of the publishers,
could tend to make it still more valuable, and still more attractive, than
it had been in its original form,"

MORNING Chronicle.

A most valuable and entertaining work. There is certainly no lady of our
day who has devoted her pen to so beneficial a purpose as Miss Strickland. Nor
is there any other whose works possess a deeper or more enduring interest."

We must pronounce Miss Strickland beyond all comparison the most entertain

DIARY AND Correspondence OF

SAMUEL Pets, F.R.S.,

SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY IX THE REIGNS OF CHARLES II.
AND JAMES II.

EDITED BY RICHARD LORD BRAYBROOKE.

The authority of Pets, as an historian and illustrator of
a considerable portion of the seventeenth century, has been
so fully acknowledged by every scholar and critic, that it is
now scarcely necessary even to remind the reader of the advantages
he possessed for producing the most complete and
trustworthy record of events, and the most agreeable picture
of society and manners, to be found in the literature of any
nation. In confidential communication-vvith the reigning
sovereigns, holding high official employment, placed at the
head of the Scientific and Learned of a period remarkable
for intellectual impulse, mingling in every circle, and observing
everything and everybody whose characteristics were
worth noting down ; and possessing, moreover, an intelligence
peculiarly fitted for seizing the most graphic points in
whatever he attempted to delineate, Pepys may be considered
the most valuable as well as the most entertaining of our
National Historians.

A New Library Edition of this work, comprising aU the
restored passages and the additional annotations that have
been called for by the vast advances in antiquarian and historical
knowledge during the last twenty years, will doubtless
be regarded as one of the most agreeable additions that could
be made to the library of the general reader.

From THE Edinburgh REVIEW.

Without making any exception in favour of any other production
of ancient or modern diarists, we unhesitatingly characterise this journal
as the inmost remarkable production of its kind which has ever been
given to the world. Pepys' Diary makes us comprehend the great
historical events of the age, and the people who bore a part in them,
and gives us more clear glimpses into the true English life of the times
than all the other memorials of them that have come down to our own."

FROM THE QUARTERLY REVIEW.

There is much in Pepys' Diary that throws a distinct and vivid
light over the picture of England and its government during the period
succeeding the Restoration. If, quitting the broad path of history, we
look for minute information concerning ancient manners and customs,
the progress of arts and sciences, and the various branches of antiquity,
we have never seen a mine so rich as these volumes. The variety of
Pepys' tastes and pursuits led him into almost every department of
life. He was a man of business, a man of information, a man of whim,
and, to a certain degree, a man of pleasure. He was a statesman, a
bel esprit, a virtuoso, and a connoisseur. His curiosity made him an
unwearied, as well as an universal, learner, and whatever he saw found
its way into his tablets."

FROM THE Athenaeum.

"The best book of its kind in the English language. The new
matter is extremely curious, and occasionally far more characteristic
and entertaining than the old. The writer is seen in a clearer light,
and the reader is taken into his inmost soul. Pepys' Diary is the ablest
picture of the age in which the writer lived, and a work of standard importance
in EngUsh literature."

FROM THE Examiner.

We place a high value on Pepys' Diary as the richest and most
delightful contribution ever made to the history of English life and
manners in the latter half of the seventeenth century."

FROM TAIT's magazine.

"We owe Pepys a debt of gratitude for the rare and curious information
he has bequeathed to us in this most amusing and interesting work.
His Diary is valuable, as depicting to us many of the most important
characters of the times. Its author has bequeathed to us the records of
his heart — the very reflection of his energetic mind ; and his quaint but
happy narrative clears up numerous disputed points— throws light into
many of the dark comers of history, and lays bare the hidden substratum
of events which gave birth to, and supported the visible progress of, the
nation."

FROM THE MORNING POST.

Of aU the records that have ever been published, Pepys' Diary
gives us the most vivid and trustworthy picture of the times, and the
clearest view of the state of English public affairs and of English
society during the reign of Charles 11. We see there, as in a map,
the vices of the monarch, the intrigues of the Cabinet, the wanton follies
of the court, and the many calamities to which the nation was subjected
during the memorable period of fire, plague, and general licentiousness."

which may be had separately), price 6s. each, handsomely bound,

COMPRISING ALL THE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL NOTES, LETTERS, AND OTHER
ILLUSTRATIONS LAST aide.

We rejoice to welcome this beautiful and compact edition of Evelyn. It is
intended as a companion to the recent edition of Pepys, and presents similar claims
to interest and notice. Evelyn was greatly above the vast majority of his contemporaries,
and the Diary which records the incidents in his long life, extending
over the greater part of a century, is deservedly esteemed one of the most interesting
books in the language. Evelyn took part in the breaking out of the civil
war against Charles L, and he lived to see William of Orange ascend the throne.
Through the days of Strafford and Laud, to those of Bancroft and Ken, he
was the steady friend of moderation and peace in the EngUsh Church. He
interceded alike for the royalist and the regicide ; he was the correspondent of
Cowley, the patron of Jeremy Taylor, the associate and fellow-student of Boyle ;
and over all the interval between Vandyke and Kneller, between the youth of
Milton and the old age of Dryden, poetry and the arts found him an intelligent
adviser, and a cordial friend. There are, on the whole, very few men of whom
England has more reason to be proud. He stands among the first m the list of

Lies OF THE PRINCESSES OF ENGLAND.

By MRS. EVERETT GREEN,

EDITOR OF THE " LETTERS OF ROYAL AND ILLUSTRIOUS LADIES."

5 vols., post 8vo, with Illustrations, 10s. 6d. each, bound**
One Volume more will complete the Series.

This work is a worthy companion to Miss Strickland's admirable ' Queens
of England.' That celebrated work, although its heroines were, for the most
part, foreign Princesses, related almost entirely to the history of this country.
The Princesses of England, on the contrary, are themselves English, but their
lives are nearly all connected with foreign nations. Their biographies, consequently,
afford us a glimpse of the manners and customs of the chief European
kingdoms, a circumstance which not only gives to the work the charm of vanity,
but which is likely to render it peculiarly useful to the general reader, as it links
together by association the contemporaneous history of various nations. We
cordially commend Mrs. Green's production to general attention ; it is (necessarily)
as useful as history, and fully as entertaining as romance"— &lt;Sww.

The best genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage,
and the first authority on all questions affecting the aristocracy." — Ghhe.

For the amazing quantity of personal and family history, admirable arrangement
of details, and accuracy of information, this genealogical and heraldic
dictionary is without a rival. It is now the standard and acknowledged book of
reference upon all questions touching pedigree, and direct or collateral affinity
with the titled aristocracy. The lineage of each distinguished house is deduced
through all the various ramifications. Every collateral branch, however remotely
connected, is introduced ; and the alliances are so carefully inserted, as to show,
in all instances, the connexion which so intimately exists between the titled and
untitled aristocracy. We have also much most entertaining historical matter,
and many very curious and interesting family traditions. The work is, in fact, a
complete encyclopaedia of the whole titled classes of the empire, supplying all the
information that can possibly be desired on the subject." — Morning Post.

EXTINCT, DORMANT, AND ABEYANT Peerage

OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND.

Beautifully printed, in 1 vol. 8vo, containing 800 double-column pages,
21s. bound.

This work connects, in many instances, the new with the old nobility, and it
will in all cases show the cause which has influenced the revival of an extinct
dignity in a new creation. It should be particularly noticed, that this new work
appertains nearly as much to extant as to extinct persons of distinction; for
though dignities pass away, it rarely occurs that whole families do.

FORTUNE: A STORY OF LONDON LIFE.

By D. T. Cotton, Esq.

will attract all readers. In every sense of the word, ' Fortune ' is an excellent

' Fortune' is not a romance, but a novel. All is reality about it: the time,
the characters, and the incidents. In its reality consists its charm and its
merit. It is, indeed, an extraordinary work, and has introduced to the world

THE Ploughing MATCH.

To hold the plough for her sweet love.

Shakespeare.

A PLEASANT and a stirring scene was the
barn-yard of Farmer Holden of Hilton,
one of the principal tenants of our friend
Colonel Lisle of that ilk (if it be permitted
to a Southron to borrow that expressive
phrase), on one of t]. 3 pleasantness and
sunniest evenings of this last most sunny
month of April, when, as if to overset all
the calculations of all the almanac-makers
from Mr. Murphy downward, and in direct

VOL. III. B

defiance of those safer general prognostic
derived from old experience, there has not
fallen in this fair county of Berks, from
the first to the thirtieth, one single drop
of rain. A bright and a lively scene did
the barn-yard of Hilton Great Farm
exhibit on that bright April evening.
Seen between the large wheat-ricks and
bean-stacks and hay-ricks, the beams and
stables, the cart-horses, hen-houses, and
pig-sties, which, together with the old-fashioned
rambling dwelling-house, large
enough to form two or three fine cottage-omnes
in these degenerate days ; seen
between the various buildings which withall
conceivable irregularity surrounded the
spacious farm-yard, glittering with the
clean crisp covering of straw with which
it was very literally littered, and giving
due token of their presence by bleating
of lambs seeking their mothers, and ewes
in pursuit of their lambs, by <sound>barking</sound> of

dogs and <sound>shouting</sound> of men and boys, were
the fine flocks of Farmer Holden returning
from their distant pastures to the fold ina
rich meadow near the homestead ; horses
mounted by young carter-boys sitting
longingly upon their naked backs, and
riding them to and from the village pond
with an indescribable air of lazy pride ;
whilst cows, driven by urchins on foot
somewhat brisker, but every whit as
dirty, stumbled amongst the sheep and
jostled the horses in their haste to reach
the calves, who were lowing in their pens
eager for the moment that should at once
appease their own " pleasant enemy
Hunger," and relieve the " mothers of
the herd" of their milky burthen.

Mingled with these larger comers and
goers, biped and quadruped, together with
occasional-passers-by, as the thresher or
the seedsman flung himself heavily over
the threshold of the bam, or the ploughman
stalked from the stable to the hays

2

rick, were innumerable lesser denizens of
this well-peopled agricultural demesne.
Pigs of all ages and all sizes lay wallowing
about the yard ; and poultry of every denomination,
from geese and turkeys to bantams
and pigeons, cackled at the barn-doors,
dabbled in the ponds, fluttered discontented
in the coops, or perched in happy freedom
on the roofs of the different buildings
; whilst one or two small and pretty
children, one Tvith a kitten in his hand,
leaning over the low hatch gate which
extended from side to side of the deep old
porch, as if longing to escape from this
their own peculiar coop, added to the
general agreeableness of the picture.
Sweetbread in its tender green and its
fresh fragrance grew on one side of that
old dark porch, and an early honeysuckle,
already putting forth its bud, flourished
on the other. July-stocks, wall-flowers,
and polyanthuses, sent their sweet <sound>breath</sound>
through the lattice windows divided by

rich stone scullions ; a large clierrv-treo
waved its snowy blossoms, scattering light
at one end of the house, backed by a rich
rosy-tinted, almond scented, orchard, whilst
in a nook between a dark fagot-x:)ile and a
huge open cart-house, the sun glanced
upwards on an old elder-tree, turning the
trunk into gold, and the wide-spreading
branches drooping with the weight of the
redundant foliage, and the swelling flower-buds
into pendant emeralds ; the clouds
vv'ere white and fleecy, the sky of the
brightest and purest blue, and the woody
uplands which formed the framework of
the scenery full of hedge-row timber just
putting forth its youngest and most delicate
" green."

A gay and a pretty picture was that
crowded farm-yard, and yet the two principal
figures still remain described.
Seated upon a low wooden stool, engaged
in the operation of administering certain

small pellets of dough to some threescore
of callow, gaping, struggling goslings —
(in the pure Doric of Berkshire this operation
is called " pilling the gulls") — was a
young woman of middle height, whose
person, sufficiently well formed but somewhat
large-boned and muscular, betokened
such an union of activity and strength as
might probably be more common in the
weaker sex if the bountiful intentions of
Mature were duly seconded by education
and circumstance — if girls took more
exercise and passed more time in the open
air. Her face could hardly be called
pretty, far less beautiful ; and yet in the
bright <sound>laughing</sound> eyes, the red lips just
enough divided to show the pearly teeth,
and a dimple on one corner of the mouth,
the clear healthy sunburnt complexion,
and an expression compounded of frankness,
sweetness, and gaiety, there was
more of charm than is often to be found

in the most regular beauty. And so in
good truth thought her companion.

She from her occupation and her dress,
her dark cotton gown, her double muslin
handkerchief, her simple cap, as well as
the sleeves turned up above her elbows
and the coloured apron tied over the white
one, was evidently a farm-house sen-handmaiden
just tidied up after going through
the most laborious of her many offices j
and finishing her day's work by supplying
the manifold wants of her feathered
charges, and milking the kine, if indeed
the calves did not spare her the trouble.
He a fine-looking young man, rather tall
than short, but firmly and rigorously
formed, with a bright open countenance
and a glowing complexion, was as evidently
a fanner's son. His straw hat was
placed rather on one side on his glossy
auburn curls, with the true air of a village
beau, and his dark velveteen jacket and

the silk handkerchief just knotted round
his throat, had as much of real study in
the apparent carelessness of their adjustment
as would have done honour to the
veriest coxcomb of one-and-twenty that
ever danced at Alack's — personal vanity
being astonishingly alike in all stations.
A coxcomb, I grieve to say, was Maurice
Elliott, and yet, being heartily in love, he
had the best chance that could befall him
of getting rid of his coxcombry. At present,
however, to judge of the dialogue
passing between them, their ^^ course of
ti'ue love" was very far from running
smooth." It was more like a game of
cross purposes than a meeting at sunset
between two lovers.

'^ You won't go with me, then, to the
Maying, Phoebe ?" said the youth impatiently,
twisting round his fingers a long
supple branch which he had just twitched
from a <sound>weeping</sound> willow that overhung the

goose-pond, never dreaming the while that
he was, so far as action went, emulating
one of the most eloquent women that ever
graced blue stockings. "You won't go
with me to the Maying ?"

^^ You won't try for a prize at the ,
Maurice ? You really won't
thy ? really and indeed you won't ?" rejoined
the damsel, poking one of her pellets
with a little stick down a gosling's throat,
and following the dose by a drop or two of
water to clear the passage for another
morsel. '^Do try, Maurice I" continued
she in a tone of voice sweet and round and
youthful, — a spoken smile. " Do try !"

"When I know," cried Maurice, still
twisting the unlucky bit of willow, " that
you have got leave to go out that very day !
Of course to the Maying ! and not to go
with me !" And Maurice gave the bit of
willow which he twisted round his finger
such a tug with his other hand as had

nearly cut that useful member to the bone.
^*Got leave to go, and won't go with
me!"

" Ashen you won't try at the plough" —

Hang the ploughing-match !" ejaculated
Maurice, shaking his discomfited
finger ; '' hang the ploughing-match !"

" "Wien you won't try for a prize," continued
Phoebe, quietly taking another gosling
upon her lap, "you who know that
you can plough as straight a furrow as old
Giles Dowling: himself I"

" Hang Giles Howling, Phoebe ! My
father was a farmer, and though, to please
him, and since his death to humour mother,
I may have gone between the stilts, there's
no need to let myseK down iu the eyes of
the whole parish. What would that cold,
sneering, purse-proud, uncle of mine and
his fine daughters say, I wonder ? Come,
Phoebe, don't look so grave — you '11 go to
the Maying, won't you? That can hinder

you, now that you have got leave ? Come,
and I'll drive you in my own chaise-cart
with my new chesnut horse."

"What would your proud uncle and
your fine cousins say to that I wonder ?
You are a farmer's son, as you truly say,
Mr. Maurice Elliott, and I am a labourer's
daughter. God forbid that I should be
ashamed of being the child of an honest
man, let his condition be ever so poor! "
and Phoebe, though her tone was gentle,
drew her stool a little back with an air of
self-respect that approached to dignity.

Her lover felt the reproof.

Forgive me, dearest Phoebe ! pray,
pray forgive me ! I did not intend — I did
not dream — oh ! Phoebe, I never think of
you but as one so much better than
myself ! You do forgive me then ?" said
he, answering the bright dimpled smile
which required no words to confirm her
pardon. " You do forgive me, and you '11

let me drive you to this Maying ? Weare
to have a cricket-match and a dance,
and it will be so pretty a sight ! Why do
you shake your head ? Is there any
secret in the matter'"

'' 'No secret at all, Maurice," said Phoebe.
"I'll tell you the truth; you'll not be
ashamed of it, though your fine cousins
would. Poor uncle George has been so ill
this spring that he has not been able to
get his allotment dug or planted, and you
know the allotment ground is his chief
dependence. The child-en would be half
starved without the vegetables, and the
refuse keeps the pig. So father and
mother are going to give him a day's
labour to get in the potatoes, and I'm going
to help. That's my holy day, and a very
happy one it will be. Uncle George was
always so good to me, and so was aunt,
and I love the children dearly. You '11
see what a day's work I shall do."

Dear, good Phoebe ! I wish I could
help too ; only I have promised to make
one of the eleven, and I can't desert them
just at last. But I'll tell you what I can
do. Your little cousin George, who lives
with us, I can let him go home and help."

Another bright smile repaid the kindness.


But this ploughing-match, Maurice !
that will be a pretty sight too ! And you,
who can do everything better than the
other lads of the parish, why should not
you be as proud of being the best ploughman
as the best cricketer or the best shot?
Kay, but you must listen to me, Maurice:
whatever the purse-proud uncle or the fine
cousins may say, I have good cause to believe
that your trying for the prize would
please one person besides myself — you'
own good landlord, Colonel Lisle''

Maurice's brow darkened. He drew up
his person to his full stature and spoke
angrily and bitterly —

" My own good landlord ! Would you
believe, Phoebe, that after living upon his
estate, I and my fathers, these three hundred
years and more, paying his rent to a
day, and doing as much justice to his land
as if it were really our own, this good landlord
of ours, the lease being upon the point
of expiring, has sent us notice to quit ?
actually sent us notice to quit I" He
turned away in proud and angry sorrow.

Notice ! but has any one taken the
farm ?" inquired Phoebe.

Not yet, I fancy ; but he will find no
difficulty in letting it. The lands lie close
to my uncle's, and I have sometimes
thought — at all events we have notice."

'' But for what reason ?"

^* Oh ! your rich landlord can easily find
a reason for ridding himself of a poor
tenant. The message was civil enough as
regarded mother. If she had wished to
remain in the farm he would have had no

objection; but, as ber request was that
the lease might be renewed in my favourite
could not comply. I was unfit for a
farmer, be said ; never in my business,
always shooting, or coursing, or cricketing;
never at home; never attending to the
main chance ; unthrifty in everything ;
and about, he heard'' and then, suddenly,
Maurice Elliott checked himself,
and paused.

^^ About to marry a poor girl without a
farthing, when you might have married
your cousin Harriet with more money
than I know how to reckon. Oh ! Maurice !
Maurice ! little did I think when your
own dear mother gave her consent, because
I was active and industrious and an honest
man's daughter, and because the son she
loved so well loved me, little did I think
that she would be turned from her home
for that great goodness. But it must not
be, dear Maurice ! We must part ! We

must not marry, to have your mother
turned out of doors ; neither of us would
be happy so. I can speak to my mistress
she is so very kind — and go to live with
her friends a great way off. And you will
give up coursing and shooting (you know
you have promised me to do that), and
then, when Colonel Lisle finds that your
heart is in your business, all will go right,
and you will stay at the Linden Farm,
and we shall be happy." — And by way of
earnest of this coming felicity, poor Phoebe
<sound>burst</sound> into a violent fit of <sound>sobbing</sound>.

Maurice exhausted himself in protestations
— to do him justice, most sincere — of
love, everlasting love, to Phoebe, and
hatred, equally durable and equally sincere,
towards uncle, cousin, landlord, and.
in short, all who sought to separate him
from his beloved ; assuring her that Colonel
Lisle' s whole estate would not bribe
him to renounce his engagement ; that, go

where she might, he would follow; and
that, so far from desiring to coutiiiue at
their old home, nothing would induce him
to remain the tenant of a landlord so unjust
and despotic, one who had condemned,
without hearing, the descendant
of a race who had lived under his father
and his father's fathers — ay, even fi'om
the planting of the great lime-trees which
gave their name to the farm. But if
Maurice was vehement, Phoebe, whose
hysterical <sound>sobbing</sound> had ended in <sound>quiet</sound> and
relieving tears, continued gently firm.

*' You would not make me wretched,
Maurice ; I know that you would not ;
and how could I be otherwise if I were to
cause you' ruin? I shall go into Kent, to
Mrs. Holden's sister, and Colonel Lisle
will think better than to dismiss the son
of his old tenant. Go to him, dear Maurice
! Speak to him yourself ! Explain
— ''

VOL. III. c

Go to him, indeed ! Speak to him !
Explain ! I can tell you, Phoebe, that he
must come to me if he wishes me to stay
upon his land. There are other farms in
the county beside his. We are no bond-slaves,
blessed be God ! in merry England.
But don't you go, Phoebe ! Stay and let
me tell you of my plans ; or, if you must
go, promise at least to see me, and to give
me a full hearing, before you leave Hilton.
Promise me this. Stay at least till this
ploughing-match is over. That will be a
holiday far and near. See me then, and I
will let this dear hand go."

And Phoebe, blushing, <sound>sighing</sound>, and
protesting against a meeting which would
only be a renewal of pain, did, however,
give the required promise ; and the lovers
parted — she for her in-door duties, he for
the home he was soon to relinquish.

They who witness those pretty rural
festivals, with all their picturesque accessories

of tent and marquee, banners and
bands, gay and happy crowds, shaded by
noble trees and lighted by bright sunshine,
and fanned by the sweet airs of the fairest
of the seasons ; or they who read the elaborate
account of the day's proceedings
in the county newspapers, where all is
chronicled, en couleur de rose fi'oni the
earliest procession to the latest cheer, little
guess the trouble, and turmoil, and tracasseries
which this apparently most amicable,
and peaceful celebration occasions in
its district. The ostensible competitors,
whose province is to contend for the prizes,
are for the most part (the winners being
satisfied, of course, and the losers soothed
and comforted by encouraging speeches
and a good dinner, — solid pudding added
to empty praise) as good-humoured and
contented as heart can desire; their unlucky
patrons and protectors, the Association,
in its own proper person, having pre

2

piously gone through as much fussing and
disputing, squabbling and quarrelling, as
would carry a candidate through a county
election, or produce a tragedy upon the
boards of a theatre-royal.

One committee-man threatened to resign
because he was not a vice-president ;
and one vice-president did send in his
resignation because he was not the president.
One very great man (an Earl), applied
to to assume that high oflQ.ce, never
answered the secretary's letter; and another
great man (a Viscount), coquetted,
and cooled, and showed, and finally declined,
because the Earl had been written
to first. The committee had five meets
kings, to consider of the place where they
ought to meet ; four to consider of the day
of celebration; three of the hour of dinner;
and the grand question of in doors or out of
doors, marquee or barn, very nearly caused
a dissolution of the society ; party having

run so high that two of the members, after
scolding themselves hoarse, arrived at
that state of dumb resentment which au"
sewers to the white heat of the anvil, and
did not speak. They quarrelled about the
value of the clothes, about the devices of
the banners, about the colours of the cockades,
— in short, there was nothing which
admitted of two opinions about which
they did not quarrel; so that the chief
dignitaries of the association, the chairman,
treasurer, and secretary, who had
endeavoured to add to their several offices
that of pacificators-general, declared that
all the ploughmen and all their teams
would not work half as hard on the day of
trial as they had done during the time of
preparation.

But if this spirit of opposition, for opposition's
sake, be a little too much the
fashion in our free country, where the
good yeoman who subscribes his five shillings

claims " a voice potential, as double
as the duke's," who lays down his twenty
pounds, (and that the facts arc little exaggerated
will be readily admitted by
most who have been behind the scenes in
such societies,) so let me proudly say the
ill-humour, having once found a vent,
works itself clear, and the rough, burly
disputants come round again, shake hands,
and hear reason, with a readiness and
facility just as characteristic of our national
manners, where a squabble once
over is over for ever, and a quarrel fairly
reconciled only leaves the opponents faster
friends than before. Accordingly, by the
time the appointed day arrived all was
peace, and amity, and joyous bustle, and
the scene took its usual cordial and hearty
character of a meeting calculated to advance
the interests and promote the happiness
of all classes.

Some weeks had elapsed since the

dialogue between the lovers in Farmer
Holden's barn-yard, and reports were rife
in the village of a strange change in the
fortunes of the young tenant of the Linden
Farm. His father's will, it was said, threw
him entirely into the power of his hardhearted
and puisse-proud uncle, Stephen Elliott.
There were different versions of the
story, and no one spoke as of positive
knowledge ; but one fact seemed certain,
that Maurice's negociation for a farm of
the same extent with that which he now
occupied, had been cut short by the intervention
of his stern relative, and that he
was now seeking to rent a few acres of
pasture-land attached to a cottage in the
Moors. He and Phoebe had not met; but,
pursuant to her promise, she had not left
Hilton, and was now dressing for the
ploughing-match at her mother's cottage,
with a feeling of lightheartedness for
which she would have found it difficult to

account. Was she — could she be conscious
that her lover's gaze was fixed
upon her through the open door ? or was
the knowledge that he was no longer the
rich, and, to use the country phrase, the
somewhat prodigal young farmer, but
nearer her own level, brightening her
eyes, and glowing in her cheek, with a
hope unacknowledged even to her own
heart ? Or did she give more credit
than she thought she did to the report
of her little cousin George, that he and
his master were, after all, to try for the
prizes at the ploughing-match ? Phoebe
knew that Stephen Elliott had said, with
his scornful sneer and bitter tone, '^ Let
him try for the suit of clothes — he may
want 'cm !" and Phoebe knew enough of
her lover's temper to feel that this very
taunt, uttered to keep him from the scene,
was likely to take a different effect upon
his high spirit. " At all events," thought

she, " I shall see him ! " and she dressed
herself in a flutter of spirits, with
which vanity had little to do, and then
sat down quietly to await her father,
whom she was to accompany, and to whom
the first prize was allotted, as having
brought up a large family in credit and
respectability, without receiving parochial
assistance. The hale old man, in his well-preserved
Sunday coat, with his grey hair
smoothed down over his honest face,
and his pretty daughter hanging upon
Ms arm, as they walked on the ground
after the match was over, formed one of
the most interesting groups of the day.

The scene was really beautiful. Upon
an extensive lawn, richly dotted with
magnificent trees, and backed by a noble
mansion embowered in woods, stood a
splendid central marquee, with smaller
tents on either side ; flags and banners
waved round the tents, and crowned the

lofty decorated building arched with lilacs
and labumams, where the gentlemen were
to dine; and the large, low, open cart-house,
overhung by a down-hanging elm,
prepared for the ploughmen ; carnages
were driven up in close succession, horses
prancing, music playing, and (to borrow
the words of the County Chronicle) all the
beauty and fashion of the neighbourhood
were collected in front of the tents to
witness the distribution of the prizes, and,
best of all, they who had earned those
prizes, and sturdy tillers of the soil, clean,
healthy, and happy, their delighted wives
and daughters, and the stout yeomen their
masters, triumphing in the success of
their labourers. Add to this the lucky
accident of a sunny day in the most
genial of the seasons, and every advantage
of light, and shadow, and shifting
clouds, and the result will be a scene too
wide for the painter, but rich, and bright.

and joyous as ever inspired a poet in the
merry month of May.

Phoebe looked only for one figure, — and
there, dressed like the rest of the competitors
in a white smock-frock, his head
decked with a double cockade, as winter
not only of the regular match, but of a subsequent
prize for ploughing with two horses,
stood Maurice Elliott, and close beside
him her little cousin George, sticking his
hat, also doubly cockaded, as high as
possible upon his head, and fairly standing
on tiptoe, that his honours might be
more conspicuous. IN'ear him, so placed
as to appear to belong rather to the gentry
than to the wealthy yeomen, in which
order he was really classed, leaned his
uncle Stephen, his accustomed scornful
sneer darkened as if by stronger passions.

The ceremony and its attendant speeches
being over. Colonel Lisle approached
Phoebe and her father, now also wearing

the decorations of the day, and joined by
little George, and, patting the boy's cheek,
he said graciously to the old man, " Why,
you and your nephew are carrying ois all
our prizes."

"Add his son-in-law, if you please.
Sir," said Maurice Elliott, approaching the
group, holding in one hand the hat decked
with its blue cockades of success, and
shaking hands heartily with the grey-headed
and venerable old peasant : " Add
his son-in-law ; for such I shall be as soon
as the banns can be published, for I have
no money now to throw away upon a
licence. All is settled," continued he ina
lower tone to the old man ; " Phoebe
consented as soon as ever I proved to her
that not only my happiness but my prosperity
depended upon my marrying such
a wife as herself — pooh ! as soon as I
proved that my happiness depended upon
my marrying her — for there is not such

another in the world ; and Joseph Clarkson,
finding that I am to have her to
manage the dairy, has consented to let me
rent his thirty acres domi in the Moors,
and the little homestead belonging to it.
There 's a capital garden ; and during my
spare time I shall raise vegetables for the
Belford market, and mother '11 live nth
ns ; and you '11 see how happy we shall
be !" And happiness danced in the young
man's eyes as, again wringing the old
labourer's hand, he turned away to join
his Phoebe.

" Stop I" exclaimed Colonel Lisle, who,
irresistibly attracted by the sudden alteration
in his tenant's manner and conduct,
had been unable to refrain from listening
to the conversation — " Stop one moment,
Maurice Elliott," said he, kindly; "and
tell me what this means I — Joseph Clarkson's
land in the Moors ! and your mother
to live with you there ! Why, in lea\Tiig

the Linden, there Avill be the stock, and
the crops, and the farming utensils,
enough, whether you retain or dispose of
them, to set you up in one of the best farms
in the county. All was left, I know, to
you and your mother. Surely you have
not, since your father's death, involved
yourself in such a debt as to render this
change of situation necessary ?"

" I owe no man a farthing. Sir," replied
Maurice, with some pride of accent
and manner : then, catching the kindly
glance of his landlord, he continued,
mildly and respectfully, " Everything was
left to my mother and myself; but, either
by accident or design — I believe — I am
sure by accident — the will is so worded,
that although, in case of our continuing
at the Linden Farm, the stock and property
of every sort were to remain for my
use, upon paying a small annuity to my
mother, yet, if we removed, it appears

that the whole is to be sold ; the money
to be invested in the 3 per cents., and not
to be touched either by her or me until
her death — neither of lis receiving any
benefit from this sum beyond the yearly
payment of her annuity — which, Heaven
grant, may continue for many years !"

'^ This is new to me, Maurice, and
strange as well as new. "Who is the
executor ?"

"Mr. Stephen Elliott, my uncle."
'^ Humph ! — your uncle! Have you
seen the will ? Has any lawyer seen it ?
Your uncle, Mr. Stephen Elliott, is the
executor, you say ? Is the will in your
father's hand writing ?"

IS'o, Sir ; in that of Mr. Ball."
'the little pettifogging lawyer, of
Bewley — a man thirty miles off — Stephen
Elliott's factotum : I thought so. Well !
we must get some one learned in the law
to look over it. ISTot to touch the money

till after your mother's death ! — That
could never have been the design of the
testator, however well it might meet the

views of . This must be looked to,

Maurice : send me a copy of the will."

" You are very good. Sir'' replied
Maurice, firmly ; ^^ but, with all gratitude
for you* kindness, I have made up my
mind to let the matter rest. Firmly as I
believe that my father did not contemplate
this state of things — that he never dreamt
of oiu' leaving the Linden Farm, it is
nevertheless so set down ; and there is
something in contesting the last will of a
parent which I cannot endure. Besides,
we shall do very well. My mother will
have the comforts to which she has been
accustomed, if my labour can provide
them ; and it will be better for me to bea
working-man. I was getting to like
sporting better than farming. Phoebe said
so, Sii*, as well as you. But now all that

is out of the question. I can work, as I
have proved to her ; and, with her for a
companion and a reward, I shall be a happier
man at the Moors than I should have
been in our old house, well as I love it."

Better and happier perhaps than you
might have been, had this not occurred,"
replied Colonel Lisle, grasping his young
tenant's hand with a pressure full of heart ;
but not better or happier than you will
be there now. The new lease shall be
made out tomorrow. Your uncle, for
views of his own, and in revenge for your
refusal of his daughter, represented you tome
as dissipated, idle, extravagant, and
careless of all except the caprice of the
hour. He even contrived to turn your
love for Phoebe into a proof of the lowness
of your mind and degradation of your
habits. Under this view I sent the notice,
fully intending however, especially after I
found that he wanted the farm, to examine

VOL. III. D

more closely into the facts. I ought to
have looked into the matter at once ; but
I can hardly regret not hasting done so,
since the experiment has not only made
your character better known to me, but to
yourself. And noah you must introduce
me to Phoebe ! There she stands, looking
at us ; — no ! now that she sees that weare
looking at her, she turns away, blushing.
But that is Phoebe ! — I should know
the fresh, innocent smile among a thousand.


And, as a lover of all justice — even that
shadowy justice called poetical, which is
the branch over which we poor authors
have most control — I must add, that,
whilst Phoebe's smiles gi'ew sweeter and
sweeter, as her blushes deepened, Stephen
Elliott, the rich and purse-proud uncle,
who had crept stealthily within hearing of
the conversation, and felt himself detected
and defeated, slunk away, hanging down

this head, pale with impotent malice, and
muttering ineffectual curses, the most contemned
and miserable wretch of that large
assembly.

D 2

Ts this our foeman's face ? Ah, no ! no ! no !"

Shakspeare.

A FAIRER damsel never graced the
pinched coif and demure kerchief of the
puritans than Mabel Goodwin, as she stood,
one sultry afternoon in the deity month
of June, wreathing a straggling honeysuckle
round a mossy sundial in the
desei-ted pleasaunce of Temple Waltham.
The scene of its accessories were not unworthy
of the blooming maiden, a very
rose-bud for beauty and youthfulness,

whose swift and airy motions seemed to
throw light and sunshine over the picture ;
and yet there was a strange contrast between
her bright and beaming loveliness
and the neglect and desolation of all
around.

The magnificent mansion, one of the
spacious and picturesque manor houses of
Elizabeth's days, erected, as the name
would import, upon the site of a still more
extensive residence or preceptory of the
proud order of St. John of Jerusalem, had
been shut up since the establishment of
the commonwealth; its former possessor.
Sir Philip llontresor, a staunch old cavalier,
having been in exile since the star of
Cromwell had been in the ascendant ; and
Colonel Goodwin, in virtue of a decree of
the committee of sequestration, its present
owner, a plain soldier and a zealous roundhead,
rigid, self-denying, and averse from
luxury as the Protector himself, preferring

the humble dwelling of his forefathers,
the home of his boyhood, to the splendid
abode of the royal favourite.

Desolated it was, with its barred
windows, its <sound>silent</sound> courts, the grass growing
on its noble terraces, the statues and
urns that crowned the marble balustrades
broken and overthrown, nettles and briars
forcing their way between the broad flights
of steps, wall-flowers and snap-dragons
flourishing in every nook of the richly
carved stone mullions. Desolation triumphed
over all ; and yet so picturesque
was the building, with its elaborate variety
of outline, its pointed roofs and gable ends
and clustered chimneys, its turrets and
porches and pinnacles, its deep bay
windows and projecting oriels, the play
of light and shadow, and the mellow tinting
of the weather-stained walls, and it is
doubtful if a painter's eye would not have
found more gratification in contemplating

the mansion, <sound>silent</sound> and deserted as it was,
a model of the poetical architecture of an
age when that grandest of the arts had not
yet subsided into dull prose, than to have
gazed on its spacious courts, crowded with
knight and squire, groom and page, with
stately dames and mincing damsels, on
that day for ever memorable in the annals
of the ^Montresors, when the Virgin Queen,
in one of her progresses, deigned not only
to sleep a night at Temple Laleham, but
even to dance a coranto with its master.

If the hall were still fair to the sight,
the park, or rather chase in which it stood,
presented a scene of unrivalled beauty.
Clumps of oaks and beeches, old enough to
have witnessed the stern and warlike exercises,
and to have listened to the choral
hymns of the Knights Templar; an
avenue of elms, above a mile in length,
pillared and arched like the aisle of some
mighty cathedral ; thickets of old thorns

covered with pearly blossoms, mingled with
the paler foliage of the feathery birch,
rising from an undergrowth of fern,
amongst which the deer were lying in scattered
groups, whilst large herds were grazing
upon the rich herbage, approaching
close to the mansion, as conscious that
they had little to fear from the intrusion
of man ; a piece of water that might almost
be called a lake, piercing the depth of the
woods, and giving back in its bright mirror
the rich and varied forest scenery, and the
light and fleecy cloudlets of the summer
sky ; a ruined tower on an eminence upon
the other side of the mere, whose walls,
covered with ivy, were said to. have belonged
to a watch-tower in the days of the
preceptory ; and, nearer the house, some
broken ground, part of which had been
fish-ponds, now filled up With a growth of
alders and other moisture-loving trees,
whilst under a steep declivity appeared the

low arch of a deserted grotto, half covered
with pendent plants ; all this, set off br
the strong light and shadow of a sunny
day in June, formed a picture of no common
interest and beauty.

The pleasaunce too, with its rose-bushes
and other flowering shrubs, tuned into
actual trees, bending under the weight of
their blossoms, and the formal parterres —
thanks to Mabel's love of gardening, bright
with pinks and sweet-williams, larkheels,
(so Fletcher hath it,) marigolds and gillies
— the pleasaunce exhibited a strange
mixture of gaiety and desolation.

The sparkling fountain, whose waters,
shimmering in the sunshine, glittered like
showers of diamonds, no longer cooled and
refreshed the noontide air. That light was
extinguished ; those streams had ceased to
flow. Even the quaint basin, carved like
a huge cockle shell, such as a few centuries
before might have been seen amongst

the followers of the Knights of the Temple,
denoting the pilgrims from the Holy Land,
that shell-like basin, whose small reservoir
at once supplied and received the
slender jets of water which dropped into
the shallow pool with a <sound>sound</sound> so <sound>lulling</sound>
and so musical, was broken now and dry.
Even those tain hedges of holly and yew,
the living walls as smooth as masonry,
surmounted at regular distances by figures
bearing remote resemblances to phoenixes
or peacocks, dragons or bears, or other
birds and animals, existent or non-existent
those hedges, pride of the old gardener's
art, which sheltered at once the flower-plots
from the bleak north-east, and the
chaste dames of the hall from intrusion or
observation, had now, escaped from the
shears, broken into a wild luxuriance of
vegetation ; so that the spreading branches
and projecting tops had not merely obliterated
all traces of their former trim and

painful clippings, but had by their irregular
and disproportioned growth thrown
the crowning monsters into inextricable
confusion. The closely shaven turf was
overrun with moss ; the gravel paths were
covered vrith grass and weeds ; in short, at
Temple Laleham nature was every where
triumphing over art.

And amongst the fairest of nature's
works might be reckoned the blooming
rose-bud, Mabel Goodwin. She had finished
her task of twisting the straggling honeysuckle
round the old sun-dial, already
garlanded with the pink purple flowers of
the sweet-pea ; and after gazing earnestly
from side to side of that flowery prison,
the pleasaunce, enclosed as it was by
its high walls of yew and holly, and
peeping cautiously, in an attitude compounded
of looking and listening, through
an arch cut in the thick hedge, which
led into the chase ; after glancing somewhat

impatiently up at the old clock-tower,
which still held its stately place
amongst the gilded vanes and richly
carved pinnacles of the mansion, although
the machinery had ceased to perform its
office, and the deep solemn tongue which
seemed to convey a warning upon the
flight of time, as it told the hours, had
long been mute, — and casting another
fruitless and pettish look at the old sundial,
which had lost its gnomon, — and
then, holding her fair hand so as to shade
lier eyes from the glare, gazed to somewhat
more purpose upon the bright sun,
whose course in the heavens no neglect of
man could stay or change ; after three
several vain attempts to ascertain the
hour, she turned rapidly round as a slight
<sound>sound</sound> caught her quick ear, and was
aware of a young man, whose simple garb
could not conceal the air of high birth
and high breeding visible in every motion,

who had approached by one path as
she was watching for him by another,
and now stood at her side.

'^ So ! Master Arthur Montresor," exclaimed
the fair damsel, with the little
air of sauciness and coquetry which
formed so piquant a contrast with her
puritanic attire; ''So! this is the way
you over-sea gallants keep triste with a
simple country maiden ! Here have I been
for longer than I can tell ; and but that I
despatched old Jonathan to the hay-folk in
the lily-mead with a weighty bottle of
double ale, and mentioned something
about seeking marsh-mallows to make a
salve for Daniel's leg, which he cut half
off yester-eve, poor fellow, with his own
scythe, whilst he was at one and the same
time mowing a heavy swathe and listening
to a word in season from Ebenezer Crump,
but for the excuse of seeking these mallows,
and the sweet herbs for my father's

pottage, how I could have wandered here
none can tell ; and to find you absent !
One should have thought that the prospect
of a dinner would have made you punctual.
Take it, can't you ?" continued Mabel, as
she hastily flung the herbs she spoke of,
mallows, sweet-marjoram, marigolds, and
thyme, from a basket which lay on the
tui'f, half hidden by a great rose-bush, and
handed to her companion with rather more
care a large packet wrapped in a napkin,
which the loose bundle of mallows had
covered most effectually.

Take the packet and off with it to your
hiding place. Master Arthur'' resumed
she. " You have small cause for thanks,
I trow, since the pasty was made of your
own deer, that's certain ; and 'tis odds but
the flask of canary may, in bygone days,
have inhabited the spacious cellarage of
Temple Laleham. Leave kissing my hand,
good Arthur, and away ! Kay, nay ! rest

here a moment, fair cousin," resumed the
pretty damsel, whose experience of the
'^ over-sea gallant's" delight in her society
had been such as to occasion no small surprise
at the ready obedience to the command
of leaving her which he testified
upon the present occasion. " You mayas
well stay just for one moment, just to
tell me in the first place the cause why
you are so <sound>silent</sound> and so sad, and in the
next to have an opportunity of profiting by
the perusal of a billet which I have received
this very morning from my ^ unworthy
suitor,' as he calls himself; Minas
eldest son and heir of Aminadab
Holdfast, the elder, scrivener of Newport."

A billet from Aminadab, Mabel I and
you allow him" —

" Hear the story out, beau cousin ! A
billet in verse. Have patience and you
shall hear all. Many a long year back,
before the worst of these bad times, when

your dear mother, Lady Montresor, profited
of the very distant kindred that
subsisted between our houses to show all
manner of kindness in my father's absence
to his motherless girls, and to me, the
youngest, more especially, — for, somehow,
my sister Kesiah shrank away from her
notice as if anticipating the sad division
that was to come : — Well, you may remember
in those days when you, a tall
youth, and I a small damsel" —

" When I used to call you ' my little
wife,' Mabel, and my dear mother smiled
at the word. Oh, I remember those days
well — too well, perhaps, for a penniless
exile ! " and the beau cousin <sound>sighed</sound>.

^^ Fie, Arthur!" resumed the fair maiden.
'' Let me get on with my story.
Well, in those days there arrived from
foreign parts, — sent, by Sir Philip, from
Italy, was it not ? — a certain instrument
which, if laid in an open window, and

swept by the wind, would discourse a
music as strange as the means by which it
was produced ; so wild and sweet, and
sad, were the <sound>sounds</sound>."

" I remember as if it were yesterday
my poor mother's delight in those long
melancholy cadences, and the fears of the
domestics, who, even after the simple
machinery was shown, and explained to
them, continued to believe it something
ominous, if not supernatural. But what
can the soliman harp have to do with
Aminadaband his billet?"

"You shall hear. Some fortnight since,
after, in one of my half-stolen sits to the
Temple Laleham library and the dear
pleasaunce, I had discovered you, fair cousin,
and your hiding-place, old Judith, discoursing
of signs and omens, spoke of the
^ wind music ' up at the mansion, and Keg
curiosity was much excited ; so, to
prevent a visit, which might have endan-

VOL. ITT. B

gored your secret, I ran here the next
morning at daybreak, and having after a
long search discovered the lost treasure,
carried it home forthwith''

*^ Still, what has that to do with Ami-nawab
?"

Why, the sweet youth — hast ever seen
him, Arthur ? He's the very model of a
puritan scrivener's only son and heir'; plain,
precise, stiff, and slow, dropping out his
words at the rate of a syllable to a minute,
and stalking along the highway at a pace
which, at a liberal computation, may average
some half mile an hour. He is allover
an epitome of puritanism and law.
The new suit in which he comes a-courting
crackles like parchment, and he makes
love in a jargon filched from the mortgages
and title deeds which that cunning
thief his father has stolen from their right
owners. Hath he not your estate at Mon-tremor
Vale ? Yes I I know he hath.

Well, Arthur ! you are going to say over
again, what makes all this to the billet ?
sow the truth is, that this accomplished
swain happening to see me one fair morning
^Yith a volume of Spenser in my hand,
and knowing, from the look of the stanzas
that it was verse, and, scandalized at
the title, — for of all commerce with any
queens, more especially the Faerie Queene,
we may safely hold him guiltless, — began
vituperating the poets and poesy in such
a fashion that I, thinking to be rid of him,
forbade him my presence until he had, to
make amends for his crime of lese poesie,
produced a copy of verses in my honour."

'^ And he has written them ? And these
are they?" quoth Master Arthur Montresor,
taking them carelessly from Mabel's fair
hand. delightfully bad, of course''
added he.

I crave your pardon, they are on the
contrary so good that, although Aminadab

E 2

hath engrossed, and in some sort appropriated
by engrossing them, — for one can't
call those square angular characters hand
of writ — I should as soon suspect Holdfast
the elder, his honoured father, of the composition
as himself. I dare say he has
stolen them, as that respectable scrivener
would steal an estate. It's the family
trick. Head them, Arthur !"

'' Addressed to Celia, and signed Mentor.
What will the precisian, his father,
say to names so heathenish ?"

TO AN soliman Harp.

ADDRESSED TO THE LADY OF ALL BEAUTY, THE
THRICE FAIR CELIA.

Oh ! breezy harp ! that, with thy fond complaining.
Hast held my willing ear this whole night long ;
Mourning as one might deem, yon moon, slow waning,
Sole listener oft of thy melodious song ;

Sweet harp ! if hushed awhile that tuneful sorrow,
Which may not flow intermitted still,
A lover's prayer one strain less sad might borrow,
Of all thou poorest at thine own sweet will.

"Now, when — her forehead inthat pale moon gleaming,
Yon dark-tressed maid beneath the softening hour,
As fain to lose no touch of thy sad streaming,

Leans to the night from forth her latticed bower ;

And the low whispering air, and thy lone ditty,

Around her heart their mingled spells have wove ;
Now cease those notes awhile that plain for pity,
And wake thy bolder song, and ask for love.

A3IYNT0R."

" Stolen of a surety ! none of Minas
handiwork." And, with a gravity
which Mabel was far from expecting, he
returned the manuscript.

'' But wherefore thus amort, fair cousin?
Methinks a love-ditty from yon starched
puritan were no ill cause of mirth''

Not quite stolen, although none of my handiwork.
Again sir. Kenyon's kind gift.

*she may laugh, the rather that, by
issuing your commands and accepting his
obedience, you are doing your best to
further his suit. Think of this, dear
Mabel, and put curb and rein on your
gay spirit, so that it lead you into no
straits when your poor cousin Arthur Mon-tremor
is close mewed up, and can no longer
pester you with grave counsel, or listen to
the prattle which he has loved too well.
They have tracked me, Mabel, all day
long. I have felt that the spy, Ebenezer,
the creature of old Holdfast, is upon my
footsteps, although by escaping through
the wilderness to the pleasaunce, walled
in by those tall yews and hollies, I have
for the moment baffled him. And, what
is worse, an important missive (for my
errand here was not merely to see once
again my old ancestral mansion — the
home of my forefathers, and to fall in love
with the sweet plaything of my early

years, my own little wife), what is far
worse, they have, I fear, a missive compromising
far higher names than mine —
even Ormond himself. Hark I That is
Fidele's bark ! The spies are at hand."

" Away with thee, dear Arthur I
They know not the secret of the library
window, which thou canst reach in a
moment ; nor of the under-ground passage
between the house and the grotto, leading
from that very room. Fly thither, and
leave me to baffle them I Away, dear
Arthur ! Be quiet, Fidele."

An hour after this dialogue, Mabel
Goodwin's round and <sound>ringing</sound> voice was
heard in the grotto, <sound>singing</sound> to a popular
air the first line of Aminadab's love-ditty :

Oh, breezy harp, that with thy fond complaining."

** Ought not Aminadab to be greatly flattered,
Fidele, that I, all alone here, except

thy faithful self, my pretty Fidele, am
singing his verses —

Oh breezy harp !'

I wonder whether anybody hears me !"

And, gathering fi-om her words that she
was indeed alone, the young cavalier
emerged from the subterranean passage
into a dark cave beyond the grotto, from
whence he could, if necessary, effect an
immediate retreat ; the grotto itself being
filled with garden-pots, rakes, hoes, and
other light tools, which at once formed an
excuse for Mabel's visit, and ensured her
of warning in case any other person should
approach.

'' They are gone, Arthur !" cried Mabel
triumphantly. '' They are both gone,
Ebenezer Crump, and old master Holdfast,
in his proper person, half a dozen miles
on the way to London by this time ; and
what do you think they have taken with

them to lay before the Protector ? Guess !
Guess ! Aminaflab's love-ditty ! What
think you of that ?

Oh breezy harp, that with thy fond complaining !'

"It's a pity they ^Yon't know the tune !
There's your letter — the letter — mind that
you don t drop it again, my good friend ;
for one can't expect every day to get a
copy of verses from that mirror of puritans
to send in the stead. How did I manage,
do you want to know ? Why, Ebenezer
had the letter in his hand, girdled round
with a bit of red silk, and secured by a
seal ; and while Master Holdfast was examining
the herbs in my basket (luckily
you had taken the wine and pasty with
you), I begged to look at the packet, pretending
to admire the gloss silk and the
seal by which it was fastened, and so
slipped the letter out, and the verses in.
To think how his Highness the Protector

will stare to see an address to the Lady of
all Beauty, signed Mentor ! and Master
Holdfast, when he shall recognise the hand
of writ of Aminadab !

Oh breezy harp !'

It is really worth the fright to think how
delightfully they'll be puzzled. But then
to look, Arthur, on your grave face ! I do
verily believe you would that this missive
of yours, with all its treason against
the Lord Protector, had gone to whitehall
rather than that song''

'^ Not so, dearest Mabel ! Your quick
wit and ready hand have saved my life,
and the lives of others far more valuable
than mine ; but at a risk to yourself when
the change of letters is known, as known
it must be right speedily, at a risk to your
own happiness which I tremble to think
of. As for me, I must avail myself of the
respite afforded me to prepare the means

of escape. Thou, fairest and dearest" —
He checked himself, and continued in a
lower tone — " Were it too much to ask of
thee to meet me here three nights hence ?
By that time" — he again paused — ^4hou
wilt not fear to trust thyself here at midnight
? Thou wilt not mistrust thy poor
cousin ? Thou wilt come hither, sweetest
Mabel?"

I must go now, at any rate'' said the
little damsel, blushing. '^ My father is ill
at ease, and may lack my presence ; and,
strict though he be, and demure as is my
good sister Kesiah, I do firmly believe
that he, albeit he calls me <sound>rattle</sound>-brain and
madcap, and chides my vagaries a dozen
times a day, doth in reality, and in the
bottom of his heart, love me a hundredfold
better than he does her. A fair afternoon
to you. Master Arthur Montresor.
What would you give now to see the

Lord Protector's face when lie opens
Aminadab's love-ditty ! —

Oh breezy harp !' "

And off the gipsy tripped.
*****

The third night arrived, a true English
summer night, the west wind <sound>sighing</sound>, the
moon nearly at full, labouring through
drifting clouds, at one moment illumining
the <sound>silent</sound> mansion and the noble park, at
another enveloping all around in the
deepest shadow. The youth and maiden
stood within the ruined grotto ; Mabel
wrapping herself in her hood and scarf,
but shivering nevertheless, partly from the
effect of the night dew, partly from strong
emotion, for the cousins (why not use the
true word, and call them lovers ?) seemed
to have changed characters ; so earnest
and ardent were his pleadings, and her
replies so grave and sad.

And yet, perhaps, the transition from
extraordinary gaiety to silent depression
is more common than it seems. Both extremes
of manner and of feeling belong to
the same sensitive temperament, the same
chameleon-like power of reflecting with
equal intensity the brightest sunshine and
the darkest shade — much as poor Mabel's
pet, Lady Montresor's old peacock, which
reflected the noontide light so brilliantly,
seeming to throw off showers of gold and
coloured gems as it waved its glittering
plumage, sat now perched upon the low
bough of one of the great linden trees,
dusky, dark, and shadowy as Night herself.
Of such slight wear is gaiety in this
changeful world ! Cheerfulness stands the
test better. That may be likened to Mabel's
other feathered friend, the brooding
swan, who sits half hidden by sedges upon
her nest in yonder islet, carrying the
serene beauty of her snowy plumage into

the gloomiest recesses, '^ making a sunshine
in the shady place'' rejoicing in her
pure and silvery whiteness '* from moonless
midnight to matin prime'

But we must return to our lovers.

All has befallen as I predicted, Mabel.
Without exactly knowing that for which
it was a substitute, the trick of the love-ditty
has been detected, and my presence
here so far ascertained as to ensure tomorrow's
bringing spies and soldiers,
horse and foot, upon the track, to ransack
this old place ; aided by the local knowledge
of the scrivener. Holdfast, eager to
rid himself of me, that he may retain unquestioned
possession of Montresor Yale,
the Northern property of our old house ;
thrice eager to obtain thy hand for the
formal precisian, his son, that he may
join these goodly manors to the estates
that he already calls his. And thou — "

Ay, my sentence is already passed. I

must wed Aminadab, or relinquish all
hope of pardon from my father." And
poor mabel's tears poured down like
rain.

*^ Wed Aminadab, and embrace misery
for thy whole life long ! Ko, sweetest
Mabel, that must never be. Dearest,
when sent to England by Charles himself,
joined in his honouring confidence with
that soul of honour, Ormond, and brought
by the duties of my mission near to our
old home, I fancied that it was only the
love of the pleasant scene where I had
passed my happy youth that brought me
to Temple Laleham and chained me there.
Desperate was that self-deception, Mabel.
I came here that I might see once again
the lovely child, the remembrance of whose
graces had steeled my heart against the
fair dames of France and Italy. I remained
here because I found that lovely
child ripened into lovelier woman, and for

the first and only time I felt that I loved.
The poor exile dared not woo the rich
heiress, and I was <sound>silent</sound>. But now — oh,
Mabel, I cannot leave thee to the destiny
with which thou art threatened. Come
with me, fairest, dearest ! The prospects
of the Cavaliers are brightening. A
mightier conqueror. Death himself, is
wrestling With the great warrior who
hath sat so firmly, I had well nigh said so
worthily, on the English throne. His son
cannot fill that seat. And then — but
even if that hope fail, and we be still
poor, my Mabel — "

" I think not of riches. They are as
dust in the balance. My father, Arthur !
my poor, poor father !''

^^ Will he be happier, think'st thou, to
see thee wretched with one whom thou
canst not love, and to feel and know that
he caused that wretchedness ? Come,
sweetest, the horses wait."

'^ He kissed me to-night, and blessed
me; — laid his hand upon my head and
blessed me, Arthur. ]\Iy dear, dear
father ! I cannot leave him, Arthur I And
she wrung her hands, and <sound>sobbed</sound> as if
her heart would break.

'' Wilt thou stay to wed Aminadab ?
"We shall return, Mabel, to thy father;
return to kneel together for his blessing.
And he has still Kesiah. Here is thy
palfrey. Place that little foot in my
hand. So."

'' My father ! my poor father !"

And, <sound>weeping</sound> and <sound>exclaiming</sound>, she rode
away.

« # « # #

A twelvemonth had gone by. The
summer sun shone once more on the fair
mansion and the rich woods of Temple
Laleham. The great Protector was dead,
and Eichard Cromwell had seemed as well
pleased to relinquish the task of sove-

VOL III. F

reign as Charles had been to ascend his
ancestral throne. The kingdom after its
long unrest was beginning to settle into
tranquillity, when, one fine morning, the
offending daughter (now, by the death of
stout Sir Philip, Lady Montresor) stood
humbly before her father's door. Kesiah
received her there with the kiss of sisterly
affection.

"My father! my dear father'' said
poor Mabel.

He is better, much," replied Kesiah,
answering the look rather than the word ;
" greatly better in health, and prepared
to see you."

The sisters sought his room in <sound>silence</sound> ;
and Mabel fell <sound>weeping</sound> at his feet, and
laid her head upon his knee.

"Father! dear father!"

And again she <sound>wept</sound>.

Softened by illness, by the sight of his
favourite child, and above all by her fondness

and humility, the old man once again
laid his trembling hand upon her head.

Smiling through her tears, she received
the benediction in joyful <sound>silence</sound>.

'' Thou hast a son, Mabel. What hast
thou called the varlet ?^

^^ John Goodwin, dear father !'^

John Goodwin ! poor silly wench !
and I would not suffer Kesiah to name
him in my presence ! John Goodwin !
poor wench ! poor wench ! They tell me,
Mabel, that thy husband is as silly as
thyself ; that he hath been striving in the
council against his own rights, and contenting
himself with winning back his
estate of Montresor Yale from his old
enemy. Holdfast hath caused the mansion
and lands of Temple Laleham to
abide with me. Well ! well ! thou must
dwell there, Mabel, and so must he, and
the young knave, thy son."

"Nay, father, is there not room for

you and Kesiah also? room for us all?
Let us not be parted again, dear father !
never let us be parted again !"

And at Temple Laleham the reconciled
family, father and children, Roundhead
and Cavalier, dwelt to a good old age, in
peace and honour.

**I have no joy of this contract to-night."

Shakspeare.

^^What!" not a word to thy poor old
nurse, or thy faithful bower-women ? Not
a nod, or a smile, or a kindly look, to
show that thou eldest us? Thou that
wast wont to be the merriest and kindliest
damsel in merry Cumberland, the fair and
bold Edith Clifford, the wealthiest maiden
north of Trent; about to be wedded, too,
to the young Lord Howard, the goodliest
and the bravest knight of Xing Hey's

court, for whose favour the gay dames of
the south have been trying and viewing
at pageant, at joust, and at tournament,
ever since his return from the wars ! Men
say that, for all that he hath fought
against the Soldan, and carried the
blanche-lions'* the old banner of his
house, foremost among the proud chivalry
of France and Italy, he hath rather the
mien of a young page than of a stalwart
warrior, so smooth and fair is his brow,
so graceful his form, so gentle and courteous
his bearing. Still amort. Sweeting !
mute as a marble image on thy very
bridal eve P And the good old Margaret,
seeing her lady still unmoved, paused for
very vexation.

So generous a wooer, too !" exclaimed
one of the attendant maidens, glancing at
the profusion of rich gifts with which a
heavy wain had been laden, and which
had arrived that very day at the castle,

under convoy of the good knight's squire,
and a score or two of pages and men-at-arms,
and which now lay in magnificent
profusion about the tapestried chamber,
scattered amidst the quaint antique furniture,
high-backed ebony chairs, oaken
screens, cut into mimic lace-work ; marble
slabs, resting on gilded griffins, or some
such picturesque monsters of heraldry;
and huge cabinets, composed of the rarest
woods, an entire history, profane or sacred,
carved upon the doors, and surmounted
with spires and pinnacles, like the decorated
shrine of a Gothic cathedra-al; the
whole scene, lighted up by the bright
beams of the evening sun, coloured into a
thousand vivid hues, as they glanced
through the storied panes of the oriel
window. A scene more bright, or more
gorgeous, than that stately lady's bower,
tenanted, as it was, by woman in her
fairest forms, by venerable age and

blooming youth, could hardly be found in
merry England. Yet there sat the youthful
lady of the castle, in the midst of all
this costly beauty, languid and listless,
pale and motionless as a statue.

"So generous a wooer, too !" exclaimed
Mistress Bridget, the pretty bright eyed
brunette, the Lady Edith's principal bower-woman,
who, being reckoned the best
adjuster of a head-tire, and the most
skilful professor of all arts of the loom and
the needle, whether in white-seam, cutwork,
tapestry, or broidery, of any maiden
in the north country, was, more especially,
alive to the rarity and richness of Lord
Howard's gifts.

" So generous a wooer, too ! only look
at these carpets from Persia ! 'Tis a marvel
how folk can have the heart to put foot
on such bright flowers ; they seem as if
they were growing ! And these velvets
from Genoa ; were ever such colours seen ?

And the silken stuffs from Padua, that
stand on end with their own richness ;
what kirtles and mantles they ^dll make !
And the gloves of Cales, that cause the
chamber to smell like a garden full of
spice, cloves, and jessamine ! And these
veils from the Low Countries, as fine as a
spider's web ! And the cloth of gold, and
the cloth of silver, — where did Master
Eustace say they came from, Dame Margaret?
And this golden vessel for perfumes,
which looks like a basket all
over-run with grapes and ivy ? "

'^ That was wrought by a cunning goldsmith
of Florence'' responded old Margaret,
^^ whose skill is so surpassing, that,
albeit he employs chiefly the precious
metals, the workmanship is of more value
than the materials. This silver tray, with
the delicate trellis-work, wreathed with
lilies and roses round the edge, and the
story of Diana and Ac — Ac — fie on my
old brains ! I shall forget my own name

soon ! — Diana and — he that was turned
into a stag — "

Actaeon !" whispered Alice, the fairest
and most youthful of the Lady Edith's attendants,
gently and unostentatiously supplying
the good dame's failure of memory,
without looking up from her work.

"Ay, Actaeon! I thank thee, Alice.
Thy wits are younger than mine by fifty
good years, or more. This silver salver,
with the light delicate edge, that seems
like the work of the fairies, and the story
of Diana and Actaeon inside, is by the same
hand."

And then the caskets of precious
stones !" pursued the enthusiastic waiting
damsel, warming at the contemplation of
the finery. '' The brooches and bracelets !
The coronets and the castanets ! Why,
yonder wreath of emeralds and amethysts,
which lies on the table underneath the
great Venetian glass — to think of my lady

never having had the curiosity to look into
that /" (and Mistress Bridget took a self-satisfied
peep at her own pretty figure, as
it was reflected on the broad clear surface
of the rare and costly mirror), " that single
wreath, which she hath never vouchsafed
to glance upon : and the ropes of pearls
which I laid upon her lap, and which she
hath let drop upon the floor ; do pick them
up, Alice ! — I verily believe the foolish
wench caret as little for these precious
adornments as the Lady Edith herself!
That one wreath, and those strings of pearls
be worth an earl's ransom."

At this moment the <sound>sound</sound> of a harp was
heard, and the <sound>voice</sound> of the minstrel arose
from beneath the casement : —

Waken to pleasure

Lady sweet I
Lo ! an empire's treasure

Is spread at thy feet :
Here be shawls of Cashmere fine ;
Rubies from Bulgaria's mine ;

The pear-shaped pearls of Ormuz' bay ;
And gold, 'mid Yemen's sands that lay.
Waken to pleasure,

Lady sweet !
Love, and Love's treasure,

Be spread at thy feet."

The air was smooth and flowing, and the
voice that of Eobert Fits-Stephen, one of
the most approved of the courtly minstrels:
but still the Lady Edith sat pale and
motionless, as though the tide of <sound>melody</sound>
had glided unfelt over her senses, producing
no more impression than the
waters of the lake upon the plumage of
the cygnet.

Dame Margaret <sound>sighed</sound> deeply, and
Bridget giving her head a provoked impatient
jerk, resumed her embroidery with
such furious rapidity, that she broke her
silk half-a-dozen times in the course of a
minute, and well nigh spoiled the carnation
upon which she was engaged, and
which she had intended to outvie the natural

blossom in Father Francis's flower-border.
Young Alice, drawing her 
nearer to them, and further
from Lady Edith, and speaking in a low
tone, even lower than her own soft and
gentle natural voice, resumed the conversation.


For my own part, good Bridget (call
me foolish an' thou wilt), I do not wonder
at our sweet lady's sadness. Think what
a piteous thing it is to be an orphan ; think
but of that great grief ! And then to be a
great heiress to boot, left in the king's ward
and dragged from her own dear home in her
old dear north countries, to this fine grand
castle (which, albeit her own also in right
of her lady mother, seems too strange and
too grand for happiness), and all for the
purpose of being wedded to this young
lord, with his costly glittering gifts, who
had never vouchsafed to come near her

until now, on the very eve of the bridal,
when it hath pleased him to give notice of
his approach. Holy St. Agatha defend me
from such a wooer ! A wooer, whose actions
shew, as plainly as words could tell,
that he seeketh Lady Edith's broad lands,
and caret as little for the Lady Edith's
warm heart as I do for a withered rose-leaf.
I'll tell thee what, Bridget, I never
look to see such happy days again, as
when we dwelt in our old dear home,
amongst the pleasant vales and breezy
mountains of Cumberland. There was
health and freedom in the very air. Dost
thou not remember the day when old
Geoffrey the falconer had lamed himself
among the rocks, and the youth Albert,
the travelling minstrel, took charge of the
hawks, and waited on my lady, as if he
had been trained to the sport all his lifelong
! Hast thou forgot how she stood by

the lake, ^tli her favourite merlin on her
wrist, and her white greyhound Lilly-bell
at her side, looking like the very goddess
of the chase, so full of life, and spirit, and
cheeriness? And that bright evening,
when she led the dance at the Maypole ?
"Well a-day, poor lady ! 'tis a woful
change! "

It was remarkable that the Lady Edith's
attention, which neither the louder speech
of her elder attendants, nor the ringing
tones of the harper, had been able to command,
was arrested at once by the soft low
voice of Alice. The womanly sympathy
sank soothingly into the woman's heart,
just as the gentle rain from heaven penetrates
the parched hill-side, from whose
arid surface the sharp and arrowy hail rebounds
-svdthout impression. The drooping
mistress listened in mournful <sound>silence</sound>,
whilst her faithful maiden, unconscious
that she had attracted her notice, piu-sued.

in still lover accents, the train of thought
which her own fond recollections of the
freedom and happiness which they had
tasted among their native mountains had
awakened in her mind.

^^ Poor Albert, too ! the wandering minstrel,
who came to the castle gate to crave
lodging for one night, and sojourned with
us for three long months ; and then, when
he had wrought himself up to go, — and,
verily, it was a parting like that of the
spirit and the flesh, when he left oiu:
old walls, — returned again and again, and
finally fixed himself in the fisherman's
cottage, where the mountain streamlet,
after meandering along the meadow, falls
into the lake. Poor Albert ! I warrant
me he taketh good care of Lily-bell and
my lady's merlin, whereof he craved the
charge from old Geoffrey. I marvel whether
my lady knoweth that her pretty
Lily-bell and her favourite falcon be in

hands that will tend them so heedfully, for
her dear sake ! To my fancy, Bridget,
that poor youth, albeit so fearful and so
ashamed in her presence, worshipped the
very ground that she trod upon. I have
seen him kiss Lily-bell's glossy head,
after her hand had patted it, reverently
and devotedly, as though it had been a
holy relique in the great minster at
Durham."

Again the full and <sound>ringing</sound> <sound>chords</sound> of the
harp — but, this time, to an old border air,
well kno^Yn to the Northern maidens —
rose from beneath the casement. The
voice, too, was different from that of the
courtly minstrel — deeper, manlier, pouring
forth the spirit of the words, as they
gushed spontaneously, as it seemed, from
his lips, as though, in his case, song were
but the medium of feeling, and the poet's
fancy and the musician's skill were merged

VOL. III. Grin

the passionate grief of the despairing
lover. So the strain <sound>rang</sound>: —

High o'er the baron's castle tall,
Rich banners float with heavy fall ;
And light and <sound>song</sound>, in mingling tide,
Pour forth, to hail the lovely bride.
Yet, lady, still the birchen tree
Waves o'er the cottage on the lea ;
The babbling stream runs bright and fair, —
The love star of the West shines there."

**Ha!" exclaimed old Margaret;" that
ditty hath aroused my lady. See how she
listens."

'Tis the roundelay which she herself
was wont to sing' observed Bridget ;
but the words are different."

Peace! peace !" cried the Lady Edith,
checking, with some impatience, the prattle
of her attendants, and leaning against
the casement which she had flung open, as
the deep and earnest <sound>voice</sound> of the minstrel

again resounded through the apartment.
" Be silent, I pray ye !''

Mailed wardens pace o'er keep and tower ;
Gay maidens deck the lady's bower ;
Page, squire, and knight, a princely train,
Wait duteous to her bridle rein.
Yet in that cot the milk-white hound,
The favourite falcon, still are found ;
And one more fond, more true than they,
Bon to adore and to obey."

Alack ! alack !" <sound>sighed</sound> the tenderhearted
Alice. ^^ Well-a-day, poor youth !
I ever deemed that his strange fondness
for Lily-bell — albeit as pretty and playful
a creature as ever gambolled on the greensward,
and as swift of foot as ever followed
hare over the mountains — had a deeper
source than love of the good hound. Well-a-day,
poor Albert ! He was a goodly
youth !

'' Hush ! hush !" exclaimed the Lady
Edith, as the symphony finished, and the

<sound>voice</sound>, again mingled Ayith the <sound>chords</sound> of the
harp, <sound>struck</sound> falteringly and unsteadily
now, as though the hand trembled, and the
heart waxed faint.

The coronet of jewels rare
Sh inesproudly o'er her face so fair ;
And titles high and higher name
Lord Howard's lovely bride may claim.
And yet the wreath of hawthorn bough
Once lighter pressed that snowy brow ;
And hearts that-wither now were gay,
When she was but the Queen of May."

Alas ! alas ! my lady, my dear sweet
lady !" murmured Alice to herself, as poor
Edith, after lingering at the window long
enough to ascertain that the harp was
<sound>silent</sound>, and the harper gone, sank into a
seat with a <sound>sigh</sound> and a look of desolation
that proved more plainly than words, the
truth of the last lines of the minstrel's
lay.

*' Alas ! alas ! dear lady !" exclaimed she
in a <sound>louder</sound> tone, as the sudden <sound>burst</sound> of

startling <sound>noises</sound>, the warlike <sound>blasts</sound> of trump
and cornet, the jarring dissonant <sound>sound</sound>
caused by raising the heavy portcullis, and
lowering the massive drawbridge, and the
<sound>echoing</sound> tramp of barbed steeds and mailed
horsemen in the courts of the castle,
showed that the expected bridegroom had
at length arrived.

Edith wrung her hands in desperation.

"This knight I cannot, and I will not
see. Go to him, Margaret ; say that I am
sick — that I am dying. The blessed saints
can bear witness that thou wilt say but
the truth in so telling him. Sick at heart
am I, sick to the death ! Oh ! that I had
died before this wretched hour !'' And poor
Edith burst into an agony of tears, that
shook her very frame.

Why goes thou not, Margaret ?" inquired
she, a few moments after, when,
exhausted its own violence, her grief had
become more tranquil. '' Why dost thou

not carry my message to the Lord Howard?
Why dally thus, old dame ? Bridget, go
thou ! They stand about me as though I
were an ignorant child, that knew not
what she said! Do my bidding on the
instant, Bridget : thou wert best !"

Nay, good my lady, but our gracious
lord the king — "

Tell me not of kings, maiden ! I'll to
sanctuary. I'll fly this very night to my
aunt, the prioress of St. Mary's. The
church knoweth well how to protect her
votaries. Woe is me ! that, for being
born a rich heir, I must be shut from the
free breath of heaven, the living waters,
and the flowery vales, in the dark and
gloomy cloister ! To change the locks
that float upon the breeze for the dismal
veil ! To waste my youth in the cold
and narrow convent cell — a living tomb I
Oh ! it is a sad and a weary lot. But
better so, than to plight my troth to one

whom I have never seen, and can never
love ! to give my hand to one man,
whilst my heart abideth with another."

"Lady!" cried Margaret; "do my
senses play me false ? Or is it Edith
Clifford that speaketh tins of a low-bon
churl?"

A low-bon churl I" responded Edith.
There is a regality of mind and of spirit
about that youth, which needed neither
wealth nor lineage to even him with the
greatest — the inborn nobility of virtue
and of genius ! Xever till now knew I

that he loved me ; and now . Hasten

to this lord, Alice; and see that he
Cometh not hither. Wherefore interest
thou, maiden?" inquired Edith, of the
pitying damsel who staid her steps with
an <sound>exclamation</sound> of surprise, as the door
of the chamber was gently opened. " Tell
the Lord Howard the very truth; men
say that he is good and wise — too wise,

too good, to seek his own happiness at the
expense of a poor maiden's misery. Tell
him the whole truth, Alice. Spare thy
mistress that shame. Say that I love him
not ; say that I love ''

I^ay, sweetest lady, from thine own
dear lips must come that sweet confession,"
said a voice at her side, and, turning
to the well-known accents, Edith saw, at
her feet, him, who having won her heart
as the wandering minstrel, the humble falconer,
claimed her hand as the rich and
high-born Philip Howard, the favourite of
the king.

A <sound>cry</sound> of joy <sound>burst</sound> from the astonished
waiting-women, and was <sound>echoed</sound> by the
pretty greyhound Lily-bell, who had followed
the Lord Howard into the room, and
now stood trembling with ecstacy before
her fair mistress, resting her head in her
lap, and looking up into her face with eyes
beaming with affectionate gladness — eyes
that literally glowed with delight.

Never was happiness more perfect than
that of the betrothed maiden, on this so
dreaded bridal eve. And heartily did her
faithful attendants sympathize in her happiness
; only Bridget found it impossible
to comprehend why, in the hoi' of hope
and joy, as in that of fear and sorrow, her
dearly beloved finery should be neglected.

To think," quoth the provoked bower-woman,
^^ that now that all these marvels
have come about, and that the Lord
Howard turns out to be none other than
the youth Albert, my lady will not vouchsafe
to tell me whether her kirtle shall be
of cloth of gold or cloth of silver ; or whether
she will don the coronet of rubies or
the emerald wreath ! Well-a-day I " quoth
Bridget, '' this love I this love !"

'* They have all been touched, and found base metal. "

Shakspeare.

'^ So ! This is my return to my native
village ! This my reception from relatives
who owe me so much ! " Thus thought,
rather than said, a poor-looking old man,
as he stood leaning over the gate of a
newly-cleared wheat-field, in the bright,
bustling, busy harvest time. '' One,"
exclaimed he, as his musings took a tone
of passion which broke unconsciously into
words : "One — yonder portly landlady,

forsooth, sitting in her bar, as she is
pleased to call it — her bar, quotha I In
my young days it was the little boarded
parlour opening from the tap-room. A bar
in the old Eed Lion ! What shall we hear
of next? One, bedecked and bedizened,
with her gown like a rainbow, her fringed
apron, and her cap stuck out with flowers,
sitting in her bar, if that be its style and
title, amongst her glasses and punch-bowls,
with a bell upon her table, and a net of
lemons dangling above her head; she. Miss
Collins, as she calls herself — she used to
answer to the name of Jenny Collins
twenty years agone — refused point-blank
to acknowledge me I denied to my face
that she had ever seen me ! called me a
cheat and an impostor ! wondered at my
impudence in attempting to pass myself
for her dear uncle Michael Xorris ! threatened
me with the stocks and the roundhouse,
the justice and the jail ! Precious

minx ! She whom I rescued from drudgery
and starvation, from living half shop-woman,
half maid, with the stingy, termagant,
clear starcher, in Belford Marsh!
whom I set up in that very Eed Lion ! —
perched upon her throne, the arm-chair, in
the bar ! — purchased the lease, the furniture,
the goodwill ! paid her first year's
rent ! stocked her cellars ! <sound>clapped</sound> a
hundred-pound bank-note into her hand !
And now that I come home, old and lame,
sick and ragged, she reviles me as a
vagabond and an impostor, and tells me to
be thankful to her compassion and tenderheartedness
that she does not send for the
constable to carry me to jail ! Liar that
she is ! base, ungrateful, perjured liar ! for
she knew me. I saw that she knew me ;
ay, as well as I knew her. She would be
glad to be no more altered in the years
that have changed her from a slim girl of
twenty-five to a bloated woman of five-and-forty,

than I, in those same years, nth all
my griefs!

'' Then her brother — faugh ! It maddens
one to think of their baseness ! — her
brother, whom I educated and apprenticed,
finding him money afterwards to put him
into partnership with old Jones the thriving
linen-draper. He, indeed, did not pretend
to deny that I might be his uncle : — but,
grant that I were, what claim had I upon
his charity more than any other starving
wretch ? What was I to him ? He pitied
me, Heaven knew I but what could I expect
from him ? Oh, the smooth-speaking,
soft-spoken knave ! with his pity and his
charity ! Hypocrite in look and word !
His tone was as gentle as if he had been
bidding me welcome to bed and board for
my whole life long. What a fawning
parasite that would have been now, if I
had accosted him like a rich man ! Well,
there is soma virtue in these rags, since

they teach false tongues to speak truth.
Then came my cousin Anthony, whose
daughter I portioned, whose runaway son
I clothed and sent to sea. And this
Anthony is now a great malian — a rich
miser who could buy up half the county.
What said he ? "Why he was poor himself —
the scoundrel ! — nobody knew how poor,
and had been forced to make a rule to give
nothing to beggars; ay, he called me a
beggar ! I might go to the Union, he said;
that was the fittest place for me. To the
Union ! the workhouse ! Oh, the precious
rascal ! The son of my father's brother,
brought up in my father's house — worth
a hundred thousand pounds, and would
have sent me to the workhouse — me,
his only living kinsman ! Oh, this world !
this world ! Then — for I was resolved
to try them all — I sought out my old
schoolfellow Nicholas Hume, the spendthrift,
whom I bailed in my young days,

when little richer than himself, and saved
from prison by paying his debts. What
was his gratitude? Why he, forsooth
had never heard my name. Michael
Xorris ! Who was Michael Morris ? Oh,
they knew me well enough twenty years
ago, when I returned from the West Indies
a rich man, husband of a wealthy Creole,
master of flourishing plantations, to visit
my early haunts, help my poor relations —
I found them all in distress some way or
other — and shake hands with my old
friends. Nobody had forgotten me then.
But now that I come back a ragged
cripple, houseless and friendless" — And the
old man paused, and lifted his Wretched
hat from his thin grey hairs, and passed
his tattered handkerchief over his furrowed
brow, with an air which proved that he
was as much oppressed by mental suffering,
by indignation, and disappointment, as by
the sultry heat of an August noon.

'^ There are none left now," thought old
Michael to himself, as, exhausted by his
vehemence, he sank into a milder mood —
*^ none left for me to apply to now, except
the three orphan children of my poor
nephew William Leslie, the cousin of these
hard-hearted Collins, and their mother ;
and they, I fear, are themselves in great
want and great trouble. He, lately dead,
after a series of undeserved misfortunes
and a long and wasting illness ; and she,
working as hard as ever woman did work
to keep herself and her family out of the
workhouse — that Union to whose comforts
my precious cousin Anthony so tenderly
consigns me. Poor things! They may
well deny any knowledge of me ! for they
never saw me ; and I have had a good
sample of the slight impression that benefits
conferred leave behind them ! William
was only eighteen when I left England
and returned to Jamaica after my last

visit. A fine, frank-hearted lad lie was !
I remember wishing to take him with me.
But my poor sister would not part with
him. She had married again after the
death of her first husband, "William's
father, and a wretched match she made ;
for this second husband proved to be an
habitual drunkard, always half mad when
intoxicated, who broke out at last into
desperate frenzy, and, but for my interposition,
would have murdered the poor boy.
I seem to see the struggle now'' thought
the old man, closing his eyes ; ^^ he fringing
himself upon William with a table-knife,
and I rushing between them just soon
enough to receive the blade in my arm.
I bear the mark of the wound still. The
madman was sent to an asylum, and there
soon died. And my poor sister, well off
for her station, could not part from this
only son. He was a fine lad was William,
spirited and generous ; and when she also

VOL. III. H

(lied, he was already attached to the girl
whom he afterwards married. I helped
them, too, for I loved the boy ; I helped
on that match, for it was one of sincere
affection, and they were in a way to earn
a handsome competence : there must have
been some imprudence, or great ill luck,
to have reduced them to such poverty''
So ran the train of the old cripple's reverie.
I never suspected it ; he never wrote tome
; and I, engaged in my own affairs,

and with children then of my own

Well, I will see them, however. They
are in this field gleaning. So said their
neighbour. Yes ! This is the field ! There
they are. I'll see them," thought Michael
Norris, ^^ though it is probable that they
too will know nothing of me." And,
opening the gate, the old man limped
slowly across the furrows, and began
gathering the scattered ears of corn in his
withered hand.

We have said the field ^ although, after
passing the gate which admitted him
between the two high hedges that bounded
it on the northern side, the wide expanse
from which the wheat had just been carried
assumed the appearance rather of a large
open ridge of arable land, bordered by the
high road, and terminated by a distant
village, than of the small wooded enclosures
so common in the midland counties.
A pretty scene it was, as it lay before him,
bathed in the sunshine ; and a lovely
group was that to which his attention was
immediately directed. A pale young
woman, whose regular and beautiful features
received additional interest from her
close widow's cap, stood before him, holding
a fine infant in her arms ; a very pretty
girl of twelve or thirteen was flourishing
a tuft of wheat-ears before the baby's eyes,
smiling herself at the smile she excited,
while her little brother clung to the

H 2

mother's petticoat in momentary fear of
two high-fed dogs attending a gentleman
and lady riding slowly along the road.

The poor cripple drew back and sat
down under a clump of maple and hawthorn,
gay with the purple wild vetch, the
white bind weed, and the pretty clematis,
known by the still prettier name of '^ the
traveller's joy ;" whilst the riding-party
called off their dogs, spoke graciously to
the child and his mother, and passed slowly
out of sight. As they left her, Mrs.
Leslie, for she it was, approached the old
man, to replace her infant in his cradle,
niche under the fragrant shade of some
overhanging hazel-stems just beside his
rude seat. Struck by the evidence of
poverty, sickness, and sorrow afforded by
his tattered apparel and his wrinkled yet
venerable countenance, she took up a
pitcher which stood by the cradle, and,
with the kindness which the very poor so

often show to each, other, and a remark
upon the heat of the day, offered him a
small cupful of the milk which formed the
contents of the jug. He took it with a
trembling hand, and thanked her with an
emotion which our readers will comprehend,
but which at once surprised and interested
its object.

Your name is Leslie ?'' asked he, as,
after returning the cup with thanks and
blessings, he made room for her beside him
on the thymy bank.

*' Your name is Leslie ?''
" Margaret Leslie. It is so''
'' The wife of William Leslie ?"
'' His widow. Ah, me ! his widow I''
replied she, with a <sound>sigh</sound>. '^ The widowed
mother of those children. Michael''
added she, as the boy came near them,
take some milk yourself, and can a
cupful to your sister, and bring what
wheat-ears she and you have gathered to
my little heap''

'' Michael ?" echoed the old man, " your
husband's name was William ! How came
you to call his son Michael ? But the name
belongs to your family perhaps ; — your
father, or some favourite brother ?"

'' No," replied the widow, " it was fora
different reason. A very dear kinsman
of my husband's bore that name, and in
token of love and gratitude to him, and in
fulfilment of an old promise, so our only
son was christened."

^^ I remember," muttered the cripple to
himself, " I remember William said that
his first boy should bear my name, and
I think he wrote to that effect after the
child was born ; but the letter must have
arrived at that time of misery." Then
rousing himself, and turning to the gentle
creature, whom a feeling of unusual interest
still detained at his side, he added
aloud, " I do remember now that William
Leslie had an uncle called Michael Noms,
but what peculiar cause of gratitude "

^^ What cause I" interrupted Mrs. Leslie;
" a thousand causes : from a mere infant,
when I have heard my husband say that
he gave him the first shilling he ever possessed,
— that kind uncle, absent or present,
was his good genius. He insisted upon
his being sent to Belford School ; paid
himself for masters, whom his guardians
thought superfluous ; rescued him from
the frantic frenzy of his stepfather ; saved
his life at the utmost peril of his own,
from the furious assaults of that wretched
madman ; placed him in the paper-mill,
which, but for the rash speculations of
his partner, would have been not merely
a comfortable income for himself, but an
affluent provision for his family ; aod,
last and dearest kindness, when William,
with his characteristic generosity, loved
a poor girl, the portionless orphan of a
naval officer, when interested connexions
and officious friends all opposed the union.

did not he, from across the wide ocean,
send himself not merely his approbation of
the destined marriage, but a portion for
the destitute bride ? I never saw him,"
continued Mrs. Leslie, in a lower tone than
that which had been dictated by her enthusiastic
recollection of her benefactor's
goodness ; '^ but night and morning I have
prayed for him, and night and morning do
my poor children join in those prayers ;
and my dear husband, amongst his latest

words ''

'' Did he pray for the uncle who seemed
to have forgotten him ?" asked the old
man, his voice half-stifled with emotion.
*' Look, Margaret," added he, stripping up
his sleeve and showing a deep scar extending
diagonally across his left arm ; " this
scar was received from the knife with which
his furious and ft-antic stepfather was pursuing
William Leslie. I am Michael Xorris.
You will not disdain to acknowledge the

cripple who comes to your door hungry and
ragged. Here, too," said he, taking from
his pocket a bundle of papers, '^ are characters
that you well know."

Tearfully yet joyfully the ami-hearted
and grateful Margaret returned the embraces
of her venerable kinsman, presented
her three children to him one by one, and
replied to his questions as to their change
of circumstances.

It needed few words to tell the story.
nothing is more rapid than a descent. The
rolling of a stone down a hill is a true type
of falling fortune. Taking advantage of
a long illness with which T^^illiam Leslie
was afflicted, his partner engaged in desperate
speculations. They failed. The
rash speculator absconded, and William remained,
a bankrupt without a friend or
resource. Honest to the last, his ^vife resigned
her small settlement to satisfy the
creditors. His debts being paid, he had
tried every means of lining, and whilst

he retained his health had supported
his family by the most persevering industry
; but a fever, occasioned by overexertion,
had come on; his constitution,
impaired by anxiety and labour, had
been unable to resist the attack, and since
that period the wife who had been the
faithful partner of his cares and his toils,
had at least so far succeeded as to maintain
her children without the assistance of
charity whether public or private.

Why not have written to me when
this bankruptcy took place?" inquired the
uncle.

" Alas, dear sir ! we had before heard
of that terrible hurricane, in which"

" In which," said the old man, filling
up with stern composure the sudden pause
that from a mixture of delicacy and sympathy
had arrested Margaret Leslie's words
'ein which the plantation where resided
was laid waste, my house levelled
with the ground, and my wife with four

hopeful children in the ruins ! In striving
to rescue them, this thigh," — striking the
withered limb with a hazel-twig — " this
thigh was broken. I owe my preservation to
the gratitude of an emancipated negro ; but
for months, for years, all life, all nature was
a blank before me ! I have sometimes wondered
how I could have survived such a
blow ! For what purpose I was spared !
The doubt was sinful, and finds its rebuke,
its thrice merciful rebuke, in this blissful
hour. You heard then of my losses, dear
Margaret ? Poor William heard of them ?"
" We were sure that something must
have gone amiss, from receiving no reply
to the letter which announced the birth of
our boy, and claimed your promise of
standing godfather at his christening.
William did not like to write again upon
such an occasion ; it would have seemed
like encroaching upon your too generous
spirit. But when the news of that awful

hurricane arrived, and Nicholas Hume and
the Collins made inquiries in London
and ascertained that your plantation had
indeed been amongst those laid waste, —
then your <sound>silence</sound> was too well explained !
I heard this sad news first ; for it arrived
during the dreadful illness which preceded
my husband's bankruptcy. And when he
regained so much breathing-time after his
own misfortunes as to ask news of you, no
tidings could be obtained ; all trace of you
seemed lost. Oh that he had lived to see
this day ! HIS will be done ! But oh
that my poor husband had but lived to see
once more the kinsman he loved so well !"

The old man pressed her hand in
speechless emotion, and .Margaret, smiling
through hers, went on : —

'' You must live with us, dear uncle, and
we shall wait upon you and work for you,
and be happy together — as happy as we
can be without him — after all. My Annie

is a good gii'l — oh, such a good girl ! and
pretty, is she not dear uncle ? — and poor
Michael, your namesake, is a boy of a
thousand. We have had much to be
thankful for. Farmer Rogers, the overseer,
whose books my husband kept (little Michael
keeps them now, as well the farmer
says as his father did), supplies us with
milk twice a- day. Mrs. Lascelles, the
Rector's wife, employs Annie and me constantly
in needlework for her large family;
and if we can but keep our pretty cottage
if we can but keep that cottage at whose
porch poor William planted the honeysuckle
and the China rose, and the vine
which now half covers the thatch — that
cottage where we worked and <sound>wept</sound> together,
and where he died the death of the
righteous — if we can but live together-there,
within sight of the turf that covers
his dear remains, I should ask for nothing
better on this side the graves'

The widow's tears flowed afresh, and
once again the old man pressed her hand.

Is there any doubt of your retaining
this beloved habitation, dear Margaret ?
And does my coming cause that doubt ?"

"Oh no ! no ! dear uncle, not in the
slightest degree. The cause of doubt is,
that we have no lease, and that Miss
Collins, as she calls herself, poor
William's cousin, wants it for some purpose
or other ; people say with some view
of marrying. But this is idle talk, —
village gossip. ^Yhat is certain is, that
she wishes to take it, and is willing to
give two pounds a-year more rent than I
now give or can afford to give. If our old
landlord, Mr. Godfrey, had stayed, he
and Lady Elizabeth had promised that I
should remain ; but the Hall, and the village,
and the whole estate are sold, and
the new lord of the manor is coming this
evening. Hark ! you may hear the bells

<sound>ringing</sound> even now. Mr. Godfrey and Lady
Elizabeth intend staying a few days at the
rectory : you saw them ride by with
their dogs : they have promised to speak
in my favour to the new landlord ; they
mentioned it even now, and the good
rector and his excellent lady will second
my petition : still — "

"Ee of good cheer, Margaret ! Even if
you should leave your pretty" cottage, I
would wager something — " The old man
checked himself, and resumed in an indifferent
tone, "Who is the new lord of
the manor ? What is his name ?

^^ The property was purchased by a Mr.
Price ; but he is understood to be an
agent, and I have not heard the name
of the real proprietor, who is said to be an
elderly gentleman, and so rich that he
will hardly be tempted to turn an old
tenant from her cottage for so trifling an
addition of rent. Nevertheless — "

Once again, Margaret, be of good
heart !" reiterated her uncle.

'' The tenants are to meet him in the
avenue : the farmers and their sons on
horseback ; the cottagers, women, and
children, on foot. Ought I to join them ?
I have no shame in honest labour, but I
do shrink from meeting the scorn of those
purse-proud kindred who — " and poor
Margaret's tears fell fast. Ought I to be
there, dear uncle ? 1 will go or stay as
you direct."

^^ Go, Margaret ! Go, and fear nothing.
Gather up your treasures : the jug, whose
generous draught was the sweetest I ever
quaffed ; the wheat-ears ; and the cradle
with its crowing babe, — blessings on its
dear face ! Go boldly. I will not shame
you by these unseemly rags ; but will
rest awhile under the friendly shade of
the hazel, while you return home and prepare
for the procession. Be sure that you

fail not. "We shall meet again soon, dear
ones. For the present, farewell."

And something there was about the old
man, ragged, sick, and lame as he was,
that Margaret found it impossible to disobey.
So, heartened up, she knew not
why (for many have felt, without being
able to give the feeling its true name, the
mingled power of sympathy and appreciation
to comfort and to cheer), she called
about her her blooming children and departed;
Annie and herself bearing the
cradle between them, and the boy laden
with the gleanings of the day.

The setting sun gleamed brightly between
the noble elms that formed the
beautiful avenue to Cotton Hall, gilding
the rugged branches and turning into pendent
emeralds the leaves of the branches
which met across the wide carriage-road ;
met and interleaved in a lengthened archway
that might well have suggested the

VOL. III. I

ricci intricacies of a cathedral aisle in the
proudest days of Gothic architecture.
The village bells pealed amain, horses
pranced, flags waved, the children of the
parish-schools strewed the gaudy flowers
of early autumn; and as the carriage
of the new lord of the manor rolled between
the ivied lodges to the grey old
Hall, a quaint irregular structure of Elizabeth's
or James's days, with a tame peacock
sunning himself on the stone balustrade,
a large old English spaniel basking
on the steps, and the tenants in their
holiday apparel grouped around the porch,
an artist, whether painter or poet, might
have envied the accident which produced
an arrangement so felicitously picturesque.
Something of this feeling, however,
unperceived or unguessed by herself,
mingled with the natural emotions of
curiosity and interest in our friend Margaret's
bosom, as, standing humbly apart

between her two elder children, with her
infant in her arms, under a large sycamore,
she gazed around upon the scene, and
perceived, gaily adorned in the extreme
of the country fashion, the rival candidate
for her beloved cottage — the buxom
landlady of the Eed Lion, surrounded by
the unfriendly kindred of her late husband.
Neither Margaret nor her "William had
ever applied for assistance to these people;
and yet she knew instinctively that some
from pride and some from shame felt the
<sound>silent</sound> reproach of her unassisted poverty
and her blameless life — that all wished
her absence, and would contribute as far
as in them lay to turn her from her home ;
and in spite of the encouraging influence
of her lately-knovm kinsman's cheering
forebodings, her heart sank within her as
the door of the carriage was thrown open.
An elderly gentleman, very neatly dressed,
but pallid, emaciated, and lame, was

I 2

assisted by his servants up the two low
steps that led to the porch. Having
ascended them with some difficulty, he
turned round, took off his hat, bowed with
a gracious smile to the assembly, and then
paused, as if in search of some one whom
he expected to see.

The effect of this apparition was a start
of surprise and horror from the portly
landlady, seldom equalled on the stage or
off; her brother the haberdasher, who had
just flourished his hat preparatory to leading
the general cheer, let it fall in dismay,
looking the curses which his habitual hypocrisy
scarce repressed ; cousin Anthony,
the rich miserable miser, smothered a
<sound>groan</sound> ; and Nicholas Hume, in spite of his
consummate impudence, fairly stole away.
What in the meanwhile did our friends
in their humble nook under the sycamore ?
Little Michael danced for joy ; Annie <sound>clapped</sound>
her hands ; and poor Margaret, for the

t^yelltietll time during the last six hours,
<sound>burst</sound> into tears — tears, this time, however,
of unmingled joy.

" Mrs. Leslie ! Margaret ! my dear
niece I" cried Michael, or, as we may now
call him, Mr. XoiTis, advancing to meet
her; " to you alone of all my relations now
living do I owe any account of my motives
for coming amongst you as I have done today.
With the rest of my kindred I have
done for ever. But I also owe some explanation
to my tenants and future neighbours.
You all know that I left England
about fifty years ago, a poor and friendless
lad. I returned nearly thirty years afterwards,
with riches honestly obtained, the
happy husband of a wealthy and excellent
woman, , and the father of four hopeful
children. I came to Cotton ; found my
relations, some indigent, some comfortably
situated ; did what good I could amongst
them ; and went back to Jamaica, with

the view at some future clay of placing
my sons at the head of my plantations in
that island, and coming home to die in my
native village. A hurricane passed over
the estate where I. lived, destroying my
dwelling, my wife, my children, and almost
myself. Tor many years I was dead
to the world ; but care had been taken of
the large property that remained to me,
and, when, by God's mercy, I was restored
to health, mental and bodily, I found myself
rich indeed, so far as money was
concerned — richer than ever ; but in the
blessed charities of life most poor — a childless,
desolate, bereaved old man. I knew
that a report had gone abroad that I was
ruined by the hurricane, and I resolved to
prove the relations I had left in England, by
coming amongst them in seeming poverty.
I have done so, and the experiment has
answered well. And now, my dearest
niece, I need not tell you that the cottage

is yours ; but for the second time to-day I
throw myself upon your charity. You will
not abandon me because I happen to be
rich ? You will never have the heart to do
so? You remember your promise that
we should Eve together ; and come with
those dear child-en to brighten and gladden
the old Hal."

The pleasant 'st angling is to see the fish
Cut-with her golden oars the silver stream,
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
So angle we for Beatrice."

Shakspeare

Wherefore so sad and <sound>silent</sound>, Helen
mine ?" was the question of the fair
Agnes Montresor to her fairer cousin, the
daughter and heir of the Lord Scope,
as followed by a goodly retinue of waiting
gentlewomen, gi-rooms, and pages, they
threaded, with a solemn dignity that
might have done honour to elder dames,

the narrow winding woodland path that
divided the glassy mere, at the side of
which they had been flying their falcons,
from the ample park, dotted with noble
groups of venerable oaks, bathed in the
sunshine that surrounded the baron's
stately mansion of Beau-empire.

"What hath troubled thee, Helen,
that thou fittest on thy jennet as mute
as the merlin on thy wrist ? Art thou
wroth with thyself for chiding the young
Lord Devereux from thy bridle rein ? or
alack that a knight so lately from the
gay court of France should know so little
how to construe a fair maiden's wishes
when her words say one thing and her
looks another ! — is that same Arthur
Devereux fallen into thy disgrace for too
readily obeying thy behests ? What aileth
thee, sweet cousin, thou the heir of those
broad lands ; for whose fair grace the
champion strives in the lists, and the minstrel

at the board ; thou to hang drooping
over thy saddle bow, as sad as a turtledove
that hath lost her mate — whilst I,
thy poor kinswoman, and thy very bower-maidens,
Margaret and Cicely, are as blithe
as so many larks ! Fie on thee sweet
cousin ! This wayward humour is flat treason
against thy happier destiny ! Betrothed
too to the man whom thou best lowest ! at
the king's command ! and with thy lord
and father's approval !"

'' Why, there it is !" responded the fair
Helen, suddenly reining in her palfrey,
and turning towards her cousin with an
air of desolation that contrasted strongly
with the sprightly demeanour of her young
kinswoman : ^^ Have I not cause enow for
melancholy, think' st thou, to be bestowed
by the king's behest upon the lord Devereux,
so that love me, or love me not, he
must needs espouse me ? And to be the
daughter and heir of a wealthy baron, into

whose ear all men seem bounden to pour
false feigning ! oh. ! that I were as little
in debt to fortune as thou art, Agnes,
that I might for once hear words of truth!"

And the pretty spoilt child <sound>sighed</sound> ; and
it may be — for I suspect that the sad rogue
called Human Mature played beauties and
heiresses the same tricks in the days of
bluff king Hal as in the reign of our sovereign
lady Victoria — it may be that she
really thought she should prefer truth to
flattery, even from the lips of the Lord
Devereux.

Her cousin smiled with some archness.
Perhaps she perceived, or thought she perceived,
that what the fair heiress really
wanted was praise in a newer and more
piquant form.

'^jSTay, an thy melancholy have no deeper
root than a lover's courtesy, sweet Coz,
I'll gage my velvet hood against thy broidered
wimple that I find thee a medicine

Hearken, Helen ! — This brisk October
wind is gathering to a tempest. The
golden leaves of this close beechen alley-are
falling about our ears ; and the clouds
gathering above our heads as though the
very blessed skies were part and parcel of
our council. The rain that 'monisheth us
to seek shelter will drive the falconers
from their sport by the mere. Put thy
steed to his full pace, dearest ! We must
win afore these gallants to the great hall
of Beau-empire ; and there thou must hide
thee behind the warder's great carved
chair. — No ! Into ! — Sit thee down there,
as though overwrought by the sport and the
riding, and fall asleep ; that were the cunning
device ; and then when the Lord
Devereux espyeth his lady and mistress,
as he and my varlet, Philip Poynings, pass
through with their hawks, mark an he
speak not as soothfastly as if thou wert thy
poor penniless kinswoman with no dower

but her merry heart, instead of the rich
heir of the Lord Scope."

So said ; so done. The fair cousins rode
as for life and death ; and not only reached
the goodly mansion of Beau-empire before
the party from the lake, but had plenty of
time to adjust the lady Helen's costume
and position, so that she should enact the
part of Sleeping Beauty as naturally and
becomingly as possible, That the attitude
was natural, she had satisfactory proof after
Agnes and her waiting woman had retired.
Her old nurse, passing accidentally that
way, haying testified a nurse-like anxiety
on the score of her catching cold, and even
evinced some disposition to awaken her byway
of averting the danger; whilst the
good Baron her father, happening also to
cross the hall, and seeing his darling, as he
believed, asleep, took incredible pains to
mitigate his iron tread, and stifle, as far as
possible, the jingling of sword and spur.

lest he should disturb her slumbers. In
short, so admirable was the counterfeit,
that the only person (except those in the
secret) not taken in was the Baron's favourite
mastiff, Wolf, who looked up in her
face with an expression which seemed at
once to detect the counterfeit, and to wonder,
like an honest animal as he was, what
could be the possible motive for such a
deceit.

At last, according to Agnes's prediction.
Lord Devereux and Sir Philip Poynings
entered the hall, and after some talk of the
falcon flown and the game taken, of jesses
and lures, and a certain beagle called Don-celle,
and a riding palfrey, hight Lancelot,
the good knight appeared suddenly to perceive
the fair lady who filled so drowsily
the "Warder's chair.

"Ha! thy bonneville !'' said he in alow
voice.

Although her eyes were closed, Helen

felt with absolute certainty that Lord
Devereux glanced towards her, and she
also felt, she knew not how, that he
smiled.

*' She looketh well asleep I" continued
the knight.

'^ Indifferent well !" resounded his companion,
in a voice as chilling as his words.

She's a fair damsel," quoth Sir Philip.

*^ Indifferent fair!" was the response.

And hath a light foot in a coranto."

'indifferent Hight."

" And a sweet voice in a virelai."

'' Indifferent—"

Nay," interrupted the knight ; '' thou
art a very heretic in the matter of beauty,
an Infidel, a Pagan. Thy very blood is
frozen, that thou speaks thus of one of
the fairest maidens of King Henry's Court.
If the Lady Helen be not a beauty where
wilt thou find one ?"

*• The damsel is indifferent fair," replied

the Lord Devereux quietly. '^ But the
Lady Katherine Sands hath a finer shape,
and the Lady Pierce a prettier foot.
And, for a virelai or a coranto commend
me to the bright-eyed Provencal, the
burgher's wife of Lyons. Beauty quotha !
Thou talk est like the Squire of Dames in
the legend. Ha ! The rain pours down
amain. Come and I'll show thee a suit of
Milan armour fit to have figured at the
Field of the Cloth of Gold. Or, we'll
have a bout with the rapiers, or what
thou wilt ! There's a good hour yet
to dinner. Thou'lt beat me at the rapier.
I have not tried my weapon against one so
well skilled as thyself this half year. Come,
it lacks an hour of noon, we shall have
time to breathe ourselves." And ofi^ the
Lord Devereux marched, just soon enough
to save his betrothed from the imminent
danger of proving her admiration of frank
speaking, and her severe love of truth, by

an explosion of tears, or of scolding — or,
by'r Lady, by inflicting upon the cheek of
her lover such a slap from her fair hand
as, half a century later, was no uncommon
act of grace from good Queen Bess to her
more favoured courtiers !

Poor Helen ! From this risk she was
happily saved ; and when they met at the
banquet the recusant had nothing worse to
encounter than cold monosyllables and
averted eyes. The storm still continued
to rage without, and in spite of his ladylove's
declaration that she was ill at ease,
both Lord Devereux and Sir Philip Mornings
followed the damsels to the large, low,
pleasant chamber, with the rich gilding of
its panelled walls, its bay windows and
carved chimney, where the young kinswomen,
surrounded by their female attendants,
pursued their several avocations
at the tapestry loom or the broidery frame.
For the first five minutes a dead <sound>silence</sound>
VOL in. K

reigned in the apartment. The Lady Helen
was what an enemy would have called
sullen, and a friend would have dignified
by the name of melancholy; and her
handmaidens dutifully followed their
lady's example. Agnes was the first
to speak, whilst her cousin was now
amusing herself with entangling her gold
and silver threads under the notion of
winding them, and now filling up a rosebud
with blue silk and a pansy with
crimson.

"Hast thou no French roundelay, or
English madrigal to sing or to say, my
good Lord Devereux ? Xo minstrel tale,
or courtly jest to grace thy lady's bower ?"

^^ Say, how chanced the wooing betwixt
Maximilian de Montmorency, and Marguerite
de Bethany ?" said Poynings, aiding
his fair mistress in her attempt to bring
about conversation; ^^when I left the
Chateau of St. Germains, Mademoiselle

had taken it into that silly head of hers
that the Count wooed her for her broad
lands and the more he courted and flattered
the more she disbelieved, until at
last 'twas a moot point whether the pretty
heiress would not fling herself, and her
fiefs and vineyards, olive grounds and all
into a nunnery, from mere distrust and
suspicion. What might be the end of that
love passage, Arthur ?''

'' Why the little damsel improved day
by day in mistrust and jealousy until, as
thou say'st, 'twere a chance but she took
refuge in the chiux-h from poor maximilian's
luckless courtship. And so it
chanced that one fair summer morning
standing beside a close planted arbour, a
pleached bower of rose and woodbine, the
Chevalier harcourt, and Jules de Mon-there
began to banter the Count on his
mistrusting mistress. ' 'Tis pity of her,'
quoth the Chevalier, ' for of a surety she's

X 2

the fairest lady in France.' 'Nay,' replied
Maximilian, hortense du Plessis
hath brighter eyes ; and Dine de
Beauties a sweeter smile ; Leocadie de
Blonde ville hath a finer shape; and
for a hand and foot, the young Countess
what name had followed none can tell
for the fair Marguerite darted from the
arbour, and Montmorency, who had known
all the while that she was listening, caught
her in his arms — aye, even as I shall catch
another listener, and said — Oh fairest,
sweetest, dearest, how may I tell what he
said, when I am thinking of none save
thee ! Of naught save that entire and
perfect love which belonged not to thy
father's broad lands, nor even to thy surpassing
beauty, bit to thine own most dear
and precious self" — and catching her in
his arms, his lip touched — did it touch ? —
her snowy brow.

** Xo, there was no traitor, no treachery,"

continued he, answering the half murmured
question which stole forth amidst her blushes
and smiles. '^ I was wending disconsolately
among the beechen trees within
hearing of my lady love, when mistress
Agnes's device tempted me into a counter
trial of sauciness. But I am pardoned !
Full surely I am pardoned, and if ever
again thou should'st mistrust my love or
thine own beauty, thou hast but to take a
nap in the "harder's chair ! "

Beaumont and Fletcher.

And do you really intend to walk out
on this wind ?" said Caroline Selby, the
only daughter and heiress of Lady Selby,
of Selby Park, to her young cousin, Lucy
More, a London girl, who had recently
arrived on a visit at the Park, and who,
emancipated for almost the first time in
her life from the restraints and confinement

of a great city, enjoyed the liberty
and fresh air of the country, with a zest
which her delicate and luxurious kinswoman
had some difficulty in comprehending.
" Can you really venture to face
this wind?"

Can I !" replied Lucy, gaily, " can I
not ? Did not you promise me only last
night to shew me your flowers and your
birds, your conservatories and greenhouses,
and hot-houses and flower-garden,
your aviary and your pleasantry ? And
did not my aunt charge me not to let you
forget your promise, and to go to none of
them without you ? Confess this, Caroline.
And what but wind — bright, keen, sunny,
invigorating wind — can we look for in the
blowy month of March? Did you never
hear Sheridan's rhyming calendar ? —

"January snowy ;
February flow ;
March blowy ;
April showery ;

May flowery ;
June bowery ;
July poppy ;
August croppy ;
September poppy ;
October breezy ;
November wheezy ;
December freely."

^^Why one would as soon object to the
sun in June ; as to the wind — the rough
pleasant wind — that sends one home,
running, glowing, <sound>laughing</sound> at one knows
not what in this same month of March. Eut
perhaps you object to the sun in the
summer ?"

Certainly," replied Caroline, gravely ;
I never go out in the summer, except,
indeed, for a drive in the pony phaeton ;
as to walking, I never dream of such a
thing."

" Never walk in the summer!" exclaimed
Lucy ; " live in this beautiful
place, which we poor Londoners think it a

privilege only to see, and be content to
drive about in a carriage ! Oh, my dear
cousin, what woukl we give for these
lawns to run about in I And you really
do not walk ? Can such a thing be possible!"


" I very seldom do walk, as I said
before," replied Miss Selby ; 'rand most
certainly I am not going out this morning.
And I can't imagine why you should wish
to go, to get coarse, and sunburnt, and
freckled in this wind, when you know
that next Monday is my birthday, and weare
to have half the country at our
children's ball !"

Well I" said Lucy, suppressing a smile;
" I grant the importance of looking well at
the ball, especially for you who are its
heroine. But are you not afraid of growing
wan and pale for want of exercise,
sitting all day after lessons are done,
poring over this embroidery, and making

SO dismal a Avast of floss silk and gold
thread ! Come and show me the pheasants
and the flowers, if only for the sake of
your complexion."

Oh, no !" rejoined her cousin, *^ one
has always exercise enough with skipping
and the dumb-bells ; and just now I have
to practise my shawl dance, which Charlotte
Grist brought out at her benefit, and
which I have promised mamma to dance
on "Wednesday ; — ^no fear of my wanting
exercise, I promise you."

"And you really won't come then!"
exclaimed Lucy, somewhat disappointed.
"Well, perhaps the day may be calmer
tomorrow, for Lady Selby desired me not
to go to the garden or the aviary without
you, and of course I shall not think of disobeying
her. I dare say the wind will be
stiller tomorrow; and in the meantime
I'll hunt up the old bailiff*, and get him to
give me a lesson in agriculture, so that I

may not mistake wheat for grass again, as
happened yesterday, to the immortal honour
of my eockneyship. It's a mercy I did
not take the contents of the field for a crop
of clover or turnips ; for they being all
green, the thing might have happened !"
added Lucy, as she ran away <sound>laughing</sound> at
her own blunders, the gayest and happiest
creature that ever gladdened that often
dull place — a <sound>quiet</sound> home in a great city.

Lucy Moore had the unspeakable advantage
of being the daughter of a man
of considerable talent and limited income.
Her father was a barrister, who had at last,
by patience and assiduity, won through
the long probation which that most difficult
and uncertain of all professions requires in
England, andwas now rapidly rising in practice
and in reputation ; but as his private
sortie was small, and his family large, he
continued to live in the most prudent and
moderate style ; so that his daughter, unspoilt

either by over-indulgence or over-education
(those two dangers of the children of the
rich), accustomed to make her own amusements,
and to find gratification in the
humblest pleasures, brought into the country
those two prime requisites for enjoyment, a
healthy mind and a healthy body.

Her cousin, on the other hand, the
petted heiress of a wealthy and widowed
mother, and the flattered pupil of a
fashionable governess, was already, at
thirteen, a complete specimen of a modern
fine lady, vain, selfish, indolent, and only
to be roused into exertion by the desire
of display. Lady Selby, idolizing mother
though she were, had yet, upon a casual
visit to her sister, been struck with the
difference between the fretful languor of
Caroline and the good-humoured cheerfulness
of her cousin ; and had invited Lucy
to the park, with a latent, though unacknowledged,
wish that the animation



and sweetness which she found so delightful,
might prove contagious, and partly,
from a desire to keep the girls constantly-together,
partly from a hint of her family
physician on the advantage of air and
exercise, arose the charge to Lucy not to
visit the conservatory or the flower garden,
the pleasantry, or the aviary, without
Miss Caroline.

Well, however, as Lucy loved flowers
and birds, and much as she lead heard of
the splendour of her cousin's collection, she
contrived to And plenty of amusement in
her morning's walk without their aid.
Her friend, the old bailiff*, enraptured
with her frankness, her gaiety, her intelligence,
and her ignorance (for the youthful
ignorance that seeks for information is
always charming), led her half over his
own territory, the Home Farm, and not
only gave her the despised instruction on
grains and gi-asses, but volunteered a

lesson on shrubs and trees, and timber in
general, from the budding hazel to the
rugged oak ; to which his little grandson,
a lad of about nine years of age, who
accompanied them, added a practical
lecture on those inhabitants of treetops,
called birds, and their sayings and
doings in the shape of songs and bird-nests
; so that between her two companions,
Edward and his grandfather,
Lucy had never been more gratified.

This happened on a Tuesday. Wednesday
was still windy, and Caroline was still
indisposed for any exercise but that of the
shawl-dance, so that Lucy was fain to
have recourse to the escort of Edward,
who had arrived to offer his services, with
a present of a string of birds' eggs, half •
a-dozen yards long, his prime treasure,
which, had it been a rope of pearls, he
would equally have offered, so completely
had Lucy's sweet manners won his heart.

He was but too happy to accompany her
about the park, and show her the dells
where the primroses grew thickest, and
the sunny banks where the purple violets
literally coloured the ground.

Thursday was damp ; and Caroline,
afraid of taking cold, stuck to her embroidery
and her shawl dance.

Friday was cold ; and still Miss Caroline
dared not venture.

Saturday was sunny, intolerably sunny ;
and the fair heiress feared for her complexion.


Sunday, the weather was perfect, neither
windy, nor sunny, nor damp, nor cold ; but
Miss Selby, having ridden to church in a
close carriage, discovered, that having
been out once that morning, she could not
go out again.

Monday was the day of the ball, when
of course its young heroine never dreamt
of encountering additional fatigue, and

Lucy, returning from her ramble, was
thinking, with mingled pleasure and
amusement, that after that evening she
would stand some chance of seeing the
birds and the flowers, which she had now
been a week in the Home without catching
a glimpse of, and that at all events she
would, after that night, see no more of
the shawl-dance, of which (all Charlotte as
Caroline thought herself) her cousin began
to be a little weary; when, on entering
the hall, she found the whole family in
confusion and dismay, surgeons sent for,
the ball postponed, and the entire household
in consternation. Practising the
eternal shawl-dance, and using for the
first time the new and splendid scarf
which had been sent from London for the
purpose. Miss Selby's foot had caught in
the drapery, and after refraining for a
whole week to go a hundred yards from
the hall-door with her visitor, in order to
preserve herself in beauty for this ball, a

worse misfortune than taking cold, or
looking worse, or tanned, or freckled had
befallen the fair Terpsichore, — she had
sprained her ankle, and the famous dance remained
enhanced, and the festival was put
aside, whilst its poor heroine continued
during the showery month of April,
and the flowery May, just lifted from her
bed to the sofa, fretting over her compelled,
and therefore irksome, confinement,
and longing for nothing so much as the
power of getting out with Lucy, her kind
and tender nurse, to the conservatory and
the pleasantry, the aviary, and the flower-garden,
making ^Tii;uous resolutions against
indolence and shawl-dances, and agreeing
in the sage moral deduced by her cousin,
from this accident — that nothing: can be
worse for young ladies, or, for the matter
of that, for old ones either, than the power
of having at all times and on all occasions
completely their own way.

VOL. III. L

A CHAPTER FROM THE CHRONICLES OF
ADLERSBERG.

My high-blown pride

At length broke under me.

Shakspeare.

Part I.

Showed HOW THE LADY ERMENGARDE
EARNED FOR HERSELF THAT ILL TITLE OF
THE PROUD LADY.

There are few midwinter nights seemingly
SO long or so dreary as the one
fragrant hour between a July moon-set
and day-dawn was felt to be by one lonely
watcher in the beleaguered Tower of
Adlersberg, the aged and pious Cistercian,
Father Cyril. It was no light fear that

could cause the good monk to quail and
tremble with apprehension, through that
fairest and freshest of summer hours, when
the dew, a natural rosary, hangs impearled
upon the tree of the forest and the herb of
the field, calling sinful souls to prayer and
praise, ^o light or vain imaginings could
so perturb his spirit ; for he had been
accustomed to sharp penances, being a
man by nature of rebellious passions ;
one who, as folk have told even certain of
the aged brethren of St. Basil, his own
convent, had in his time undergone fierce
and frequent struggles with the evil one,
loth to quit his hold upon so strong a
heart : but what he thought, or what he
felt, or what he feared, during that weary
space when the sand passed once through
the hour glass as he knelt before the window
looking out beyond the grim battlements
of the tower, repeating again and
again, with his lips, the Ave to which no

l2

effort could bend this mind — the desperate
fear of that hour was sorer to abide than
fast or vigil, hair-cloth or scourge, or the
far harder conflict with the foe within,
the worldly desires and revengeful promptings
which had darkened the days of his
Riot youth.

Xo sound of succour yet !" muttered
he ; " and scarce the faintest streak of day
in the east ! Oh, Holy Mother ! bring
on the dawn ere I perish of expectation !
Conrad ! Oswald ! Methinks I hear a stir
beneath the walls amongst our besiegers.
They keep true watch ; whilst our varlet —
Conrad ! I say ; Oswald ! Theodore ! They
heed me not, worn out, poor knaves, with
the assault of yester-eve. An' Egbert were
here, he would have heard me ! Oh, if
this coming day bring not the Landgrave
to our aid, then, blessed Virgin ! I dare
not think of what will follow. Look down
upon us, Mary, full of grace ! Save this

innocent maiden from the false Baron, who,
partly to possess himself of her broad
lands, partly to avenge her refusal of his
proffered hand, hath set himself down
before her castle, with mercenaries from
far lands, — bowmen from the Cantons,
lancers from the Thine — the swarthy sons
of the south and the fair-haired Dane
have joined the league ; and swears —
shame to knighthood I — that ere the siege
be raised the Lady Ermengarde shall sue
to him, aye, on her bended knee, to plight
the troth she spurned so haughtily, whilst

he That <sound>noise</sound> again ! It is too surely

the trampling of feet, the <sound>clattering</sound> of

armour, the bursting Hark I AMiat

<sound>sound</sound> is that ? Of a surety the great
gates be creaking on their hinges. The
foe will be upon us ere I can ^varn the
noble maiden, or gather her defenders
around her." And, snatching up a huge
sword, Father Cyril departed on his double

errand of seeking the Lady Ermengarde
and collecting the over worn vassals and
domestics, who, under the command of the
seneschal, had hitherto held the besiegers
at bay, expecting every day the relief
which now seemed hopeless.

Trembling with age, and his own impatient
spirit chafing at the wrong he
lacked power to redress, the monk tottered
through a long stone hall which pierced
the castle from east to west, when he was
Stayed by a sight piteous to look upon.
The Lady Ermengarde, worn by the
watching and misery of this cruel and
obstinate siege (when was ever maiden
beset so rudely for her broad lands and
her strong towers ?), had been seized by
slumber ; she, that coy and stately maiden,
even in the open gallery chamber, where
men-at-arms might be each instant passing
to and fro. She had fallen into a inside
chair, and was now as fast asleep as though

the sister angels, Love and Peace, kept
watch beside her pillow. Dolefully wan
was her cheek, as if the pale maiden roses
had been washed white with bitter tears,
and her long yellow hair, all upbraided,
hung round her like a veil. Her rich garments
were disordered and stained. 'None
who had seen her then would have called
Her by the name she had borne to her
present undoing, the Proud Lady of Adders
None would have believed that such
a title could have belonged to one so gentle
and so sad ! All the sadder seemed her
sleep for the faint smile that lingered
round her lips. Few were in the castle
save untrained lacqueys and rude grooms,
sorry protectors, even had their numbers
equalled those of their assailants ; whilst,
without the walls, pressed onward that
audacious baron and his riotous soldiery,
resolute to storm the castle and bear away
the heir : and yet there she sat in her loveliness,

drooping and pallid as a lily broken
down by a summer shower ; but with such
a look of peace and love as if her cheek
were resting upon her mother's bosom.

Father Cyril bent over that fair form.
He could not pass her without a prayer ;
and the tears would fall from his aged^eyes
upon her slender hands, unconscious as
she was of his presence or his sympathy.
But the prayer and the tears were stayed
by surprise; as, in spite of the close-coming
peril — every passing instant
making it clearer that the foe was astir
beneath, the monk could not choose but
start and bless himself as he bethought
him of the waywardness of woman's will,
whilst he gazed upon a quaintly fashioned
oaken cross nestled in the white bosom,
which, if court gossips said truth, had disdained
to wear a carkanet of ruby stones
proffered by the hand of a king's son.

Now, there belonged to that small

oaken cross the old tale of love repaid by
scorn, of high-born beauty looking disdainfully
at lowly faith, of patient service
and insolent rebuke, which makes one of
the darkest and thorniest pathways of the
tangled labyrinth called life. And sure
tale is it, and sad as true : The cabin
looks across the valley to the castle, and
says, We both contain human hearts ; and
the castle — Ah, well-a-day for woman's
haughtiness, said I not that she was called
the Proud Lady of Adlersberg.

Egbert with the raven locks was the
son of the Lady's falconer, almost he
might have been called her foster-brother,
since, an orphan from her earliest days,
his mother was the Lady Emiengarde's
nurse. Nevertheless the boy was so much
older than the fair girl as to bestow upon
him the privilege of enacting the part of
her protector, in the sports of their
childish days. His father, old Heinrich,

was, as I have said, the falconer of ;
what place the youth Egbert
filled were hard to tell. By his good
leave, none but himself should have served
his fair mistress. He alone tended her
favourite hawks. The tassel gentil from
IS'orway, that the Emperor rode fifty
leagues to see strike down her quarts,
was of Egbert's training ; Egbert held her
greyhound in his silken leash ! none, save
Egbert, taught her jennet his paces, or
held her bridle rein. The very pinks and
cauliflowers that grew in a nook beside the
north bastion — Alack, the hoof of the
war-horse hath trampled it low ! — were of
Egbei-t's tending. He brought her a dappled
fawn, whose dam had been killed by
some Eobin Hood of the Black Forest ;
and even whilst echoing her maledictions
on the heartless churl who had orphaned
her spotted favourite, he climbed the
topmost bough of a stately beech to steal

for her the golden couplets of the turtledove
— emblems too true of his despairing
passion! In early youth, almost
in boyhood, he had twice, so said the
bower-women, saved his fair mistress's
life: once in the chase, when the boar
stood fiercely at bay, and Egbert came
between the furious animal and the Lady
Ermengarde, and stretched the fierce and
dangerous quarry dead at her feet ; and
again, when autumn rains had swollen
the summer brook to a torrent, and her
parley, borne along by the strong current,
lost his footing, and was carried
helplessly doT\TL the stream. Oh, how
Egbert plunged into those deep waters I
how he grasped the rein and breasted the
food, and plucked the Lady fi'om her
sinking steed, and laid her safe, albeit
trembling, upon the grassy bank !

Those were happy days for poor Egbert.
But boyhood glided rapidly into youth,

and youth again passed into manhood.
And then, weary of courtship and of suitors,
and, perchance, the more severe with Egbert,
the humblest and faithfulness of all,
he who dared to love but not to woo, —
the severer outwardly with him and with
herself, because, half conscious of some
relenting softness in her inmost heart —
then it was that she earned, by bitter
speech and haughty bearing, the title of
the Proud Lady of Adlersberg.

Curiously ready in handicrafts of divers
sorts, as though the skill he had never
learned were born with him, Egbert was
wont to beguile his lonely evenings (for
the good falconer, his father, and his
mother, the nurse of the proud lady, were
dead and gone), or to employ himself over
the Christmas hearth, whilst old wives
told old stories, and minstrels and troubadour's
chanted their relays, with fashioning
rosaries, and bowls, and coffers, and

such-like toys, to Trhich the craft of the
workman gives their price ; and, amongst
he rest of his trinketry, he had carved
this humble crucifix from a fallen branch
of oak, which he had one day lifted from
his lady's path, and had even dared to
convey it into her bower, wreathed round
with a garland of most rare flowers, some
said, arranged after the manner of the
Turkish Paynim, whereby buds and blossoms
are made to discourse love. Well
did Father Cp'il remember the wrath
which had flashed from the maiden's eyes,
and the angry words in which she had
commanded that Egbert should be chased
from the demesne, and the cabin where
he dwelt razed to the ground ; a warning,
said she (and her lip cuiied as
she spake), to suitors of all degrees,
from the prince to the serf. "Well also
did he remember what was told by the
bower woman, of a pleading voice that

was heard under the windows of her chamber
; and that the Lady Ermengarde had
caused it to be proclaimed throughout the
castle, that if that Voice were again to
disturb her slumbers, the seneschal had it
in command to loose the blood-hounds.
And fi'om that time forth naught more
was said of Egbert. But the lady waxed
prouder to all wooers, and sad and fitful
in hall or bower. And now, behold, when
years had passed, and Egbert with the
raven curls was well nigh forgotten, it
was the scorned relic of his aspiring suit,
the very oaken cross, carved by his hand,
which in that moment of extremity was
found to be worn secretly in the icy bosom
of that cold and haughty beauty ! Brief
space had Father Cyril to marvel at
woman's changeful fantasy. Again the
clash of armour below ! again that fearful
soit, as though the drawbridge were
stealthily lowered, and the portcullis suddenly

raised, and the great gate gently
opened !

'' I will not waken her for yet a moment,"
said the good old man ; and, grasping
his weapon, he sallied forth to inquire
what these <sound>noises</sound> might mean.

Short time was Father Cyril thence.
He won back speedily to the side of the
Lady Ermengarde (still smiling faintly in
her sleep) ; and, made rough and hasty by
the sure knowledge of instant peril, he
seized her chi pale hands, and raised her
suddenly from the chair.

^^ Waken, poor maiden! Waken! Allis
lost ; our last hope is gone."

^^AVliat is this?" responded that sad
lady, scarcely aroused from her pleasant
dreams to the sense of present danger :
" Gertrude ! Oswald ! where be ye ? Eo-isabella
not yet saddled? We ride forth
to-days'' But her words ceased on a
sudden, for she read in the flashing eye,
the quivering lip, and the changed bearing
of the old man, well nigh distraught with
fear and anger, that somewhat terrible
had chanced ; albeit her wildest fantasy
had pictured naught so terrible as his
tidings.

" They have deserted us, vassal and
menial, groom and man-at-arms. The
page that served the cup in the hall ; the
tirewoman that decked thee for the banquet,
all have forsaken us ! I^ay, that
maketh but a portion of their treason.
The defences of this thy place of strength

drawbridge, portcullis, even the iron
gate — have they opened to the enemy,
false traitors that they be, and then withdrawn
their own base persons by the
eastern postern. We two are lost : Alas !
that I should live to see thee in such a
strait, and have no power to aid or rescue.
We two are alone in the castle."

Heady Ermengarde bore a high heart,
and refrained from womanish lamentations,
from shrieks and tears. She clasped the
crucifix to her bosom, no longer caring
whether it were hidden or no.

" May the blessed Virgin look down

upon us !" was all that she said. Then,

after a pause, and in a firmer voice, she

added —

''' Was this treachery, father, or fear?"

^^ A mixture perchance of both, fair
daughter. The seneschal I have mis-doubted
long. He, hoary traitor, hath
sold himself body and soul for vile lucre ;

VOL. ITT. M

and cowardice and base terror seconding
the false knave's persuasions, have corrupted
the rest. Oh that I could meet
that Judas ! old though I be" —

]N'ay, nay, kind father, grasp not thy
sword ! We have more need of thy rosary.
The <sound>noise</sound> thickens about us, clashing of
armour, and trampling of steeds ; <sound>sounds</sound>
such as tell of strife and struggle. Seek
not to drag me hence, Father Cyril. The
courts must be filled with the rude soldiery.
I will rest here and abide my
enemy. Pray for us both, and let not thy
voice falter. Saidst thou that all had forsaken
me ? That of the many who filled
my halls and owned my rule none remained
to defend his poor mistress ?"

"!N'ot so!" replied a voice from the
threshold, as a young man stood there with
a sword ready drawn in his hand. '^ You
have yet left you one defender, Lady of
Adlersberg, beside the good father and the

holy saints ; and thy foes shall bestride
his dead body before a hair of your fair
head shall be touched."

'^ AVhoso spake these words ?" cried the
Lady Ennengarde, greatly troubled, staying
herself against Father Cyril, to hinder
her from falling ; he also, the good father,
was strangely moved ; for the speech
sounded to both like a voice from the grave,
and they perceived that the speaker was
nene other than the falconer's son, Egbert
of the raven locks.

The young man remained on the threshold,
looking away while he spoke.

'remember you not. Lady of Adders
that I warned you that this day
might come ? Eemember you not that I
besought you in the day of your bitter
scorn to take heed how you trampled upon
the true heart that never would betray or
forsake you in sorrow or in peril ? Remember
you not the firebrand that laid

M 2

waste the cottage of your father's ancient
and faithful servant, of your own foster
mother ? They were dead, but not the less
should their dwelling, the dwelling of their
only child, have been sacred to Ennen-
garde of Adlersberg. And those bloodhounds,
remember you not them ? and how
for a Avhole night they tracked as they
might have tracked a murderer or a thief
one whose only crime lay in your beauty ?
And will you not remember, when this
dark hour hath passed, that it was he, the
despised, the trampled on, the outcast, who
returned to share your peril, to die at your
feet ? For, as God is my witness, I look
to leave my corpse upon these stones ; too
happy so to die, loveliest and most beloved
! Forgive me these my ungenerous
reproaches ! Thrice blessed to die for
thee ! "

How fared it now, think you, with the
proud Lady Ermengarde ? Fain would

she have made reply, fain by words or
tears have done honour to such exceeding
constancy and nobleness ; but she could not
speak. She could only point with her finger
to the crucifix upon her bosom.

Well might the youth, Egbert, start to
see his own poor love-token so richly
graced ; but no time Alas this for discourse
or dalliance. The heavy tread of armed
men <sound>echoed</sound> through the castle, sounding
to that poor maiden like her death knell ;
whilst her bold champion bent his gaze on
the stair, up which the soldiery were
crowding, and, standing a little aside, drew
a long <sound>breath</sound> and manfully grasped the
sword in his hand.

'' Speak to him for me, Father Cyril !"
murmured the lady, half dead betwixt
love, shame, and fear. '' W wilt thou let him
die." And she uplifted her voice, so as
to be distinctly heard by him to whom she
spoke.

I entreat thee, kind Egbert, for the
love of Heaven ; I adjure thee by this
blessed cross ; stay not here to peril thy
life for me ! Dost hear me, Egbert ?
Father would I die a thousand fold !'*

But Egbert answered not, unless bending
to kiss that token crucifix as Ermen-
garde held it in her hand, and then grasping
the sword with a firmer clutch, and a
look of high resolve, might be held for
answer.

Nearer and nearer came that heavy
tread — the tread of mail-clad men, mingled
with hoarse <sound>voices</sound> and <sound>clang</sound> of arms ; and
that poor lady already beheld mounting the
stair, host upon host of strange, rough visages,
gleaming fiercely under their glittering
helms. She shrank shuddering from
the sight, and closed her eyes, and tried
to pray, clinging closely to Father Cyril,
who would fain have been safely rid of his
fair burthen, that he might have borne a

manful part in that fearful and most unequal
struggle.

Cheerily the warrior band advanced
toward the gallery chamber, as men who
bring with them a sure welcome ; but, as
the foremost passed the arched portal, the
<sound>ringing</sound> <sound>blow</sound> of a sword was followed by
a low <sound>groan</sound>, and the <sound>clang</sound> of armour, as
one fell dead across the threshold. Then
arose a fierce <sound>cry</sound>.

'' Hew him down ! Cleave him to the
waist ! Whoso caret bar the way of the
Landgrave ? Look up bright lady, you
are rescued ! "

She heareth the voice, that proud lady ;
she lieth to the portal ; she throweth herself
between her champion and his foes ;
she bringeth around his neck ; she caret
for nought but Egbert, as the blood from
a wound in his arm welled forth upon her
white raiment. Little heeded Egbert that
wound; for, saved by the Landgrave's

band from her rude assailants, who saw
themselves enforced to flee in the very instant
of that caitiff seneschal's treachery,
the Lady of Aldersberg cast away her
pride, and amidst tears and blushes, proclaimed
her lover the falconer s son ; bestowed
upon him, that poor Egbert, her
hand and her rich domains ; and caused
the oaken cross, Wreathed round with its
garland of rare flowers, to be carved in
stone on the keystone of every arch in the
great gallery of Aldersberg.

As sure a dog as ever fought at head."

Shakspeare.

They who have had a favourite dog, —
and who has not ? — who have felt the
solace of his mute sympathy in affliction,
and the animation and gaiety which his
gambols throw around our happier hours
will not disdain to participate in the grief
of the humble family of Angus Cameron,
as they gazed upon the faithful creature
who, after lifting up his head and looking
in his master's face for the last time, sank

patiently dowTi, and, whilst poor little
Jeanie flung herself beside him, stroking
his stiffening neck, and mixing her fast
falling tears with the life-blood that dabbled
his shaggy coat, stretched out his
limbs, gave two or three convulsive
twitches, and died. Jeanie would not
believe that Bran was dead ; and even
her grandfather, although contradicting
her assertion that he still lived, with the
irritability of sorrow, deepened by indignation,
raised the body of his favourite, vdih
a half hope that life was not extinct, and
Avhen it fell back a heavy weight upon
the clay floor of their cabin, broke into
bitter denunciations upon the cowardly
tyrant who had slain, in wantonness of
anger and power, the best and bravest dog
that ever trod the braes of Glendorroch.

The peculiar circumstances of the people
and the time lent a double force to the old
clansman's malediction. It was about

twenty years after the Forty-five, in which
unhappy insurrection the chief of that
branch of the Cameronss, together with
many chieftains of that brave and ancient
house had adhered to the last to the
fortunes of Charles Edward, had been
attainted and forfeited, and had died
broken-hearted and in exile, fais only
son, too young at the time of the rebellion
to pah-take of his father's guilt (the old retainer
did not give that name to the part
his leader, GlendoiTOch, took in that remarkable
rising), was deprived of his inheritance,
whilst the large property from
which he derived his territorial title was
bestowed upon a Campbell, the sworn
enemy of the clan, who had intermarried
Tvith a distant kinswoman of the Cameronss.
He, too, was dead, leaving only a daughter,
reared and educated in England ; whilst an
English, or, at the best, a lowland Scot,
elliott of the debateable land, was placed

by the Campbell, her father's kindred, as
agent, looker, factor, (which ever were the
obnoxious word for a most obnoxious office)
over the estates and vassals of the young
heiress.

He it was, a keen sportsman, and a hot
and fiery man, who already deeply unpopular
amongst the clan, with whose language
and manners he was unacquainted,
and whom he at once mistrusted and despised
— he it was, this very Gilbert Elliott,
who had now filled up the measure of his
sins, by shooting Bran. Whilst little
Jeanie was <sound>crying</sound> herself into comparative
<sound>calmness</sound> over the body of the faithful
creature, so long her playmate, Angus
found a relief nearly similar in pouring
forth, in his native Gaelic, the story of his
wrongs, with a fury and energy which
really amounted to eloquence, so deeply
was the old man stung by the mingled
passions of grief and hate.

The story in plain English, and separated
from Angus Cameron's bitter vituperation,
was briefly this :

Elliott, who had, as it appeared, instant
occasion for red deer venison, to celebrate
the coming of age and expected arrival of
the fair heiress, had set forth before sunrise
upon this unlucky morning, attended
by two or three Highland gillies and a
brace of well-trained dogs, with the purpose
of stalking some deer, which had been
seen upon the hills beyond the lake. At
length he reached a station where, concealed
by a tret*, he was enabled to take a
true aim at the noble deer, which he had
been dodging for so many hours ; when,
just as he had raised his rifle to fire at the
quarry, which stood, half suspicious, half
secure, on the brow of a small eminence,
within range of a shot, the baying of a
hound was heard on the other side of the
hill, and in an instant, the stag bounded

away out of sight and hope ; and Bran,
who had unhappily attended his master,
probably for some purpose not far dissimilar,
dashed towards the very spot from
whence his approach had driven the destined
prey. The temptation of immediate
vengeance, not merely upon the poor dog,
but upon his master, for the loss of his
game, proved irresistible. Elliott fired,
and Bran fell ; and the scene of fierce and
angry recrimination which followed ended in
the Lowlander demanding the fire-arms of
which, as he justly said, the law forbade
not merely the use but the possession
among the forfeited clans ; and on the veteran's
indignant refusal to deliver up his
weapon, he gave him notice that he should
send not merely to take away by force all
weapons found in the cottage by the brae ;
but to dislodge the inhabitants, and, if need
were, to pull down the dwelling. " The
Teddy," quoth the man of office, '^ shall

find nae nest of rebels on her land gin fire
and sword can do their work."

The Teddy !" said old Angus to his
daughter, quoting the title with peculiar
bitterness. — " The Teddy, and this to the
foster-father," added he, in the language
of old Gael, in which the remainder of the
dialogue was earned on, " of Claude, the
rightful chief! Ye drew your earliest
nourishment from the same bosom, Kathleen
! were carried in the same arms !
Many a time hath my poor wife owned
that she loved the brave boy — that was
after he was an orphan, Cathleen, — as well
as her own fair girl. Oh, that he were
but here ! There be hearts and arms enow
in GlendoiToch, to teach this Sassenach
looker that the Cameronss will submit to
no woman's rule, least of all when that
woman is a Campbell."

*' You forget, dear father," rejoined
Cathleen, " that the blood of the Cameronss

also flows in the veins of the yoimg heiress.

1 would she were arrived ! She, at least,

is not responsible for the evil deeds of her

kinsmen and guardians, or for the hasty

and violent doings of their Factor. And

if she bear a woman's heart, she will not

see a white haired follower of her mother's

house turned, with his widowed daughter

and her helpless bairn, to couch with the

hill fox and the roe. I would that the

Lady of Glendorroch were here, rather,

far rather, than the brave and gracious

boy — may heaven bless and prosper him !

whom we cannot but call the chief ! Too

much of kindly blood hath been shed in

Glendorroch. We must have no struggle,

dear father ; must not give just cause for

severity to these Sassenach rulers. Hark !

who beats at the door ?"

'the Factor and his folk," replied
Angus, grasping his weapon with a resolute
air.

No ! No ! " was the answer, as she
lifted the latch and admitted a fair haired
young man, who, gazing at her for a moment
with his whole heart in his radiant
smile and joyous eyes, threw his arms
round her waist, exclaiming, " Why ! have
you forgotten your foster brother?"

'' Claude I"

Glendorroch !" cried the father and
daughter involuntarily. All the faithful
clansman's devotion was in one greeting,
as the old man doffed his bonnet to his
chief; all the tender woman's affection in
the other, as she pressed the hand of her
old playfellow.

Cheerfully and cordially were theirs
returned. Claude's look, as he
resumed his old seat by the ingle side, and
looked about, and spake to Angus as if
they had parted yesterday, making acquaintance
with Jeanie, alluding slightly
but feelingly to the loss of her father, and

VOL. in. N

entering into the general grief and indignation
for the death of Bran, the descendant
of a race of dogs who had belonged to
the chieftains of Glendorroch from generation
to generation.

"The Saxon churl!" muttered he; "he
shall abide the deed." And then waiving
off until another time the particular account
of himself and his fortunes which
their affectionate interest required and
deserved, and saying only generally that
he had entered the service of a German
prince, and, after filling the post of aide-de-camp
to a distinguished officer, had
accompanied his old commander on an
important embassy, so that his .prospects
were fair, he returned to the grievance of
the hour, and offered his assistance to
Jeanie, who was by this time seated on his
knee, to dig a grave among the birds and
gowans for her poor favourite.

They sallied forth accordingly. It was

a bright autumn evening. The hills were
purple with heather, whilst the narrow
valley, through which the bright bum ran
wimpling, was green as an emerald, except
where the sun slept with a golden shine
upon patches of velvet turf, and the holly,
and the mountain ash, with their coral
berries crept up the sides of the hills.
Tufts of bluebells waved lightly in the
ail, and the silver bark of the <sound>weeping</sound>
birch glittered through the light and
feathery foliage.

The scene was full of pastoral beauty,
and Claude Cameron surveyed it nth the
feelings of an exile restored to his native
land ; f eelhigs with whose unusual softness
the failings of the tender-hearted little
girl over her dead favourite accorded well.
The young soldier would have respected in
another the tears that certainly stood in
his eyes, if they did not find their way
down his cheeks; nevertheless, he was a

little ashamed of the emotion, and gathered
himself up quickly, when just as he was
replacing the turf over Bran's humble
grave he heard <sound>loud</sound> <sound>sounds</sound> of contest and
distress from the path leading to the
cottage, and was aware of Gilbert Elliott's
myrmidons thrusting forth Angus Cameron,
in spite of the old man's sturdy
resistance, and the alarmed <sound>cries</sound> of his
daughter.

In an instant Claude was at their
side. The weapon withheld with a lion's
strength from the factor's emissaries was
yielded with a child-like docility (such
was the instinct of feudal obedience) to his
chieftain, the real, although unacknowledged,
head of Clan Cameron ; and one
word spoken apart, aided by the chink of
gold in a well punished purse, overcame
the lesser difficulty of persuading Gilbert
Elliott's people to stay any further proceedings
until the arrival of the lady, now.

from intelligence communicated by an
avant courier, confidently expected on the
morrow.

The morrow came, and gathered
together by every means which the indefatigable
Factor could devise, half the
retainers of the house awaited the youthful
heiress before the gates of Glendorroch.
Our friends Angus and Cathleen, accompanied
by little Jeanie, attended in fulfilment
of a promise to Claude, who was nowhere
visible. The old man was dark and
gloomy; and so was all around, in spite of
young girls carrying baskets of flowers,
and children with garlands, and pipers
playing the gathering, and a broken-nosed
cannon firing as often in the half hour as
an engineer marvellously well adapted to
his artillery, being lame of an arm and leg,
could contrive to compass. Every outward
symbol of welcome that mere power could
command was prodigally bestowed. Nothing

was wanting, except that true and
genuine love and loyalty, which no Helen
Campbell, none save the real Chieftain of
old line, could excite in the warm hearts
of their faithful people. The Lady arrived;
as fair a Helen as any since that first and
frailest of the name, who wrought the
woes of Troy. All smiles and blushes the
fair lady came, but few gazed upon her,
for at her side sat a noble-looking man in
the very prime of life, in whom the crowd
recognised at a glance, the youth brought
up in Angus's cottage, the rightful heir of
Glendon'och. All eyes were fixed upon
him, as leaping from the carriage, he half
lifted out his lovely companion, turned her
gently, abashed and shamefaced as she
stood, towards the wondering and expectant
throng, and doing gallantly his
plumed bonnet, said, with a countenance
radiant with happiness, '' Friends and
kinsmen, this is your lady and mine, my
own dear wife, Helen Cameron."

Put out the light— and then."

Shakspeare.

'" A LIGHT upon the cliff above the cottage,
say'st thou, Senor Don Jose ? A
light from the post which I have in charge !
A signal to the smugglers, belike, or the
enemy ? Xow, by St. Ago, great man as
thou thickest thyself, procurator, and
what not, thou may'st rue the day when
thou insulted an old soldier and an old
Castilian I There is some pith and marrow
left in this right arm still'' continued the

veteran, extending as tough and sinewy a
limb as ever grasped a Toledo, " and by
our Lady of Pity, lie who accuses me of
treason is like to feel its weight, were he
twenty times a procurator. If Catalina
had married thee now, as thou wanted
last vintage, or if I had acceded to thy
other proposal, and exchanged my good
olive ground for thy patch of vineyard, we
might never have heard of this matter.
Eut the girl and her father were both of
them wiser. I warn thee once again,
meddle not with an old soldier."

" Nay, good Diego," rejoined the little
lawyer, shrinking instinctively fi-om the
harsh tones and threatening gestures of
him of the Beacon Rock, *^ the saints only
know whether Catalina or I should have
had the worst of that bargain ; and as to
my sunny vineyard, it's worth a dozen of
thy lean liungiy olive grounds any day in
the year. 1 bear thee no malice, however,

Senor Diego," continued the procurator in
the spiteful accent in which a disclaimer
of spite is usually pronounced ; ^^ I bear no
malice, either to thee or to Senora Mercia,
thy wife, and still less to Catalina ; only I
warn thee once more that if the Beacon on
the Cliff be again seen alight without
orders from the Christine chiefs, the warder
will right speedily find himself within the
walls of a prison." And off the little lawyer
walked. After taking two or three
steps, however, he returned. '' Perhaps,
Senor Diego, if you really know nothing
of the matter, — I love to be candid where
I can, — the pretty damsel Lina may have
caused the blaze by way of signal to her
muleteer lover, Gil Gomez'' And now,
having shot off his last arrow, the worthy
attorney walked himself off, with a comfortable
persuasion that he had made his old
acquaintance, and would-wo^-be father-in
law, thoroughly uncomfortable.

Our friend Diego was, as lie had truly
said, an old soldier and an old Castilian,
brought to the frontier by some one of the
many captains who had fought the cause of
the infant queen with more or less ill success,
and placed in a post of real rather
than ostensible trust and importance, as
being one upon whose good faith and intelligence
reliance might be safely placed.

The Beacon Cliff, with which at its only
point of access his cottage communicated,
was a lofty and almost perpendicular rock,
commanding alike the sea-coast and the
mountains, and most useful as a signal
post for the transmission of local intelligence
to the bands in those wild hills and
the ships in the offing. A narrow wooded
drawbridge, beneath which gushed a rapid
stream, led from the gallery which surrounded
Diego's dwelling to the only level
spot upon the Beacon Cliff. From that
landing to the summit, the ascent, as

viewed from below, was apparently impracticable
to any foot less light and
tenacious than that of the goat or the
chamois. But certain slight inequalities,
natural or artificial, winding round the
face of the rock, gave to the bold and
practised climber sufficient footing to gain
the small platform, upon which swung
from a strong iron pole a bucket of the
same material, filled with tar and with
the resinous woods of the country, of
which easily ignited and highly combustible
materials a stock sufficient for many
months' consumption was deposited on the
spot.

A more effectual signal post could
hardly be devised, and, in the disturbed
state of the country, agitated by civil war,
plagued by the bold inland smugglers
called contrabandistas, and exposed to so
much change and anarchy that the English
naval officers, ever the Queen Regent's

best allies, hardly knew whether the district
was possessed by Carlists or christine,
the Beacon, confided as it had been
to bold and faithful hands, had often led
to successful co-operation, and prevented a
useless sacrifice of men and ammunition.

Diego's family consisted of his goodwife,
Mencia, and his pretty daughter,
Catalina, who, as we have just seen, had
made him an effectual enemy, by refusing
the meddling lawyer, Don Jose Ortiz, a
wizen-faced, withered sample of the Spanish
Hidalgo, who (and we suppose the
attorney-phobia is the same in all nations)
had been for years the pest and dread of
the country round, and found his power
rather extended than limited by the present
state of partisan warfare ; inasmuch
as, by keeping fair with both parties, and
denouncing very impartially friend or foe
to whichever happened to be uppermost,
he contrived to increase his importance

and fill his coffers. His accusation lied
completely mystified poor Diego, especially
that part which alluded to Catalina.

'' The Beacon alight last night I Impossible
!'' So rau his half-muttered
thoughts. ^^Poor Liii ! That she does
like that gay muleteer, Gil Gomez, with
his songs and his mandoline, is, I fear,
too true ; and, after all, if he have money
enough to keep the girl comfortably, why
should they not marry some day or other ?
'Tis a light-hearted, good humoured spark,
and she fancies him, as twenty years ago
I fancied her mother. But as to Lina's
lighting the Beacon — with the great key
of the house door under my pillow ; and
at night, too, when I myself can hardly
keep my footing ; and she never up there
except once or twice, when she would goto
help me to carry the fir faggots, and
was forced to turn back before she got
half-way, for very giddiness — Bah I The

thing's impossible ! and, by Santiago, the
Beacon could not be a-light. 'Tis a lie of
that cankered little lawyer, and does not
deserve another thought. I'll just go and
ask Mcncia whether she locked the door of
the balcony last night. Of course she did.
And, that door being locked, how could
Lina get to the drawbridge ? and why
should she light the Beacon ? Bah ! Ita
lie from the first word to the last, and
I'll think no more of it."

Forming internally this wise resolution,
but unable to direct his mind to any other
subject, Diego (for this conversation had
happened in the olive ground on which
Don Jose had cast his eye) strode rapidly
towards his cottage ; as he neared which,
<sound>shrill</sound> <sound>sounds</sound> of female <sound>voices</sound> gave token
of an animated discussion between Senora
Mencia, the wife of his bosom, and certain
neighbours, her gossips and friends. He
arrived in time to hear their dismissal.

" The Beacon alight, good Blancaa ?
and you saw it with your own eyes, you
and Pepita ? You must have been dreaming,
good people ! leo soul could get to
the rock except from the drawbridge that
leads from our balcony, and I locked the
door myself with these hands. You were
dreaming, good gentlefolk ! Pepita there
says she saw Santa Teresa clad in white,
flying over the top of the rock. Santa
Teresa, quotha ! A fair good day to ye,
ladies both ! Santa Teresa, forsooth ! as
if my husband Diego Hernandez, could
not manage his o\YTi Beacon without her
help. Santa Teresa — to be sure, there
was a chapel dedicated to her, but the
Carlists rent that down. Santa Teresa,"
continued Senora Mencia, upon whose
nerves the notion of a saint, clad in white,
flying about so near their' cottage, seemed
to have made an unpleasant impression,
I hope we say as many Aves as our

neighbours. I wonder whether burning
a candle before our Lady of Pity — or to
vow a pilgrimage — I'll ask father Jerome.
Did you see the light of the Beacon last
night, Lina ?" added her mother, as the
voice of the dark eyed beauty was heard
from the cottage, <sound>singing</sound> one of the many
<sound>songs</sound> which Gil Gomez had composed in
her honour. She interrupted herself to
answer Senora Mencia's question, and
then recommenced her song :

"The Beacon last night? !No, dear
mother.

Girls ! for truant hearts a playing,
Vainly vaunted charms arraying,

Flower and veil and fan you ply :
One rare spell your snares is spoiling.
As, o'er steep Sierra toiling

Homeward comes your favourite boy.
'Mid the mules before him creeping,
'Mid his comrades round him sleeping,
Sees he only — Guess and <sound>sigh</sound> !"

*^ Leave that foolish song, Catalina,

and answer me at once. Did you see
Santa Teresa last night flying over our
rock?"

" Santa Teresa flying over our rock,
dear mother !" exclaimed Catalina, in
very natural astonishment. " Santa Teresa
flying over our rock ! Heard ever mortal
such a question ! Santa Teresa !"

" Clad in white," rejoined Mercia.
'^ Pepita and Blancaa vow by all the
saints that they saw her light the Beacon
last night, and then fly away over the
face of the cliff. They talked, too, of
coming to watch again to-night."

"They have been dreaming, mother!
Poor old Pepita passes her life in seeing
visions. Poor old Pepita! She is not
what she used to be, since the loss of her
son. You must have .seen how her poor
white head shakes under her mantilla ;
but she is a kind creature. To be sure
Blancaa ought to have known better. But

VOL. ui.

dreams are catching, dear mother, especially
dreams of the saints ; and you know
my father has always, from motives of prudence,
made a little mystery of this Beacon.
Are you quite sure that he did not light it
last night ? I saw nothing, 1 heard nothing.
But I sleep so sound ; for Gil could
never wake me," sighed she, in a lower voice.
I wish Gil were here again, safe from
these dangerous passes' And then the
<sound>song</sound> was resumed, as she went quietly
about her household work : —

Girls whose lattice late he haunted,
Merry Gil, no more enchanted,

Laughs if frown or smile ye ply.
One thing only tempts iiis glances,
In the churches, markets, dances,

Though a queen herself were by.
One bright star hath fixed him yonder,
To a lovelier, gentler, fonder ;

Must I name it — Lina's eye"*

I am indebted for these characteristic stanzas, with
their pretty castanet snap, to one who excels me in a
great many points of authorship, besides the writing of
national songs, my kind and valued friend, Mr. Henry
Chorley.

This dialogue, which he had overheard
^\'ithout making his appearance either to
the departing guests or the incensed hostess,
did not tend to quiet the keeper of
the Beacon. Catalina's words and manner
had completely assured him that she
had no hand in the matter, and although
a devout son of the Catholic Church,
he was yet a person of too much sense to
put any faith in the St. Teresa version of
the story. He had, however, from the
testimony of the two women, confirming
as it did that of Don Jose, little doubt but
the rock had really been ascended, and the
Beacon lighted ; probably by some daring
Carlist spy, to lead the crews and commanders
of the English vessels upon the
coast into a trap, by inducing them to land
upon some spot only too well prepared for
their reception ; and he determined to walk
to Marquis, a small t:.'',\TL in the neighbourhood,
for the double purpose of hearing



whether any mischief had befallen by sea

or land, and to secure some resolute man

to watch with him the ensuing night. " If

poor Gil were here," thought he, as he

passed through a grove of fine cork trees,

echoing unconsciously his daughter's

dearest wish ; '^ or, failing him, Lope

Mureno ; he is strong, agile, and resolute.

Aye ! Til secure Lope Mureno ; and we'll

conceal ourselves among the pine faggots

on the platform, or keep guard below,

according to circumstances."

« « « «

Twelve hours had passed since the conversation
between Jose and Diego in the
olive-ground. It was now midnight, and
dark from the want of moon, but clear and
cloudless. *^ This is a strange story that
Ked Miles has told us ; and still stranger
is that which we have gathered from these
women," said Captain Heywood to his
first lieutenant, Mr. Deane, as they

were pacing the sands beneath the
rocks, trying to keep as much as possible
in the shadow, but yet where they might
see every movement both in the cottage
and about the Beacon Cliff. Pepita and
Blancaa were also watching, and approaching
at some little distance appeared a lightfooted
young man. picturesque in figure
and air, with a mandoline in his hand,
which he now and then struck, and <sound>humming</sound>,
apparently from the mere impulse
of a gay and buoyant temperament, brief
snatches of many airs.

However, we are not alone in our
folly, if folly it be," continued the English
officer, for there are the votaries of St.
Teresa; and the young man tripping
towards us on the other side seems, by the
description, to be the muleteer, the lover
Gil — what is his name ? Gil Gomez. If
there be, as Diego suspects — and he has
been so constantly faithful and watchful

that I rely implicitly upon his word — If
there bo treachery we shall be strong
enough to seize the traitor — provided
always, that he he simple enough to come
again. Ha ! the muleteer was expected.
There is a light in Catalina's chamber — is
it not what was described to us as Catalina's
chamber ? Aye ! there she is, opening
the lattice, and we shall after all play no
more important part than that of witnesses
to a serenade. 'No, by heaven, she is the
culprit after all. Look how she is forcing
herself through that barred and narrow
casement. And the lamp ! she will set
herself on fire. No ! she is through. She
is letting down the di-abridge. Do you
see her, Deane ? It is too heavy for her
strength ! It will fall back upon her.
Had we not better call ? 'No ! She has
passed it, and is climbing the rock."

'^ She is asleep, Senor !" cried the Muleteer,
who by this time had joined them.

Holy Mother, protect her! Look how
boldly she treads, as if unconscious of
danger."

Yes, it is a case of somnambulism.
There can be no doubt of it," replied Captain
Heywood, in Spanish. " Nothing
can be so lucky as our coming, since it
frees Diego from all suspicion. But how
to save her! She pauses now, and if
awakened might return without much
danger. Shall we call ? But what is
become of the lover ? Aye, I see now, he
is rousing the mother and getting upon
the balcony."

And more quickly than any, except a
lover, could have reached the rock, Gil had
won to a place where, if his fair mistress
had fallen, he was close behind to save her,
and then, after a gay and lively symphony
upon the mandoline which he had still retained,
he began in a clear, manly voice

the air which she had herself sung that
very evening : —

*' Girls ! for truant hearts a-playing,
Vainly vaunted charms arraying."

And before he had finished the first
couplet the fair sleeper awakened and fell,
with a little start, trembling into the
lover's arms.

I thought that all things had been savage here."

Shakspeare.

Few families were more chivalrously attached
to the person and principles of the
unfortunate Charles the First than the
ancient and wealthy house of Coningsby of
Simonburn ; and yet such was the jar and
conflict of opinion in those stormy days,
that the leaven democracy and puritanism
made itself manifest at an early period of
his reign in a younger son of that royal
and flourishing race.

Ealpli Coningsby, the cadet in question,
was a grave and thoughtful youth, who,
being intended by Sir Walter to pursue
his fortunes at the bar, under the auspices
of one of the corrupt and subservient
judges of the time, threw up his profession
in disgust at the oppressions of the Star
Chamber and the levity of his fellow
Templar ; and returned with all speed to
Simonbiirn, where his departure from the
family tenets in politics and religion
occasioned, to the jolly old knight his
father, and the gay gallants his brothers,
much such a shock of painful and ashamed
surprise as might have been produced by
the discovery of some dreadful crime.

Alienated from his relations and connections,
he was naturally thrown amongst
the professors of his own stricter and
sterner faith ; many of whom, little anticipating
the tremendous convulsion which
was about to shake the kingly power to

its very foundation, were turning their
eyes towards that fair Xew World, that
distant and interminable wilderness, which
the voyages of Raleigh had opened to
their view ; and where their wildest visions
of religious freedom and republican equality
might be realized.

Ealph Coningsby's desire to join one of
these bands of pilgrims met with a ready
assent from Sir Walter, who willingly
advanced, even at the expense of a grove
of oaks at the back of the hall, the moderate
sum required for the outfit and the
voyage ; so much did he rejoice at the
prospect of ridding himself of one whose
austerity of morals and of manners was
silently felt as a reproach by the whole
household, even whilst proclaiming him
the opprobrium of his race. To get rid
of the first strict professor that ever bore
the name of Coningsby, the sacrifice of
the grove of oaks seemed nothing. Father

than see that rigid and sanctimonious
young face glooming twice in every day
over the wild fowl and the wine flask in
the great hall, Sir "Walter would have cut
down every tree in the park.

Moderately, therefore, but sufficiently
provided, Ealph Coningsby set sail from
the port of Hull for few England. But
although unaccompanied by any of his
kindred, the young adventurer had a companion
on his voyage, whose society would
have been enough to reconcile him to a
less voluntary exile.

Alice Eavenshaw was the orphan daughter
of a former Vicar of Simonburn. She
was an early playmate of Ealph's, reared
in the same tenets, and, separated by
death from all natural ties, readily consented
to become his wife, and to share
his fortunes in that distant land. A
young girl, who had been her personal
attendant, went with them also, from pure

affection and fidelity ; and perhaps no
three persons ever left their native country
with less regret.

A tedious, but on the whole a prosperous
Yojage brought them to Xaumkeak
(afterwards called Salem), on the eastern
shores of Massachusetts; and Alice and
her attendant Lucy were speedily settled
in a log hut in the middle of a small
clearing, which Ealph, with such assistance
from the other pilgrims as kindness
offered, or money could buy, applied himself
assiduously to bring into cultivation.

Their husbandry prospered. Ealph,
young and active, and used to the manly
exercises of the time, foimd health and
content in his labours ; whilst Alice and
Lucy, accustomed to the rude and hardy
mode of living which was in those days
the lot of all except the very highest
ranks (in thinking of the hardships of the
Pilgrim Fathers we are a little too apt to

forget the march of civilization, and that
the comforts now found in every cottage
were then hardly to be commanded in the
palace) — Alice and her faithful handmaiden,
habituated at home to '^ winter
and rough weather," would have been
without a grievance of which to complain,
had not they naturally cherished an undefined
but ungovernable fear of their neighbours
of the woods, the true lords of the
soil, the fierce and warlike Eed Indians.

Even this feeling, however, was destined
to undergo a change. One day,
shortly after she had become a mother,
Mrs. Coningsby had advanced farther than
usual into the woods, tempted by the
freshness of a close and narrow valley, in
the bottom of which was a clear dark
pool surrounded by magnificent trees,
whose foliage exhibited all the tender
beauty of tint peculiar to that month
which the Indians call the moon of

flowers. She had wandered far, and was
thinking of returning to her home and
her infant, when her ear was caught by
the low <sound>wailing</sound> of a babe, and following
the <sound>sound</sound> she saw a Squaw seated on the
ground, her back supported by a large
white oak, and an infant clinging to her
bosom, whilst a Warrior stood leaning
upon his bow, in an attitude of dejection,
and with an expression of painful suffering
which those ^^ Stoics of the Woods ''
seldom allow themselves to exhibit. On
approaching them nearer she saw that the
Squaw was dead, and that the wailing
child was vainly pressing its little fingers
against her breast, for the nourishment
which it could no longer afford.

The <sound>cry</sound> of nature is alike in all languages.
It went straight to the young
Englishwoman's heart. She snatched the
famished infant from the lap of its dead
mother, and regardless of colour or race,

placed it to her own bosom, <sound>wept</sound> over it
as it inhaled the nutriment which it so
inch wanted, and contrived to make the
grateful chief understand that his little
son should share her cares and her love
with her own boy. And for above two
years Exorbitant (such was the name of
the Narragansett chief, one of the most
powerful of his tribe) left the child in her
hands. At the end of that period, just
when he had begun to lisp the name of
mother, a dead deer was one morning
found at the door of their cabin, and the
Indian boy was gone.

Time rolled on. Divisions upon points
of doctrine and church discipline had
arisen among the religious community of
Salem, as ^Naumkeak was now called ; and
they who had sailed three thousand miles
to escape the intolerance of the dominant
establishment in the old country, became
themselves intolerant of the opinions of

their neighbours. Alas, and these are the
wise !

Ealph Coningsby had mingled deeply
and bitterly in these differences ; and
partly from that cause, partly from an
adventurous love of life in the wilderness,
he and his now large family retired
deeper into the woods, and were settled at
an extensive clearing remote from other
habitations.

One evening the father, his two elder
sons, and their male domestics, had gone
to some distance to seek for their strayed
cattle ; and their trusty damsel, Lucy,
was standing at the door listening to the
mournful note of the Whip-poore Will,
whilst the mother and her younger children
were pursuing their customary avocations
in the house. Suddenly Lucy
rushed in, and seized a carbine, whilst an
arrow, falling at Mrs. Coningsby's feet,
explained too clearly the motive of her

VOL. in. p

strange action, and told the startled household
that the Periods, the most treacherous
and dangerous of the Indian tribes,
were upon them. In another second, before
the faithful handmaiden, bold from
the very desperation of fear, could fire the
carbine which she had seized, they heard
the terrible war-whoop, and gave themselves
up for lost. Another minute
passed; the frightened inmates of the
dwelling, expecting the instant entrance
of their merciless foes, almost dreading, so
numerous did they seem, that the return
of Mr. Coningsby and his sons would but
add fresh victims to those whose doom
seemed already sealed; when they were
aware of another and more powerful band
of warriors advancing from an opposite
point, and a yet <sound>shriller</sound> war-whoop, at
the <sound>sound</sound> of which the cowardly Periods
fled, whilst the friendly IN'arragansetts
formed a guard around the house; and

their young leader, approaching j\Ii's. Coningsby
as she advanced to give him entrance,
bent to kiss her garment, and
whispered in the broken but well-remembered
accents of infancy, " Mother ! dear
Mother!"

p 2

Murder, most foul, as in the best it is —
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural."

Shakspeare.

The tract of land which joins Hampshire
to Berkshire is surprisingly wild and
rude, considering that it is situated in what
maybe called the immediate neighbourhood
of the metropolis — that is to say, within
twenty leagues, and in the very midst of
the best cultivated and most populous district
of the South of England. It consists
of a chain of hills, or, perhaps, more accurate

ely speaking, of a belt of high tableland,
so high that the Romans, those dear
lovers of a commanding position in every
sense of the word, had erected a series of
military posts along the line ; embracing
the two picturesque and precipitous stations
called Caesar's Camp and the Beacon,
and the city of Winchester, whose deep fosse,
now a verdant meadow, — whose rock-like
wall, crowned with old trees, and twined
together with ivy, — and whose graduated
amphitheatre, remain almost entire ; whilst
the tesselated pavement of the baths is
now and then exposed by the plough, and
the course of the streets may still be traced
by the stunted growth of the springing or
ripening corn — forming altogether one of
the most perfect and curious Eoman remains
in the kingdom.

In this tract there were few inhabitants
of the higher order. Divided amongst
three or four large and distant landed

proprietors, the old manor-houses that
still remained standing, had degenerated
from their pristine rank and beauty into
the dwellings of yeomen of the second
class ; while even these farms were, from
the prevalence of common land, remote
and unfrequent; and the livings were,
from the same cause, so small that two or
three of them Averse mere appendages to
richer benefices, and served by curates
from the nearest town; so that that blessing
of a rural district, the resident country
clergyman — a blessing even in his secular
capacity, as the friend of the poor, their
comforter in distress, and their counsellor
in perplexity, — the educated and intelligent
man, known to them all, and to
whom every one may resort, with the certainty
of commanding his disinterested
advice, and his zealous services, — even
this important functionary was wanting
at Alloy.

As the farmers were few and scattered
so were the agricultural population, which
may be said to depend upon them. The
very shops were so far apart, that if the
inhabitants had been more numerous, there
would have been danger of a famine ; and
before the Xew Beer Act, there was not
an alehouse in the parish. Poaching had
always flemished, in no common measure,
at A]lonby; but now that a beer-shop,
snugly ensconced beneath the very comer
of the coppice, offered the delinquents a
convenient rendezvous, the Act authorizing
the sale of game facilitated the disposal
of the spoil, the severe and angry
keeper found his hares and pheasants disappear
with tenfold rapidity.

This keeper, Michael Parr by name,
was one of the most important personages
of the neighbourhood. Besides the liberal
salary and comfortable residence which
lie derived from his situation, his late wife

had been a widow of some little property
for her station, and the two young
daughters, by her first husband, who were
left under his care and guardianship (he
had no child himself), had each so many
hundreds as would render them excellent
matches for young men in their own rank
of life. The younger, Anne Earth, was
indeed still a child ; but her sister Lucy, a
girl of nineteen, was one whose charm of
person and manner, her sweetness and
gaiety, and a certain natural gentility and
grace, rendered her, in addition to her
little portion, an object of great attraction
to the beaux of the village.

lucy's gentil lesse had all the advantage
of contrast ; for, although gamekeepers
be generally, in consequence probably
of their frequent intercourse with
their masters, amongst the best mannered
of gentlemen's servants, Michael Parr was
a notable exception to the rule ; being

about the roughest and suiiiest peasant in
the whole county of Southampton ; <sound>loud</sound>,
rude, overbearing, and obstinate. How
his stepdaughter, reared under his roof,
and with little benefit from female training,
(for her mother had been dead for many-years),
came by her smiling gentleness,
might be a puzzle, if we did not every day
see living instances of such associations,
the modest violet springing up from the
roots of the gnarled oak, aud the woodbine
intertwisting its flowery garlands with
the dark and prickly leaves of the holly.
It seems a law of nature that the sweet
and gracious should mingle with the stem
and the frowning, without either losing
one particle of its distinguishing quality.
That Lucy would not have been happier
with a step-father of milder mood, I do
not pretend to say ; but she had the rare
and precious secret of making the best
of her situation, even under circumstances

of more than usual trial to a young
and soft-hearted girl.

'' Never fret, Annie," said she one day,
in reply to certain murmuring and pitying
of the affectionate and quick-tempered
child, '^ never fret about me ; times will
mend. Perhaps my father may at last
forget this old grudge between him and
Master Prescott ; for he cannot really believe,
whatever he may say, that either he,
my Lord's head woodman, or his son, are
concerned in this poaching, which worries
him so ; perhaps Master Prescott and he
may make up matters ; or perhaps he may
learn to distinguish between William and
his father. I am sure nobody can be more
respectful to him than poor William is ;
he treats him as if he were my Lord himself;
or, at all events, Annie, even if that
shake of the head of yours say true, and
there is no chance of his relenting, why
eighteen months will soon pass away

and then" — and T\'itli a bliisli and a smile
of exquisite brightness Lucy turned away
her fair face from her young sister and suddenly
stopped, as suddenly as if William
Prescott himself had been there to hear
her.

'^ Eighteen months and then I and
what then, sister?" inquired Annie,
<sound>laughing</sound>.

\rhj then, you know, I shall be one
and twenty ; of age, as it is called."

Well, but will that make Master Pan
open his front door to let in William
Prescott ?"

Xo !" rejoined Lucy ; " but if William
should continue in the same mind, there
will be nothing to hinder me from walking
out of the front door to my aunt at Belford
— and then — you know, Annie, that
by our poor mother's will, if, when I am
one-and-twenty I should happen to — to
marry, and have a home for you, you may

come if you like and live with me. Would
you come, Annie ? Would you like to
live with William and me ?''

Would I, my own dear Lucy ! Would
I not ?" and instantly they were clasped
in each other's arms, with the affection that
so well became the near and dear relationship
by which the young orphans were
united.

This conversation took place as they
were arranging the light and pretty cottage
kitchen, bright and radiant with the
mingled effects of cleanliness and order,
after their noontide meal. The repast
itself had been embittered to Lucy, and
still more to her loving little sister, by the
violence and threats of Michael Parr, who
had passed the whole of dinner-time in
speaking ill of William and his father.
Then with the happy buoyancy of youth
came these peaceful and happy anticipations,
— anticipations never destined to be
realized !

The two old men had unluckily met the
night before at the sign of the Horse
Shoes, a place which, although neither
was a drunkard, both parties visited much
too frequently ; and the keeper, whose
naturally surly temper was stimulated
into tenfold fierceness by beer, haying
more than insinuated his suspicions that
the woodcutter was art and part in the
disappearance of his hares and pheasants,
an accusation which, aided, in his own
case, by mine host of the Horse Shoes'
good liquor, caused his adversary's wrath
to blaze forth so wildly that it was as
much as the landlord and the rest of his
company, consisting of the parish clerk,
the blacksmith, and the shoemaker, could
do to prevent the defiance which each had
hurled at the other from ending in a personal
conflict ; whilst William, who came
in accidentally, had caused a diversion of
the pugnacious keeper's fury by calmly

assuring him that some day or other he
would repent his present conduct. Nothing
is so provoking to a man in a passion, asa
cool prediction of this sort from one
whose temper is unruffled ; and this threat,
as he called it, had not only thrown
Michael Parr into fresh fury at the
moment, but had rankled in his mind to
that very hour ; the last words that he
spoke on leaving home implying his fixed
resolution to detect the Prescott, if, as he
firmly believed, they were the poachers,
and to bring it home to them if it should
cost him his life.

And this was the declaration that had
awakened Annie's sympathy, and alarmed
her for the fate of her sister's love affair,
in which, like most yoimg girls led by
circumstances into such confidences, she
took a warm and anxious interest.

With a view to relieve the expression
of gloomy thought which clouded Lucy s

countenance, Annie exclaimed, " Let us
go to the Holm Coppice, Lucy, after ere
have called upon dear Aunt Benham. I
have not gathered one primrose this year,
and I do so love to find the very first.
Besides," quoth the little maiden, in a half
whisper, ^Hhey are felling the elms, and
William will be there. Let us go to the
Holm Coppice."

A momentary smile played round Lucy's
rosy mouth ; love and joy were in every
dimple. But a moment's reflection changed
the glad expression of her lovely face,
although its sweetness was indestructible ;
she shook her head, and paused for an instant
at the wicket, which she was opening.
"Xo, Annie! you forget that my
father will be there also, setting, as he declared,
some trap, not for the game, but
for the poachers. And even if he were
not in that coppice, we ought not to go
there. It is not maidenly, dearest Annie,

to go without cause to the place where
," and with a bhish, quick and unconscious,
which brought back the smiles and
the dimples, a blush which rose to her very
temples, she suddenly paused. *' The time
will come, mine own Annie, when you
will understand these feelings. We must
not go to the coppice ! But we may,
perhaps, meet with some primroses on the
southern side of the Mount. I should like
you to find your favourite flower to-day,
Annie ; we'll walk over the Mount."

!Now this Mount, as the country people
call it, is the very perfect remains of the
old Eoman amphitheatre.

The level space in the middle, a direct
and most equal oval, with its open entrances
for wild beasts at each end, and the
graduated seats for the spectators, rising
rank over rank, each distinctly traceable,
although overgrown with ivy and trailing
plants, and mixed with huge trees, the

growth of centuries, in which, the rooks
have formed a large and <sound>noisy</sound> colony ;
this amphitheatre, so perfect and yet so
changed, the oval space in the middle
being all that is now clear of wood, and
which is quite as level as a lawn, had
been always one of the sisters' favourite
haunts.

Passing, therefore, the rock-like walls,
crowned with pollard oaks, and tufted with
immense bushes of ivy, maple trees, and
hoary thorns, with the dark and mirror-like
pool, which reflects so finely the tall
elms upon the margin, the white speckled
clouds, and the clear blue sky, they reached
the amphitheatre, and found, in a southern
nook, among the roots of an old beech, a
tuft of primroses, in all the variety of
blossom, fi'om the full expanded flower,

hands and <sound>laughed</sound>, insensible to the
dignity which a maiden almost in her teens
ought to have displayed, — close to the
primrose pale," she had the delight of
finding a half-blown violet, ^^ dim, but
sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes, or
Cytherea's <sound>breath</sound>," at which treasure little
Annie fairly jumped and <sound>shouted</sound> with
ecstacy ; and then after gathering her wild
nosegay, together with other stray blossoms
which she had found scattered in that
sheltered nook, she and Lucy proceeded to
the widow Benham's cottage, which stood
beside the Mount, snugly protected from
the chill north-east ; and doubled the pleasure
which the flowers had already given
her, by presenting them to her venerable
friend, and arranging them in a small cup
of delicate old china, — a relique of better
days, of which the white ground was
almost as transparent as an egg-shell,
while the raised flowers might vie in delicacy

of colouring and arrangement even
with these, the first beauties of the spring.
Mrs. Benham took the freedom of age and
affection to speak of William Prescott, and
lament the squabble at the Horse Shoes,
and especially the threat of vengeance of
which she had heard : " And yet he is a
^e youth, Lucy, and a good son has he
been to the dead and the living, to her
who is gone and to him who remains ; and
the good son \\dll make the good husband.
If my brother Michael could but be reconciled
— but we must wait and hope : yeare
full young yet, and may have many
happy years in store. A blessing will go
with you, Lucy, if only for your kindness
to a lone widow who has none to care for
her now save your gentle heart, my precious
child." And the tears fell from the
good dame's eyes, whilst answering drops
mingled with the smiles and blushes on
Lucy's blooming cheeks.

Q 2

It was now sunset, for the primrose
quest, and the daily cares rendered by both
the girls to the sick widow, had caused the
time to pass by unheeded. Eut it became
every moment more and more probable
that the keeper, always irritable and impatient,
might return home for his tea, and
Lucy, laying aside her scruples respecting
William, agreed to return by the shortest
path; in the present case, certainly not
the quickest ; for the woodcutter, whether
attracted by the light and graceful figure
as the two young maidens crossed the style
leading into the coppice — or whether he
was really leaving work, so that the meeting
was purely accidental — did yet join
the fair sisters just as they were passing
rapidly on their way ; and the five minutes
hurried talk, which ensued, albeit full of
fear and consciousness, a brief and stolen
interview, was yet inexpressibly soothing
and comfortable to both.

" Your step-fathers (William, who never
used ill-words towards anybody, proved
his distaste towards Michael Parr by the
constant addition of that ominous monosyllable
; never had he been known to say
your father), ^^ your step-father, Lucy, will
repent his unkindness towards us both before
long. Of that I am certain. He
shall repent it. Will you go, Lucy? Can't
you stay a little longer ? Five minutes ?
One ? This is meeting only to part. Well
then, if go you must, good night, my
Lucy ! Good night, Annie ! If you won't
let me return with you, I must run back
to fetch my axe which I have left in the
copse, Annie I One word, Annie ! A
secret ! A great secret ! Lucy must not
hear — come nearer : Now listen ! Do contrive
to call upon Mrs. Benham just about
this time tomorrow, and to come back this
way. Manage that for me, Annie. Goodnight,
dear Lucy !" said the lover, disappearing
over the style.

Annie, charmed to find herself of importance,
and making a great mystery of
William's whisper, tripped back in the
gayest spirits ; and such is the buoyancy
of youth and so contagious the hilarity of
a young and innocent girl, that, unpromising
as their prospects appeared, Lucy herself
was happy and hopeful in no ordinary
measure. Little cause had they for the
haste which they had made to gain their
home before the return of the cross-grained
keeper.

They waited tea (the meal which in
that sort of life is, perhaps, especially
amongst women, that which they like the
best), they kept the tea-kettle on their
cleanly-swept hearth, until an hour so
fashionable that it would not have been
credited in Alloy ; and when at last
they took their own simple meal, they deposited
the keeper's nicely-made toast,
together with the tea-pot, in the chimney
corner, to keep it warm for him in case of

his returning shivering with cold and
fatigue from a night watch of the coverts ;
for with these poor girls, Lucy especially,
duty was almost as wakeful and careful as
love. Midnight came and passed, and
still no signs of Michael Parr.

As the night wore on, the placid cheerfulness
with, which, the betrothed maiden
had been blest yielded nati-ally enough
to anxiety and depression. The rain had
long been <sound>pattering</sound> on the eaves ; a cold
wind <sound>moaned</sound> among the tall trees, whose
huge branches <sound>creaked</sound> in the rising
tempests like the mast of some mighty
ship ; and the dogs, the keeper's especial
charge, <sound>howled</sound> in a manner which even
they who are most accustomed to these
sagacious animals cannot, under certain
circumstances, help feeling to be ominous,
however difficult it might be to convey
the impression to any who had not heard
that most dismal of living <sound>sounds</sound>.

'' Hark ! '' interrupted Annie ; *^ I hear
<sound>steps</sound>, they are coming. Can that be
Chloe's bark ? How wild and strange !
Don't open the door yet, sister. It can't
be them?"

And wild and strange was the short,
quick intermitted bark, which, <sound>sharp</sound>,
piercing, and painful even to agony, rose
above the redoubled <sound>chorus</sound> of <sound>howling</sound>
from the kennel above the <sound>blasts</sound> of the
tempest, and above the steps and <sound>voices</sound>
of many men, who were now distinctly
heard approaching the cottage. They
paused in the court, afraid it may be to
convey to the innocent girls the shock
which their dreadful burthen could not fail
to impart ; but Chloe had no such scruple :
she, continuing her wild <sound>shrill</sound> <sound>cry</sound>, flung
herself against the door, scratching at it
with her slender paws, as if she would
have beaten it in; and, when Lucy's
trembling hands undid the latch, rushed

wildly towards the hearth, pausing for a
moment in front of her master's high-backed
oaken chair, and then, returning
restlessly to the group in the court,
leapt up as if endeavouring to reach some
object in the background.

The sight of Chloe had prepared the
sisters in some degree for what was to
follow. The poor dog's silky coat was
dabbled in blood, not her own ; and when
Thomas Leigh, the under-keeper, tried,
and strong rough man as he was, tried
in vain, to announce the dreadful news to
Lucy, she at once relieved and surprised
him by inquiring in a low voice, "Is he
dead?"

Dead Michael Parr had been for some
hours. The body when found was stiff
and cold. Marks there were of a severe,
though probably a brief struggle, the
ground being considerably trodden about,
and one or two hazel branches broken

and torn down. But upon the whole the
death had been quick and sudden; a
ghastly wound in the head, by some sharp
and weighty instrument, having extinguished
life at a <sound>blow</sound>. Beyond this all
was mystery. The under-keeper, Thomas
Leigh, whose cottage was placed at a considerable
distance to watch other coverts
upon this extensive tract of woodland
manors, had been roused, just as he was
retiring to rest, by the same <sound>sharp</sound> <sound>shrill</sound>
<sound>cry</sound> of distress, I may say of anguish, from
poor Chloe, accompanied by beatings apparently
much too violent for her strength
against the door of his dwelling. Upon
his answering her summons, she instantly
seized his coat ; and being well acquainted
with her sagacity, and her strong affection
for her master, he and his brother had
followed her to the Fifty Acre Coppice,
and there, — " I mean the coppice where
the woodcutters are at work," added

Thomas in explanation, ^^ there vre found
the body ;" — what he woukl have said
farther was interrupted by Lucy's falling
down in a fainting fit, from which she was
with great difficulty recovered— recovered
only to hear of fresh horrors.

Judicial enquiry soon led to the development
of some circumstances which were
suspicious only to professional acumen.
Tracks and foot-marks had been discovered,
which suddenly disappeared at the Woodcutter's
cottage. The elder Prescott had
been engaged during the previous day and
still remained at some distant woods,
selecting and marking, under the direction
of an eminent surveyor, the oak timber
to be included in this year's fall. He was
out of the question. William, besides the
worn and harassed appearance of a man
who had passed the night in tremendous
crime or overwhelming misery, presented
the strange mixture of reserve and recklessness

so often observed in great
criminals. Circumstance upon circumstance
combined to fix the guilt upon him
and upon him only. The remarkable
tipped shoes, whose marks had been traced
from the corpse to the cottage, which the
village shoemaker and his neighbour the
blacksmith, both identified as ordered by
himself were actually found upon his feet ; a
jacket, with stains, which, although partially
washed out still bore traces of what the surgeon,
calledtoexamine the body, recognised
as the ineffectually removed marks of blood ;
this jacket, still wet and known by twenty
persons as William Prescott's usual dress,
was thrown carelessly in a comer ; and underneath
it lay, equally well known, the axe
whiche was accustomed to use inhis labour,
and which, besides corresponding exactly
with the wound on the head, which had
proved Michael Parr's death-blow, retained
ghastly evidence of the deed. — " The gray

hairs yet stack to the heft !" From the
moment that the police officer held up
the axe, mute but eloquent accomplice of
this awful deed, the doubt and pity which
had before accompanied the search
throughout the cottage, disappeared before
the natural horror which such a crime
awakened. The accused took no means
to revive or awaken more favourable
feelings. He sank upon the settle beside
the hearth, whose untended embers had
been long extinguished, in shivering
<sound>silence</sound> ; and when handcuffed to one of
the constables, and roughly commanded to
follow, he seemed rather to obey the mechanical
impulse of the man to whom he
was linked, than to apprehend the meaning
of the words.

Some amongst the villagers had observed
the previous quarrel, as well as the parting
of the lovers, and, more dead than alive,
Lucy obeyed a summons to the inquest in

trembling <sound>silence</sound> ; and, deaf from excess of
nervous irritation, tried vainly to hear and
to comprehend the mild and soothing
address of the official functionary. Looking
up for that purpose, she caught sight
of William. The expression of his countenance,
his attitude, and the irons with
which he was loaded, told her at a glance
the dreadful truth. She listened to no
questions, she waited for no pause, but,
shrieking with fearful rapidity, ^^ He is
innocent ! He is innocent ! Beware how
ye, too, commit murder !" she fell upon
the floor in strong hysterics. From that
hour many weeks of fever and delirium
passed away, before she was restored to
the agonizing consciousness that a verdict
of wilful murder had been returned against
"William Prescott.

This tragedy occurred just after the Lent
Assizes had been holden at the county
town, so that the prisoner had the advantage

of a considerable space of time in
which to seek such testimony as might
counterbalance the strong chain of circumstantial
evidence upon which the verdict
of the inquest had been founded. And
after the immediate and fierce indignation
had subsided, the usual reaction had taken
place ; many began to balance the virtues
of a life against the suspicions of an hour ;
and offers were conveyed to the jail of whatever
money might be needed to trace the
real criminal. Calmly and thankfully
were they declined. Without confessing
the crime, William Prescott seemed resolved
to abide the punishment. Even
from one, the dearest, he had refused such
proffers — refused even to admit her to his
cell.

^^ It is strange, Annie'' said she, as
they were walking together on a balmy
May evening, when the sun, almost
level with the horizon, shone upon

a row of <sound>weeping</sound> birches that crowned a
bank covered with gorse and broom —
the light, magical in its effect, tinting
the silver bam and golden tassels of the
lady of the woods with a fairy lustre,
that more than realized Turner's daintiest
fancies — '^ it is passing strange that William
seems to take as much pains to prevent
his friends establishing his innocence
as another might do to prevent the proof
of guilt. Why, if it were, indeed, the
poachers whom our good aunt Benham
suspects — why for them should he throw
his life away ? since, if he still persists in
this <sound>silence</sound>, the lawyers say that nothing
can save him. Well," continued she, in
the same calm and resigned tone in which
she had hitherto spoken, " I shall not survive
him long ! Do not cry so, dear Annie.
In that certainty is my only comfort."

"Is ay, dearest sister," began Annie,
when she was interrupted by a <sound>rustling</sound>

on the other side of the bank, accompanied
by a renewal of that fearful <sound>barking</sound>,
never heard save on that fearful night,
from Chloe, the murdered keeper's favourite
dog.

A miserable man, lean, pallid unwashed,
unshaven, ragged, starved, crawled forth,
scarcely resisting the attacks of Chloe,
whose furious assaults were restrained with
difficulty by the trembling girls, and dragging
himself to the feet of Lucy, demanded,
in a tone of agony, '^ As you would save a
sinful soul, tell me the truth, and the whole
truth — if the murderer be not found, must
William die ?'

** As surely as I stand here," was the
reply.

'^ Take me to the good ^dcar, drag me
before the magistrates, let all the country
hear me — bring them hither before I die"
and he fell back, as if already his last
hour were come.

VOL III. B

^^ This is what I have believed in my
inmost heart," said Lucy, " ever since I
have known that "William's father had
disappeared Oh, Master Prescott T' said
she, as the old man, upon whose pallid
face Annie had sprinkled cold water from
a bright spring by the way-side, was once
more reviving — '^ oh, Master Prescott,
clear, if you can, your innocent son! I
always knew that he was innocent !"

The old man spoke with effort and
difficulty : — " We met that night in the
coppice. I had gone there to ascertain
the girth of one particular tree. He
seized me, pretending to take me for a
poacher ; Mocked me doAvn, spurned me,
being down ; and, when I rose, maddened
by his insults, the axe was in my hand,
and in my frenzy, I struck at him as if I
had been felling an oak ; — then came my
noble boy — she dragged me away, and
made me promise not to surrender myself.

Oh, Miss Lucy, bring witnesses, bring
officers to carry me to prison ! Think, if
I should die without clearing my boy !"

And that night the miserable father did
die ; but not until before competent authorities,
he had established the innocence of
his son.

Who would give a bird the lie ?"

Shakspeare.

I DO not know whether in the list of
organs which figure upon the skill-maps
in the system of Doctors Gall and Spnrz-
hei, there be any which, being translated,
(for of a verity the language of phrenology
needs translation) would indicate a fondness
for animals. Most assuredly, if no
such propensity be therein marked, it is
an important omission, and should be
supplied forthwith ; for that such an

inclination does exist most strongly in
numberless individuals of both sexes, and
is often developed under the most extraordinary
disadvantages, is as certain and
far more frequent than the prodigies in
music and painting, in languages and in
calculation, the Mozart, the Correggio,
the admirable Crichton, and American
boys, those wonders of learning, of science,
and of art, whose lives crowd our biographical
dictionaries, and whose heads (as
handed down in books and portraits) form
the triumph of the phrenologist.

Separate from the fondness for animals
generally, and more distinctive and
engrossing perhaps than any other species
of that very engrossing propensity, is the
passion for birds. Boys are liable to it asa
class ; and so they say is that particular
order of single women ungallantly termed
old maids. It prevails a good deal incertain
callings, chiefly among sedentary

artisans, such as tailors, shoemakers, and
hairdresser in provincial towns. A barber
in Belford Regis is amongst the most
eminent fanciers of the profession, and
wins all the prizes at canary-shows for
twenty miles round.

Also the taste is apt to run in families,
descending from father to son through
many generations. Ours, for instance,
happens to be so distinguished. My
grandfather had an extensive aviary, and
was a celebrated breeder of the whole
tribe of song-birds ; and his brother, my
grand-uncle, is even now remembered as
the first importer of the nightingale into
Northumberland. He had two in cages
which he kept for several years, to the
unspeakable delight of the neighbourhood,
who used to crowd around his hospitable
door to listen to their matchless note —
one of the few celebrated things in the
world which thoroughly deserves its
reputation.

My dear father was no degenerate
descendant of his bird-loving progenitors.
How well I remember bis telling me under
what circumstances be first went to the
play. When a little boy at a preparatory
school at Hexham, a strolling company
visited the town ; and being about to getup
"The Padlock," (recommended, I
suppose, by the fewness of the characters,)
and in great distress for a bullfinch, a
property essential to Leonora's song, —

Say little foolish fluttering thing,
Whither, ah whither would you wing
Your airy flight ?"

the manager, having heard that he possessed
a tame bullfinch, came to him to
request the loan ; which he granted with
characteristic good humour, and received
in return from the grateful manager a free
admittance for the season. Fancy the
pride and delight of the boy in seeing
his favourite figuring upon the stage, and

hearing the <sound>applause</sound> of the audience as he
perched upon the prima donna's finger!
This must have been considerably above
eighty years ago ; and (for in this respect,
as well as in his general kindness, " the
boy was father to the man") the fancy
remained all his life in full force and
constant exercise. There is scarcely any
sort of bird that comes within the compass
of moderate means which he has not
possessed at one period or another. Once
during the twenty years that we lived ina
large country-house, with its spacious
lawn, its extensive paddock, and noble
piece of water, he assembled a great
quantity of domestic game, if such a
phrase be admissible; pretty speckled
partridges — too pretty to be eaten ; pheasants
of all varieties, from the splendid
English bird to its eastern rivals, the gold
and the silver ; and a large assortment of
water-fowl, from the queenly swan down

to the trim little Dutch teal. Xing Charles
himself never had a more extensive collection,
or took greater delight in tending
and cherishing his feathered subjects.
But these half-civilized savages proved
attractive to two orders of miscreants, —
poachers pursued them by day and thieves
by night ; and dead or alive, shot or stolen,
the domesticated partridges and tame wild
ducks gradually disappeared. To them
succeeded all manner of curious poultry.
Peacocks, pied and white, together with
that commoner but most gorgeous bird,
who flaunts his starry train over the grass,
and whose graceful vanity so becomes his
stately beauty, adorned our farm-yard;
accompanied by ]Muscovy ducks, Poland
fowls, Friesland hens, crested bantams,
and so forth. Then followed pigeons of
all denominations. Fantails, pouters,
carriers, nuns, and dragons, crowded our
dovecote. But somehow or other our ill

luck continued. The poultry had a trick
of dying, and the pigeons flew away ; so
that my father resolved to confine himself
to the aviary, and took to breeding canaries,
and had the honour of carrying away
the prize for three birds of the three
orthodox kinds, jonque, pied, and mealy,
from nearly two hundred competitors.

Long, too long, would it be to tell of all
the smaller songsters, the larks, linnets,
thrushes, and blackbirds ; the bullfinches,
goldfinches, and '' all the finches of the
grove ;" as well as of the owls, hawks,
crows, and ravens, the birds of day and
the birds of night, which have at different
times occupied his attention. Suffice it
to say, that fifteen years last August, our
feathered family consisted of two nightingales,
one of which had been in our
possession for sixteen months, singing all
day (for in a cage the nightingale only
sings during daylight), with matchless

strength and power, from the first of
October to the last of June ; a piping
bullfinch, a linnet, two starlings, and the
magpie whose adventures and accomplishments
form the subject of this true
history.

Amongst our infinite variety of feathered
bipeds, the class, which in default of
a better name, I shall take leave to denominate
talking-birds, had been upon the
whole the most distinguished. Even I,
who, partly, on account of the tragical
termination of many of our pets, partly
because I so dearly love freedom and the
greenwood, that all the hemp-seed and
groundsel in the world would never, I am
sure, reconcile me to a cage, did not so
heartily sympathise in this taste of my dear
father's as I did in most of his other pursuits
— even I, albeit no bird fancier, could
not help being occasionally diverted by
the saucy chattering jays, starlings, and

jackdaws, which it was the especial delight
of that saucy, chattering, diverting, personage,
Master Ben, our factotum (groom,
gardener, page, and jester), to bring about
the place.

Pre-eminent over all other talking-birds,
and unrivalled since the days of Yet-vert,
was the magpie in question. He, for a
wonder, was not of Ben's importing.
Whence he came nobody knew, although
the old flycatcher, who was also the parish
sexton, and whom he followed for a
whole hour in the twilight as he was setting
his traps to catch an underground
enemy that infested my pansy-beds, alternately
shouting to him by his name of
Peter Tompkins, in one ear, and imitating
the <sound>tolling</sound> of a bell in the other, insinuated
to me, with a look of great horror, "that
the fewer the questions asked upon that
subject the better; the creature certainly
was no better than he should be. Nobody

could tell for whom that bell would toll
next." And off shuffled poor Peter, fancying
himself a doomed man.

For certain, Mag's first appearance had
been somewhat in character with the good
sexton's suspicions. He had hopped
down the walk and stopped opposite the
glass-door of our garden-room, where we
were sitting with several friends, and one
amongst them happened to inquire the
hour. " "What's o'clock ?" reiterated Mag,
in a soft, slow, distinct voice; " Half-past
four." And upon consulting watches, and
that very true time-teller, the sun, as he
threw his beams upon the old dial, half-past
four it was ; and everybody stared at
the bird, as he stood upon one leg, with
his head a little on one side, looking very
knowing and exceedingly ragged and dirty,
as your tame magpie is apt to do. Everybody
stared at the bird, and <sound>laughed</sound>, and
said that it was a strange coincidence, as
everybody does say, upon such occasions.

Mag's further proceedings were in keeping
with his oracular entree. A saucy
bii'd he was, and a mischievous, <sound>singing</sound>,
<sound>whistling</sound>, <sound>sneezing</sound>, <sound>coughing</sound>, <sound>blowing</sound> his
nose, <sound>laughing</sound>, <sound>crying</sound>, <sound>knocking</sound> at doors,
<sound>ringing</sound> at bells, thieving, and hiding with
singular dexterity. He caught up and
repeated with remarkable facility all that
was said, and really seemed as if he understood
its purport. For instance, I one
day said to him, '' Mag, if you bite my
finger, I will never give you any more
fruit or sugar." And although I regularly
did feed him every day with sugar and
fruit, mine were the only fingers in the
house that remained unbeaten. He certainly,
too, could apply names to their
right owners. One of his great delights
was to summon all the servants about him ;
sometimes in his own soft distinct tone —
sometimes by imitating with a wonderful
cleverness, my voice, or his master's.

^^Ben! John! Martha! Lucy! Marianne!
And, when he had got them all around

him, *^ Go," he would say, '^ Go to ;"

and when everybody was expecting something
as naughty as Yet-vert would have
said, after his voyage in the coche d'eau
had contaminated his manners, he would
suddenly break into a <sound>laugh</sound>, and finish his
sentence with "Go to Jerusalem ! Go to
Jerusalem !" He never failed to call over
this beadroll of names at least once a-day,
and if the wrong person answered, Lucy
for Marianne, or Martha for Lucy, he
would stamp his little foot and scold, and
storm, and refuse to be pacified, until the
offender begged pardon and asked him to
begin his catalogue again. Sometimes he
added the dogs to the list, and the greyhounds
— a simple, credulous, innocent
race — readily answered to his call. Once,
and but once, he took in my lamented
Flush, a beautiful little brown cocking spaniel,

a greater pet even than himself, and
infinitely more sagacious. " Flush !" said
Mag, with an imitation of my voice that
was even startling ; and Flush, who was
looking forward to our evening walk, threw
down his hone and ran to answer the summons.
^^ Flush !" repeated Mag, in the
same tone, with a nod and a <sound>laugh</sound> ! In
my life I never saw such a mixture of
shame and anger as my beautiful pet's large
bright eyes exhibited. Mag tried the
trick again. But it failed. The perfect
good faith of the gentle and faithful little
creature, who, never deceiving, could not
suspect deceit, had enabled the knavish
bird to cheat him once ; but the imposition,
once detected, became, so far as Flush was
concerned, altogether powerless.

Nevertheless there was no resisting a certain
degree of liking for the poor bird, whose
tricks of drollery — for every day he came
out with something fresh — really seemed

inexhaustible. He had a cage, to which,
being generally fed there, he frequently
retired of his own free will. One day,
however, he was missing ; that tongue of
his was a thing to be missed, just as the
near neighbours of a mill or church -
steeple would soon feel the absence of the
<sound>clapper</sound> and the <sound>chimes</sound>. He had left the
premises more than once before, and had
led Ben and John a dance amongst all the
trees and cottages of Aberleigh — appearing
and disappearing — now on the ground
and now on the house-top, playing at bo-peep
among the roofs and chimneys in a
manner more provoking than words can
tell ; so that Ben, after fairly lodging his
new straw hat on the branches of a pear-tree,
from the topmost bough of which
Mag, swinging much at his ease, had
thought fit to hail him with his usual
*^ How d' ye do. Master Ben?" had fairly
given up the chase in despairs



Once, twice, thrice, had Mag eloped;
but then the tricksy spirit had never failed
to make itself audible ; and even when,
upon one occasion, he had absented himself
for one entire night, he had taken
care to re-appear in the morning at Ben's
bed-room window with his usual tap,* tap,
against the glass, and the grave businesslike
summons — ^^ Past six o'clock, Ben !
Time to get up !" wherewith he was wont,
as regularly as the clock <sound>struck</sound>, to awaken
that trusty domestic.

Only the Tuesday before, Mag had been
absent for a longer period than common ;
but, directed by a singular <sound>noise</sound> of fierce
and angry jabbering, something like the
scolding of a woman in a passion, he had
been discovered in a field at the bottom of
the garden, engaged in a furious disputation
with two wild birds of his own species
earnestly defending a bare and dirty bone,
his own property doubtless, fi'om the incursions

of these intruders. That Made had
fought with other weapons than his tongue,
and been worsted — that he was very glad
when our approach frightened away his
opponents — was quite plain ; but they
being gone, he gladly followed us home in
the opposite direction, and had, up to this
unfortunate Friday (for it was upon this day
of ill luck that we missed our poor bird),
conducted himself with a degree of prudence
and discretion that showed him to
have taken warning by his contest and
discomfiture.

On that Friday, however, he was missing
from noon to night; the next morning
dawned — six o'clock <sound>struck</sound> — but no magpie
tapped at the window to call Ben; he
was neither in the house or the garden, on
the trees or the chimneys. That the poor
bird was lost seemed indisputable ; and so
strong was the general impression of his
attachment to us, and of his sagacity, that

we were pretty generally convinced that
he must have been stolen. Who might
be the thief was not so easy to determine.
Aberleigh is situated upon a well-frequented
road leading from one great town
to another, and our cottage stood in the
centre of the village street. Moreover,
holding a sort of middle station between
the gently, to whom we belonged by birth,
and habits, and old associations, and the
country-people, almost our equals in fortune,
who all resorted to my dear father
for advice and assistance in their little difficulties,
there was scarcely a person within
ten miles who did not occasionally pay a
visit to our habitation. Then Ben's acquaintance
! gardeners, gamekeepers, cricketers,
grooms ! Ben knew the whole
country. And although it would be rather
too affronting to suspect one's friends
and acquaintances of thievery, yet they
amongst whom the magpie was deservedly

popular had of course contributed to diffuse
its reputation.

On that unlucky Friday, too, we had
had even more visitors, than common.
Two or three sets of people had come fi'om
London by Railway; five or six neighbouring
families had called ; the coursing-season
was coming on, and tw(j or three
brace of greyhounds had been bought by
their respective owners to be compared with
our dogs; a flower-show was approaching,
and half-a-dozen gardeners had been backward
and forward amongst zinnias and
dahlias ; a cricket-match was pending, and
the greater part of the two elevens had
come to arrange the day and the hour;
one constable had arrived for orders to
send ois an encampment of gipsies who had
established themselves in Woodcock lane,
and another had come for a warrant to
take up a party of vagrants caught in the
fact of poaching, and suspected of sheep-stealing

at Ilinton-Do^Aai. Who was the
thief was still a mystery ! But when day
after day passed over, and no tidings
arrived of our bird, that he was stolen
became the firm conviction of our whole
family.

Sorry, however, as we were for the
merry, saucy, little creature, whose spirit
of enjoyment and activity of intellect
seemed so disproportioned to his diminutive
form and his low rank in the scale of living
beings, still the recollection began to wear
array; and when at the expiration of a
week, we sallied forth to pah-take of a
dejeuner in the beautiful grounds of
Aberleigh Great House, our domestic
calamity was, to say the truth, pretty
nearly forgotten.

Never was a more delightful little party
than assembled by the side of the clear
brimming Loddon, on a glorious afternoon
near the end of August. The day was so

sultry that the tables were laid under
some magnificent elms upon the lawn,
forming nth its adjuncts of picturesque
architecture, of exquisite scenery, of lovely-young
women and thrice lovely children,
a picture of gay and courtly elegance
worthy of Watteau.

The dejeuner, however, sumptuous and
luxurious as it was, formed by no means
the chief attraction of the day. Under the
long lofty terrace, crowned with old firs
and lime-trees, which forms the boundary
of Aberleigh Park, the Loddon, spreading
for nearly a mile into an almost lake like
expanse, rivals the Thames in consequence,
whilst it far surpasses it in beauty; and
then, narrowing as it is spanned by the
low arches of the bridge, glides along
amongst <sound>quiet</sound> water-meadows with a pastoral
seclusion and tranquillity which would
have enchanted Izaak Walton. A row up
this bright river was the express intention

of the party; and, accordingly, the grand
question of oars or sculls being decided,
water baled out, rowlocks and <sound>howls</sound> examined,
we set forth in three as pretty
skiffs as may be seen between Battersea
and Putney Bridge; ourselves as men
and happy a set of people as are often
assembled in this work-a-day world.

Some were sailors — one especially, most
worthy of that honoured name, which is
the synonym of all that is frank and kind
and true-hearted in man; and one, who by
some mistake in destiny is not really a
sailor, but who possesses all the attributes
and almost the skill — some were sailors,
some were soldiers, some .gentlemen at
large : but the charm of the party was felt
to be the freight of one of the boats, consisting
of four lovely young women <sound>singing</sound>
like nightingales, and, as it seemed, from
the same impulse of a full and joyous
heart, who went backward and forward

upon the water, spreading abroad melody,
as the sun diffuses light or the roses their
perfume. That craft was naturally looked
to as the one fi-om which we should derive
most pleasure, but we hardly on embarking
anticipated the kind of amusement
which it was destined to afford.

It so happened that one of their' rowers
was accidentally detained, and another
compelled to take the management of the
boat containing the children, so that our
pretty congresses fell to the charge of
one solitary boatman, who, taking care
that no real harm should befal them,
seemed to find some diversion in plunging
them and himself into small difficulties ;
and, the rudder being unshipped, they, so
to say, staggered about upon the water as
if the boat were tipsy ; now running
aground upon an island, now taking a
snag (to borrow a phrase cmTent upon
the Mississippi) ; now caught (by veil and
bonnet) in the bushes upon one bank,

now entangled in the sedges upon the
other, until the syrens of the Loddon,
half frightened and half-amused, mixed
<sound>screams</sound> and squalls with the sweet <sound>strains</sound>
of the Canadian boat-<sound>song</sound>, and <sound>shrieks</sound> of
<sound>laughter</sound> with *^ A boat, a boat unto the
ferry."

After shooting the bridge matters grew
worse. They had sailed from harbour so
loni^ before our boat, that we had hitherto
only looked and <sound>laughed</sound> at the strange
tacks, voluntary and iu voluntary, which
their skiff had taken. But now gallantly
manned and ably steered, we shot ahead
of them, drowning " Testator del 'onde"
by such a torrent of river wit as shall not
be exceeded from Gravesend to Kew.

At last, when, amid <sound>laughing</sound> and
<sound>singing</sound>, and <sound>quiet</sound> enjoyment, the mists
were rising in the meadows, and the
moon looking down into that bright
miiTor the still smooth stream, we
took our fair damsels in tow, and prepared

to return homeward. Looking upas
we were about to shoot the centre
arch of the bridge, I saw a strange vaga-
baptising gipsy sort of light cart, that
looked as if it had never paid any duty,
passing above it ! and while our mermaids
were <sound>singing</sound> with a delightful unity of
their young <sound>voices</sound>,

Oft in the stilly night,

Ere slumber's chain has '

"bound me," they would have added, but
that charm was broken by a well-known
voice from above, which pronounced with
startling distinctness, '^ Go, go, go, to
Jerusalem !"

Was it my magpie, or was it his
wi'aith ?

Of course, by night, a good mile fi-oui
our landing-place, and then a mile back
again to the bridge, all search or enquiry
was hopeless. I told the story when I got
home, and found the whole village divided

in opinion. Some thought with me that
the gipsies lead hold of him ; some with
my father that he had been stolen by the
more regular thieves ; some thought that
it was a trick; some that it was a mistake;
aud some held with Peter Tompkins that
the magpie was no magpie after all, but an
incarnation of the Evil One in black and
white plumage.

Again was poor Mag forgotten, as one
bright September morning we set forth
towards Farnham, a pretty old-fashioned
town overlooked by the bishop's palace,
with its stately trees and extensive park,
and famous for its hop-gardens, and for
Mr. Garth's geraniums, where in one small
greenhouse he rivals in splendour, although
not in extent, Mr. Foster's exquisite collection,
and equals him in hospitality and kindness.
It is something remarkable, I think,
something pleasant as well as remarkable,
and peculiar to our age and country, that
two English gentlemen should surpass, by

the mere effect of taste and skill, the efforts
of the working gardeners, whose livelihood
depends upon their flowers, with the strong
stimulus of desire of gain on the one hand,
and the enormous resources of wealth as
lavished in the greenhouses of our great
noblemen on the other. To raise a magnificent
geranium is to increase and multiply
beauty, and to strengthen and diffuse the
feeling of the beautiful in this work-a-day
world. Ai-t herself does little more.

The road from Aberleigh to Farnham
passes through very pretty and very interesting
scenery. We leave Stratified
and Winchester, emblems of the present
and the past, to the right ; and Sir John
Cope's magnificent old mansion of Branchial,
and the parsonage at Heckfield, Adhere
Mrs. Trollope passed her early days, to
the left. Then we pass through a succession
of wild woodland country to the little
town of Odium ; plunging again into

forest-like glades, until we cross a high,
barren, heathy ridge called the Hogs
Back, the view from the top of which
forms a superb and extensive panorama.
Descending this long, steep, and lofty hill,
we find ourselves once more amidst cultivation
; quaint old-fashioned villages sunk
deep in the valley, and patches of hop-gardens
intersecting the fields. The hop-gatherers
were busy in taking down and
stripping the long poles, the English
vintage ; and the lines hung like garlands
in rich TVTeaths of leaves and flowers intertwined
one with another, and diffusing
around the bitter racy aroma of the fragrant
plant, dear to the lovers of mighty ale. A
pretty scene it was and a stirring. We
stopped the carriage at the gate to view it
more closely, and listen to the gay jests
and merriment of the many groups collected
in the ground. There is something
contagious in real hearty mirth, and Ben,

our driver, without knowing why, joined
in the <sound>laugh</sound>. Apparently his peculiar
<sound>laughter</sound> was recognised ; for in a moment
we heard from the other side of the gate,
'' Ben ! how d' ye do, Ben ? Glad to see
you, Master Ben ! Go to Jerusalem!" in
Mag's most triumphant tones ; and this
time we did not hear in vain. AVe recovered
our bird ; and long we possessed
him, happiest, sauciest, and most sagacious
of magpies.

*' Thy greyhounds are as swift as breathed stags."

Shakespeare.

Nothing can be more striking than the
\yild and uncultivated aspect of the country,
the scanty sprinkling of towns and villages,
and the primitive manners and appearance
of the scattered inhabitants, Which may
occasionally be found within some fifty
miles of the crowded sophisticated metropolis,
and almost within ken of that mighty

engine of civilization — that mighty annihilate
of time and space — a railroad. How
long this happy state of things — for to
those who delight in rural sights and
sounds, and dread the day when London
and its suburbs shall quite stretch fi'om seato
sea, a happy day it is — how long this
pleasant anomaly may continue, I am not
rash enough to prophesy; but at this
present writing, with the clock on the
stroke of twelve, and the chilly, windy,
frosty, nineteenth of January stealing into
a twentieth, chillier, winder, and frontier
still, at this finger-nipping, cold catching,
beginning of the year of grace 185 — , I
could point out half a dozen tracts of heath
and woodland, as free from the contamination
of city smoke, or city finery, as
the mountains of Wales or the Highlands
of Scotland.

The spot, however, with which we are
more immediately concerned is a district

VOL III. T

of Oxfordshire, divided from the gay and
populous county of Berks, and the busy,
thriving town of Belford Regis, by one of
the most beautiful boundaries in her Majesty's
dominions, the broad translucent
Thames. jS^o sooner have we passed the
long straggling bridge, and left the river
and its pretty village behind, than the
roads become narrow and rugged, the
banks shelving and broken, the hills abrupt
and precipitous ; the groves and woods
by the way side expand into shaggy heaths,
sinking into rude dells, and backed by
antique forests, and the whole scenery assumes
the wild and sylvan character of an
old English chase. In early summer,
when these commons, dotted by clumps of
holly and hawthorn, and dimpled with
glittering pools, are bordered by their
deep beech woods, shining in the tender
green of their young leaves — the irregular
belt varied here and there by some huge

cherry tree starting from the verdant mass,
and covered with myriads of snowy blossoms
— the ground beneath carpeted with
wild flowers, from the rarest orchis to the
commonest daisy — it is a pleasure of pleasures
to dally in those fragrant paths, and
penetrate to the utmost depth of those
moss-grown recesses ; nor is the scene
less beautiful in the still clearness of an
October noon, when the first frost has
given a golden tinge to the foliage of the
beech, whilst the cherry trees have assumed
that indescribable richness of colouring,
which seems as if the fast falling
leaves had been dyed in the rosy juice of
the fruit. The boasted brightness of the
American fall can scarcely exceed the
vivid hues of the Oxfordshire 'cherry
country," after the earliest frosts of an
English autumn.

It is not, however, the lover of nature

only who delights in this wild district.

T 2

The sportsman, baffled by the garden-like
cultivation and lawny enclosures of
this swarming Berkshire of ours — whose
villas and villages, and village greens,
some irreverent fox-hunter was once
pleased to designate by the name of Clapham
Common — luxuriates in the distant
coverts of turfy hills to the north of the
great river. Dear above all to the courser
was that wild and open country, becoming
wilder and more open with every mile ;
the absence of hedgerows enchanted his
eye, and the bleak wind, as, having surmounted
the Wanton Edges, he looked
fairly across the valley to Hatherton Hill,
never failed to gladden his heart : Atherton
Hill being next perhaps to Compton
Bottom the best place for trying a greyhound
in England; the very !Newmarket
of coursers.

Into wonder that the finding themselves
on the road to this place of delight, some

twenty years ago, should exhilarate the
spirits of two young country lads, who,
driving a spirited horse in a light open
carriage, and having charge of two or
three brace of dogs belonging to a master
who had gone an hour or two before to enjoy
a few days' coursing with an intimate
friend, conceived themselves amongst the
happiest and most important of all human
beings. The happiness was pretty equally
shared ; the importance by no means so ;
one of the pair, by name Master Ben, being
the real groom, valet, man of all work,
factotum, and what not, to whom was delegated
the charge of carnage, horse, and
dog, — whilst his comrade, who boasted the
euphonious appellation of Tom, was only a
deputy's deputy, hired for the nonce;
moreover, Ben was eighteen, and thought
himself a man — a mistake into which Tom,
younger by two years, and shorter by two
inches, could hardly fall ; Ben had a new

jacket, Tom an old one ; Ben had half-a-sovereign
in his pocket, Tom half-a-crown ;
Een was a courser, and had been at Hatherton,
whilst Tom had not only never
visited that classic ground of all sportsmen,
but had actually never seen a greyhound
run in his life.

To do Ben justice, he did all he could to
enlighten Tom's ignorance, at which he
thought himself much scandalised, though
whether, like many a greater man, he
might not find some consolation in so fair
an opportunity of laying down the law upon
the subject without risk of question, maybe
doubted ; at all events, whatever could
be done by talking of coursing, from the
traditions of the late Lord Rivers's kennel,
the some time monarch of that princely
sport, to descriptions of Mr. Godlike's,
his successor in skill, in spirit, and in success,
Ben performed con amove; and between
eulogium upon all the principal

dogs, with historical accounts of their different
matches, and biographies of their
several trainers, mixed with certain prophecies
respecting the success of ^^ their
own stud" — to follow literally the grandiose
phrase of the lecturer — especially a
yellow bitch called Marigold. In talk like
this, diversified with occasional digressions
respecting the good cheer of the house to
which they were bound, and a few hints
respecting a black-eyed dairy-maid, who
seemed to rival Marigold in Ben's regard,
the time sped pleasantly along.

Ben had talking to keep him warm, and
Tom had novelty and anticipation, and the
indomitable spirit of enjoyment of a country
boy upon his first journey, sitting in a
gentleman's carriage, and behind a gentleman's
horse: less happily engrossed they
might have been to find that the December's
night was closing in raw and cold, and
that when, after climbing up a steep ascent.

they again got into the phaeton, the wind,
which met them on the top, blew so fiercely
as to render walking, if the less dignified,
by very far the pleasantness mode of progress.
Matters were not mended when
the shelving craggy banks, picturesquely
clothed with wood, which had hitherto
skirted the road, disappeared, and they
found themselves on a wide open common,
of a very irregular surface, with the young
moon just showing her slender face in a
dreary-looking piece of water at some distance,
and no shelter of any sort visible, sofar
as they could see. The mind blew
colder and colder ; the very dogs, instead
of keeping, as they had hitherto done, at
the side of the carriage, seemed shrinking
behind.

'^ Marigold P^ cried Ben. ^^Mf/rtle ! Maf/-
fljj! Manhood! Whew! Marigold then.
Whew — ew — ew I ! !" And Ben uttered
the <sound>shrill</sound> prolonged <sound>whistle</sound>, peculiar and

individual as an autograph, with which he
had been wont to summon his favourite.

"Whew — ew — ew! ! !" resounded from
the bottom of the hill.

Ben was no coward, and the days of
ghosts are over (besides, who ever heard
of a ghost whistling), nevertheless, he was
a little startled ; and when Tom, professing
to believe it an echo, drily desired him
to try it again — an injunction Which he
mechanically obeyed — the whistle had, so
to say, a shake, which, if it could have
been executed at will, would have had
considerable value in a musical point of
view. It's a great pity that mere letterpress
can give no idea of the sound ; but,
although we must fail in the delineation,
yet a most exact copy did arise this time
from midway up the hill, continuing at intervals,
mixed with slight variations, until
at length a small figure, with the whole
pack of missing dogs scampering around

him, appeared at the top of the ascent;
and Tom (for the hero of the <sound>whistle</sound> had
stopped the horse from more motives probably
than he could easily have enumerated)
exclaimed, in a tone between
amazement and disappointment, —

"Why, it's only little David, after all ! "
Only David ! '' rejoined Ben, giving
vent to another half <sound>whistle</sound>, checked pretty
hastily, as the effect of the last glanced
over his recollection; '^ David ! why it really
is that little rascal, and the wretched
pigmy of an animal that Marigold is tossing
over and over can be nothing but his dog
Spider, I knew that he was dying to
come, but to see him here, twenty miles
fi'om home, with eight good miles before us
before we get to a house, and he all in
rags and without a farthing in his pocket —
poor tatterdemallion ! — to pay for a bed ora
supper when we do get to Hatherton ;
hang it, Tom, there's spunk in the little

creatures is not there ? Suppose we take
him on with us, eh? Master likes his
pluck, and he'll be useful to help hold the
dogs. Here, you sir ! jump up here, can't
you -; how came you to bring that dwarfish
cur of yours with you ? do you think weare
going to course rats and mice, or to
run against spaniels and teniers ? or, for
the matter of that, how came you here
yourself ? Get in, I say; jump !''

And with a sly <sound>whistle</sound>, ostensibly addressed
to the greyhounds in general, and
to Spick?' and Marigold in particular, but
into which, in spite of his gratitude for
Een's condescension, he could not resist
the temptation of infusing some slight
reminiscence of the above-mentioned shake,
little David did jump into the phaeton; and,
animated by their past adventure, (nothing
is pleasant than a brief puzzle, with the
least dash in the world of a flight, when
once it is happily over,) the three drove on
in tenfold glee.

Little David, dwarf and tatterdemallion
as Ben had justly called him, was a well-known,
and, to say the truth, a popular
inhabitant of our good village of Aberleigh.
The poor boy was an orphan, and how old
he was, who were his parents, or to whom,
they being dead, he might be said to
belong, were questions which nobody gave
themselves the trouble to ask. Whether
he had such a superfluity as a surname,
was doubtful. I question whether he
knew it himself, or whether it had ever
occurred to him to make the enquiry.
" Little David," was distinction enough
for him. All that was known of his history
was, that he had been placed by some
long-past overseer with an old parish nurse,
and that when the vestry claimed him as a
denizen of the workhouse. Dame Butler,
a lonely and childless woman, had become
so strongly attached to the friendless boy
that she refused to part with him, and in
spite of the remonstrances of the parish

authorities, and the still more urgent
pinching of poverty and age, had contrived
to support him until he could earn
his own living. Wonderfully soon did
that happen. David vindicated the affection
of his protectress by his industry
and good conduct. When other children
are hardly trusted to take care of their own
limbs, he began to be useful in their little
menage; and whilst the other brats of the
village were thinking of nothing but getting
into mischief and out of scrapes, he
was already watching sheep, driving pigs,
and keeping birds from the corn for the
farmers; milking cows, feeding poultry, and
chuiTiing butter for their wives ; helping,
now in the wheelwright's shop, now in the
ropeyard, now at the forge; tending the
curate's flowers, holding the vicar's horse,
and running errands for everybody. Xever
was so trusty or so alert an assistant !
never, since the time of Puek^ (and really

David was not much bigger than the popular
notion of that esprit fillets was so
vivacious or so diligent a little messenger.
^No opportunity of turning a penny in an
honest way came amiss to him; and by the
time he was as high, to use Ben's mode of
mensuration, as Marigold shoulder, at
which time he might by a rough computation
be about eleven years old, he had
fairly repaid Dame Butler's kindness by
earning nearly enough, not merely for his
own subsistence, but for hers.

Of all his ways of winning money, however,
that in which David most delighted
was the hard work called sporting — which,
to that half of the world which calls itself
the wiser sex, has a fascination so universal,
that it must in them, as in the nobler
races of animals who minister to the passion,
be inborn and intuitive. When still
in feminine habiliments, and little bigger
than a full-grown infant, it occuiTcd to

David, then exerting himself as aide-de-camp
to a tall scarecrow in frightening the
birds fi'oni a field of wheat, to see in a
water furrow a hare on her form. The
field was by the roadside ; Een, already-known
to the urchin by sight and name,
happened to pass ; the boy pointed to the
hare : Ben galloped ofi" to fetch his master
and the dogs ; a fine run was the consequence;
and the love of the sport never
from that hour flagged or dwindled in
David's bosom. As soon as he was old
enough to keep up with the party, he was
employed to lead the dogs, to help the
spaniels in beating hedges, to find hares
sitting — LQ short, to form one of the busy,
joyous train, called a coursing party; and he
soon became as well acquainted with the
greyhounds, and nearly as good a judge of
their various merits, as Ben himself.

By accident he had even become possessed
of a greyhound in his own person.

One evening in the spring preceding the
date of our story, a poor, scared, half-starved
creature, apparently only two or
three months old, was driven by some idle
boys into a small court in front of Dame
Butler's cottage. David, tender-hearted
to all animals, rated the children, and
called the frightened, trembling puppy, ina
tone which, with the remarkable instinct
by which dogs at once recognize their
friends, the poor little thing immediately
obeyed. The remains of a basket were
about her neck ; she had evidently escaped
from some coach or railway, and wandered
about probably for days. After having
satisfied his conscience by making inquiries
at Belford, David, attached to his
foundling — the first living thing he had
ever called his own — from the sense of
benefit conferred and the poor creature's
fond gratitude, prevailed with some difficulty
on his good old grumbling nurse to

receive Spider (by which exceedingly plebeian
name he chose to designate her) as
an inmate.

Never were dog and master better proportioned
to each other. Spider was far
more like an Italian than an English greyhound,
and, dwarfed probably by her early
misadventure, did really seem fitter, as
Ben said, to purse 'rats and mice, and
such small deer," than to run after a fuU-
gro^Ti hare ; and, as to permitting him to
try her speed against Marigold a presumptuous
wish which David had been rash
enough to hint at, the thing was too derogatory
to be thought of. It would be like
matching a Shetland pony against a racehorse.


It was not even without many rebukes

for bringing such a lap-dog, and many
injunctions to remember that he must
make everybody understand that Spider
did not belong to '"' our stud," that Ben

VOL III. u

suffered David to bring his lap-dog (the
most injurious name that he could think
of) along with them. He even snubbed
Tom for venturing to assert that she would
be pretty if she were rather bigger. To
all which contumelies little David, who
had received many kindnesses from Ben,
to say nothing of the present cast, made
no worse answer than a whistle.

Brightly shone the son on Hatherton
Hill, when, on the second morning after
their journey, horse, and dog, and man,
properly rested and refreshed, sallied forth
for a long day's diversion. It was a gay
and gallant sight : the hospitable host,
surrounded by his own line family, his
troops of friends, and train of grooms and
keepers, upon that magnificent eminence,
forming a panorama, for extent and for
historical interest, such as shall hardly
be pardoned in the south of England.
And the sport was worthy of the scene.

Never were such hares ; never were such
dogs ! Marigold beat Nestor ; and Ben
was beside himself. And little David,
who had never before seen coursing upon
the Downs, David was crazy ! It seemed
incredible that so much noise — for to the
honour of coursing be it said, there is no
noisier pastime — could come from so small
a body.

At last, after host and guest had been
alternately victor and vanquished in the
friendly strife, and after some half dozen
of the neighbouring gentlemen had also
breathed their greyhounds, an event occurred
which put an unexpected and most
unintended check to the gaiety of the
meeting. Sir John Firewood, one of the
greatest coursers in England, who was
known to be on a visit to a neighbouring
nobleman, suddenly appeared, attended by
a vast retinue of trainers, and grooms, and
dog-boys, and a stud of some twenty brace

of greyhounds ; and advancing most courteously
to the party, hoping that he should
not be considered as an intruder if he preferred
a request to try the speed of one or
two of his dogs against some of those
present. There was one which he particularly
wished to try against the fleetest
that could be found, as he intended to run
him the next week for the cup at Hertford
Inn, and another that had just won the
goblet at Swaffham. If any gentleman
would favour him with slipping a good
dog against one of these, he should think
himself much honoured.

Whew !" quoth Ben. Ben was dumb-founded
; and, to say the truth, his betters
were rather taken aback. Something one
muttered about Marigold having cut herself,
and another about Nestor having already
run two courses; and the Lord of the
Manor was about to couple a most courteous
refusal of the challenge with a

request that Sir John would run as many
of his own dogs upon the hill as he chose,
when, to the unutterable astonishment of
the whole field, little David led Spider upto
the training groom, and boldly proposed
to run her against the dog who was about
to be entered at Hertford Inn.

"Whew — ew — wl" quoth Ben, with
redoubled energy.

The groom, a tall man mounted upon a
tall horse, looked down upon David with
the sort of scornful astonishment with
which the giant may be supposed to have
eyed the noted " Jack'' of the nursery
legend, and vouchsafed no reply ; but his
master, a thoroughly well-tempered and
kindly person, after enquiring to whom
the pretty little creature belonged, and
hearing from David's chief patron and
protector the story of the boy and his dog,
ordered Harebrain — between whom and
Spider there was nearly the same disproportion

as between the groom and her
master — to be put into the slips.

Whew 1" said Ben again. " She's
really pretty. If she should beat, now !
David and she belong to our party. It's
only right to back 'em up. Hark ye, you
sir upon the great horse, I'll bet you half
a crown upon the little 'un;" shouted he,
as a hare being found, they were led to a
bottom, which, as the hare was sure to
make for the steep ascent, was peculiarly
favourable to the smaller dog.

"Done!" responded the tall groom,
grinning. *has any one else a mind fora
bet ? or will you venture another half
crown, comrade ? "

'^ No !" said Ben, who indeed had only
made this bet in a spirit of good fellowship,
by way of encouragement to David
and protection to a dog who came with his
party. " No more bets, thank ye ! Ah,
she's off ! Now, Spider I "

!sow, Harehrain /" shouted the grooms
and dog-boys. But not long did they
shout. Harehrain^ used to the slips and
eager for the sport, had been nearly a yard
a-head at first starting. But the bitch had
passed him like lightning, strained up
the hill side, gained upon the dog at every
stride, and had finally turned and killed
her hare without HarebrairCs coming in
for a turn.

"Whew — ew — ew !" quoth Ben. "I
beg your pardon, David, for doubting the
bitch. She's a good 'un, sure enough;
and I'm half a crown richer than I thought
I was. Don't go mad about it, though,
David ; nor don't eat Spider up !''

It must be all accident," cried the
training groom, after honourably disbursing
Ben's money, " Have you a mind to
run her again, my little man ? Double or
quits, sir ?"

"Ay! ay I" cried David.

Ay ! ay !'' said Ben.

" The latter worthy was however about
to demur a little, when, instead of the candidate
for the cup at Hertford Inn, he
found them slipping the winner of the
Swaffham goblet. But David stopped him.

"Let her run their best," said he;
" you'll see she'll beat them."

And beat them she did, after a longer
course and a more decided triumph. And
Sir John won the cup after all, not indeed
with Barebrain, but with Spider alias
ffelerij whom he purchased of her master
at so high a rate, that little David returned
to Aberleigh a moneyed man, with a fortune
in the savings-bank, a new suit for
himself, and a new gown for Dame Butler.
